This paper proposes a new research model to examine how CSR affects customer loyalty in intercity bus services and how it interacts with service quality, corporate image and customer satisfaction in affecting customer loyalty. An empirical study on a leading intercity bus company in Taiwan is conducted to test the research model, using structural equation modeling. The study finds that CSR has an indirect effect on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty through corporate image and customer satisfaction respectively as a mediator. In particular, a new finding of the study highlights the importance of the mediating role played by corporate image in enhancing the effect of CSR on customer loyalty. The research findings provide useful insights into how intercity bus companies should develop a CSR policy that would enhance corporate image and customer satisfaction, consequently leading to customer loyalty.","[Chang, Yu-Hern] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Transportat & Commun Management, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Yeh, Chung-Hsing] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",National Cheng Kung University; Monash University,"Yeh, CH (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",yhchang@mail.ncku.edu.tw; chunghsing.yeh@monash.edu,"Yeh, Chung-Hsing/AAF-2816-2020","Yeh, Chung-Hsing/0000-0002-2938-1455",Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 103-2410-H-006-053-MY3],Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology,This research was supported by Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. MOST 103-2410-H-006-053-MY3).

We show that it can be optimal for the intermediary to obfuscate a product-possibly the better one-since this weakens price competition and allows the sellers to extract a greater surplus from buyers; however, it is not socially optimal.

We investigate this issue for forecasts from a range of short-term forecasting models. Our analysis shows that there is considerable variation of the relative performance of the different models over time. To take that into account we suggest employing performance-based forecast combination methods-in particular, one with more weight on the recent forecast performance. We compare such an approach with equal forecast combination that has been found to outperform more sophisticated forecast combination methods in the past, and investigate whether it can improve forecast accuracy over the single best model. The time-varying weights assign weights to the economic interpretations of the forecast stemming from different models. We also include a number of benchmark models in our analysis. The combination methods are evaluated for HICP headline inflation and HICP excluding food and energy. We investigate how forecast accuracy of the combination methods differs between pre-crisis times, the period after the global financial crisis and the full evaluation period, including the global financial crisis with its extraordinary volatility in inflation. Overall, we find that forecast combination helps hedge against bad forecast performance and that performance-based weighting outperforms simple averaging.

According to the IMF (2009), this is the worst recession of the last decades since economies, countries and global GDP have been seriously affected. A sector of the economy that has significantly been impaired is road freight transport. The scope of this paper is to investigate the effect of this crisis on road freight transport in Greece. The analysis starts by examining global and European data and trends while presenting comparable Greek economic and freight transport data for a series of years starting in 2003. This analysis and mapping of data shows some plausible correlations between economic and freight transport indicators and identified visible patterns. The paper examines the possibility of constructing mathematical relations between tonnes or t-km of road freight and GDP for Greece, which were the only relations showing a statistically significant correlation. The overall conclusion is that the impacts on freight transport are visible but quite pronounced as freight transport volumes and output have been substantially unstable or reduced over these years and this trend is visible when mapping the relevant data as well as in more detailed statistical analysis.","[Moschovou, Tatiana P.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Transportat Planning & Engn, 5 Iroon Polytech Str,Zografou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Moschovou, TP (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Transportat Planning & Engn, 5 Iroon Polytech Str,Zografou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece.",tmosch@central.ntua.gr,"Moschovou, Tatiana P./HZJ-2407-2023","Moschovou, Tatiana P./0000-0003-2538-0540",,,,,32,16,16,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We forecast the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot prices using total OECD petroleum inventory levels, surplus production capacity, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index and an implementation of a subset autoregression with exogenous variables (SARX). Coefficient and standard error estimates obtained from SARX determined by conditioning on a single 'best model' ignore model uncertainty and result in underestimated standard errors and overestimated coefficients. We find that the MMI forecast outperforms a single-model forecast for both in-and out-of-sample datasets over a variety of statistical performance measures, and further find that weighting models according to the Bayesian information criterion generally yields superior results both in and out of sample when compared to the Akaike information criterion.

In some cities, taxes on one-hour reservations exceed 30% due to transaction-based fees that apply regardless of the duration of the trip. Interpreted broadly, these results indicate that carsharing is becoming more affordable to urban consumers, while being subject to extensive competition and facing the burden of extensive retail taxes that may hamper efforts to achieve local sustainability goals.","[Schwieterman, Joseph P.] Sch Publ Serv, Chicago, IL USA; [Schwieterman, Joseph P.] Chaddick Inst Metropolitan Dev, Chicago, IL USA; [Bieszczat, Alice] Depaul Univ, 14 E Jackson,Suite 1600, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",DePaul University,"Schwieterman, JP (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, 14 E Jackson,Suite 1600, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",jschwiet@depaul.edu,,,,,,,24,10,13,2,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

A recurring difficulty however faced by policy makers is a disjoint between this motivation and the cost benefit analysis, which may be too narrow. Broadening the set of economic mechanisms studied creates the risk that bad arguments are legitimised and effects can be exaggerated. There is a need for an appraisal framework that ensures all relevant impacts are captured, ensures the opportunity cost of drawing more resources into an activity is identified and meets the needs of the different audiences of the appraisal. There is a need for context specific appraisal. Central to the impact on economic performance is how private sector investment responds to changes in accessibility. Investment in one location can improve productivity, create growth, but may also displace output and employment. Thus we group impacts within the framework into four types: user benefits, proximity and productivity effects, investment and land use impacts and employment effects. Within each of these groups there are a series of transport-economy mechanisms which become relevant in different contexts. Some of these mechanisms are well established and are applied in practice. Others still are more challenging and need to be the subject of further research. Throughout improvements in the evidence base are needed.","[Laird, James J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Leeds; University of Oxford,"Laird, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",J.J.Laird@its.leeds.ac.uk,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",Department for Transport and builds on ITF,Department for Transport and builds on ITF,"This paper is based on research funded by the Department for Transport and builds on ITF discussion paper no 2016-05.

Focusing on executive turnover as an indicator for effective monitoring, the findings reveal that multiple directorships and product market competition are substitutes. Outsiders increase executive turnover in underperforming firms exclusively if competition in the industry is weak. In environments with effective competition, outsiders do not significantly influence the decision to replace underperforming managers. In fiercely competitive industries, the market pressure seems to effectively limit managerial discretion for opportunistic behavior.

The question is, though, how diverse and challenging are these time series, and do they enable us to study the unique strengths and weaknesses of different forecasting methods? This paper proposes a visualisation method for collections of time series that enables a time series to be represented as a point in a two-dimensional instance space. The effectiveness of different forecasting methods across this space is easy to visualise, and the diversity of the time series in an existing collection can be assessed. Noting that the diversity of the M3 dataset has been questioned, this paper also proposes a method for generating new time series with controllable characteristics in order to fill in and spread out the instance space, making our generalisations of forecasting method performances as robust as possible.

One prominent example is the Bialowieza Forest, shared by Poland and Belarus. There is a considerable literature on allocation of funds to preserving nature shared by several countries. Some of this literature assess the funding schemes and the impacts on biodiversity within the EU. A particular challenge for the Bialowieza Forest is that the larger part of it is outside the EU border. There has been less research on the economic benefits that citizens attach to protected transboundary land nature on the other side of the border. We are trying to fill the gap by finding out and comparing preferences towards increased protection of domestic and foreign segments of the transboundary Bialowieza Forest, stated by samples of Polish and Belarusian citizens. The results of a discrete choice experiment show an almost unilateral preference for nature conservation, passive protection of forest land, on the domestic side. Whilst Polish respondents on average are willing to pay for an increased area under protection, on their side of the border, most Belarusians seem to be satisfied with the status quo. Taken at face value, there is even an apparent mutual disutility derived from the perspective of co-financing bilateral passive protection programmes in the Bialowieza Forest. By use of latent class analyses of responses, a group of the Polish sample willing to contribute to the transboundary conservation is identified and described, and compared against the non-cooperative groups on both sides of the border. The results can to some extent be explained by a strict border division with a high fence, by differences in welfare or by behavioural reasons. However, it cannot be ruled out that the affected populations simply do not perceive the Bialowieza Forest as a binational public good.

Since the expected consumer harm directly depends on the level of product usage, the consequences of consumers' mispredictions vary with the prevailing liability regime. We first characterize the consumers' purchasing decision and the equilibrium levels of safety and activity from the product's usage under no liability, strict liability, and negligence rule. We then compare the three legal regimes from the social welfare standpoint. We show that social welfare is highest under no liability when consumers substantially underestimate future product benefits; under strict liability when consumers substantially overestimate future product benefits; and under negligence whenever consumers' misprediction is moderate or nonexistent.","[Baniak, Andrzej] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Grajzl, Peter] Washington & Lee Univ, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Grajzl, Peter] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Central European University; Washington & Lee University; Ifo Institut,"Grajzl, P (通讯作者)，Washington & Lee Univ, Williams Sch, Dept Econ, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",grajzlp@wlu.edu,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

In particular, we argue that risk aversion creates incentives to acquire assets in situations where neither opportunism nor transaction-specific investments are present, provided the assets in question can change in value unpredictably during their use. Our theory illustrates that risk aversion could connect opportunism, asset specificity, and uncertainty with integration decisions in the presence of incomplete contracts. Our theory complements and extends TCE by showing the role of risk aversion in integration decisions under bounded rationality and contract incompleteness.

This paper presents a model of manufacturer-retailer interactions that clarifies why, as a rule, retailers and manufacturers are joint beneficiaries of service-inducing RPM. The model identifies factors that determine how RPM-generated benefits are allocated between a manufacturer and its retailers. The paper then shows that manufacturers may use market share discounts (MSD) in lieu of RPM or other vertical restraints to induce retailer performance. The outcomes and efficiency effects that are achieved with RPM can be replicated and usually surpassed if manufacturers substitute MSD for RPM, thereby enabling a manufacturer to retain all incremental profit rather than conceding some of it to retailers.","[Mills, David E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Mills, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",mills@virginia.edu,"Mills, David/GXF-1821-2022",,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

J,"Nie, Y",,,,"Nie, Yu (Marco)",,,On the potential remedies for license plate rationing,ECONOMICS OF TRANSPORTATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,License plate rationing; Travel demand management; Permit trading; User heterogeneity; New vehicle quota,,"This paper analyzes three travel demand management policies designed to correct the shortcomings of license plate rationing (LPR). The first policy couples LPR with a new vehicle quota scheme that directly controls auto ownership. The other two policies turn the driving permit into a tradable commodity. They differ, however, in that one policy ties the permit to the license plate while the other bestows all travelers with equal driving permits. All new policies may be viewed as derivatives of LPR because they share some key features: simplicity and revenue neutrality. Using a conceptual model that considers two modes (transit and driving) and user heterogeneity, we analyze user equilibrium solutions under each new policy, and for policies based on permit trading, introduce and characterize a function that links individuals' trading behavior to their value of time. Our analysis and numerical experiments show that giving tradable permits to all travelers is more efficient than the other alternatives. Under this policy, travelers who decide to own automobiles will acquire enough permits from those who do not so that the former can drive without any restriction. Consequently, the permit each traveler should receive can be easily determined from the ratio between a desired highway flow level and the total demand. Importantly, when the desired flow level equals the system optimal flow, the policy is revenue-neutral and first-best under idealized conditions.","[Nie, Yu (Marco)] Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Nie, Y (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",y-nie@northwestern.edu,"Nie, Yu/B-7083-2009; Nie, Yu/J-6620-2014","Nie, Yu/0000-0003-2083-470X",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1256021],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The work was partially supported by National Science Foundation under the award number CMMI-1256021.

In this study, we employ a latent class model to investigate the heterogeneity of vehicle ownership behavior, based on the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data. The results show that the households within the CHFS data can be categorized into two classes, and that households within each class rank the importance of socioeconomic variables in significantly different ways. For instance, with regards to deciding to own a vehicle, the households in Class 1 (the income-based class) rank household income as the most important factor, while the households in Class 2 (the comprehensive considerations class) rank household income, household status, and household size as being almost equally important. Further, the model coefficients also reveal the evolution of vehicle ownership in the near future, and how changes in macroeconomic variables may influence household vehicle ownership decisions. In application, the results can be used to assist policy makers in designing policies that control excessively high levels of vehicle ownership; they can also be used to help auto manufacturers pinpoint specific vehicle models to be sold in different regions of China, so as to drive the highest possible profits.","[Zhang, Zhao] Beihang Univ, Sch Transportat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhao; Jin, Wen; Jiang, Hai] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xie, Qianyan; Han, Weijian] Ford Motor Co, Res & Adv Engn, 2101 Village Rd MD-2149, Dearborn, MI 48121 USA; [Shen, Wei] Ford Motor Co, Asia Pacific Res, Unit 4,Tower C,Beijing Yintai Ctr, Beijing 100022, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Tsinghua University; Ford Motor Company,"Jiang, H (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",haijiang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Shen, Wei/AAK-5955-2020","Jiang, Hai/0000-0003-3414-9682; Shen, Wei/0000-0002-1705-6444",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71622006]; Center for Data-Centric Management in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University; Ford University,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for Data-Centric Management in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Tsinghua University; Ford University,"The China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data were provided by the Survey and Research Center of China Household Finance, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China.

Empirical researchers often utilize the standard deviation of the moving average of the logarithm of the exchange rate as a measure of exchange rate fluctuation. In this study, a new measure for measuring volatility is proposed. The empirical methodology used relies upon the theory of cointegration, error correction representation of the exchange rate volatility measures using the Autoregressive Distributed Lags modeling to cointegration. Overall, our findings suggest that there is a negative effect of volatility to tourist arrivals for Korea.","[Agiomirgianakis, George] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Social Sci, Parodos Aristotelous 18, Patras 26335, Greece; [Serenis, Dimitrios] Coventry Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Accounting, William Morris Bldg,94 Gosford St, Coventry CV1 5DL, W Midlands, England; [Tsounis, Nicholas] Western Macedonia Univ Appl Sci, Dept Int Trade, Kastoria 52100, Greece; [Tsounis, Nicholas] Hellen Open Univ, Patras, Greece",Hellenic Open University; Coventry University; Hellenic Open University,"Serenis, D (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Accounting, William Morris Bldg,94 Gosford St, Coventry CV1 5DL, W Midlands, England.",gmagios@eap.gr; dseren01@yahoo.com; tsounis@kastoria.teikoz.gr,"Agiomirgianakis, George M./P-8246-2018","Agiomirgianakis, George M./0000-0003-4977-2178",,,,,19,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,861,872,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_58,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400058,0

We extract the sample, ratios examined, findings and conclusions of these empirical studies. The results of these academic researches show that there is no common agreement. However the changes of lease accounting and the constructive capitalization of operating leases will mostly influence the financial statements and the key accounting ratios. In this paper, we focus deliberately the papers that assess the changes to lessee accounting because the new lease standard IFRS 16 Leases, which was published in 13 January 2016, substantially changed the lessees' requirements.

Yield risk constitutes an important factor of farming business viability. As the Central and Eastern European countries have been affected by both economic and environmental transformations, there is a need to develop a robust methodology for assessment of yield risks in order to propose convincing guidelines for both farmers and government institutions in regards to risk management and viability of agricultural business in general. This paper attempts to devise non-parametric measures of yield risk for Lithuanian crop farming. The research covers the period of 2000-2015. County-level data from Statistics Lithuania are employed for the analysis. The non-parametric analysis of yield risk relies on information diffusion theory and linear moving average. The results indicate that there exist differences in yield trends, yield loss rates and yield risk among crops and regions. Maize, buckwheat and winter rape exhibited the highest yield risk. These results shed light on the extent of yield risks underlying crop farming in Lithuania and, to a certain extent, can be contrasted to situation in Central and Eastern European countries. Indeed, the obtained results can be applied in decision making at different levels of management.","[Balezentis, Tomas; Streimikiene, Dalia; Melnikiene, Rasa] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Kudirkos G 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Yu, Zhiqian] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, 230 Wai Huan Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Guangzhou University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Kudirkos G 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas@laei.lt; dalia@mail.lei.lt; rasa.melnikiene@laei.lt; yzq_8866@hotmail.com,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",Youth Talents Project of Guangdong Province [2015WQNCX122]; Youth Academic Team Project at Guangzhou University [201602XSTD],Youth Talents Project of Guangdong Province; Youth Academic Team Project at Guangzhou University,Zhiqian Yu gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Youth Talents Project of Guangdong Province (2015WQNCX122) and the Youth Academic Team Project at Guangzhou University (201602XSTD).,,27,6,7,1,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We use the latitude of country's centroid to measure the absolute location effect owing to geography (GEO). The spatial diagnostics indicates that there is a spatial autocorrelation. The obtained results indicate that we have to use the spatial error model rather than the spatial lag model. These effects have been modeled by using spatial error model and by using a spatial weight matrix. In this framework, the corruption control is strongly and positively related to the economic growth rate than the geography. The control of corruption has a dominant role than geographical factor to determine the growth in MENA region.

Further, when a company has high credit rating, its debt financing ratio has no effect on its performance, while a company with low credit rating; it performs better as debt financing ratio increases. The findings can be applied by CFOs (Chief Finance Officers) in retail companies to build an efficient capital structure when considering the companies' credit ratings.

But while it is highly likely that these changes relate to far-reaching alterations in travel behaviour as well, so far this topic has received much less attention. With this paper, we aim to help fill this gap through the following research questions: What are the main changes in travel behaviour in Nanjing, China; and how can we explain these changes? We answer these questions on the basis of a study of repeated cross-sectional data from the Nanjing Residents Travel Survey (NRTS) of 2008 and 2011. This leads to three main conclusions: first, changes in the urban form and transport systems of Chinese cities lead to larger daily travel distances and a considerable increase of transport by private cars and public transport at the expense of non-motorised transport modes; second, the impacts of the built environment and socio-demographics as determinants for travel behaviour change in different ways over time; and third, changes are not the same for all groups as there is a widening gap in travel behaviour of low-income groups and middle and high-income groups. We discuss the consequences for social exclusion and environmental sustainability.

Using the results of the forecast, the management has the possibility to compare the real results to the forecasted ones, to identify their deviations, study the causes and elaborate efficient policies and strategies. The intelligent system and statistical tools can act as preventive elements, capable of signalling significant deviations, being a real guardian of the business.

To the best knowledge of the authors, it is the first study on the consequences that the elimination of a national currency may have for that feature of trade. According to the Ricardian and Hechscher-Ohlin models of trade, such a policy decision (seen as an example of trade liberalization) may lead to specialization in the production of either more or less sophisticated goods - the outcome depends on the country's technology and factor endowment. At the same time, increased FDI flows may make a particular economy more engaged in international production chains, with an ambiguous influence on export complexity. Given the fact that it is impossible to (a priori) theoretically predict the impact of monetary integration on export complexity, it is reasonable to search for the effects of the integration empirically. The authors used the Synthetic Control Method to compare the actual levels of export complexity in Slovenia after the adoption of the euro with the counterfactual scenario with Slovenia not entering the Eurozone. The results indicate that membership in the European Monetary Union (EMU) led to a temporary increase in the complexity of exported goods.","[Gabrielczak, Piotr] Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Macroecon, 3-5 POW St,Room A416, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland; [Serwach, Tomasz] Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Int Trade, 3-5 POW St,Room A216, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland",,"Gabrielczak, P (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Macroecon, 3-5 POW St,Room A416, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland.",pgabrielczak@uni.lodz.pl; serwachtomasz@uni.lodz.pl,"Serwach, Tomasz/AAQ-8031-2020","Serwach, Tomasz/0000-0002-8253-1029; Gabrielczak, Piotr/0000-0002-9032-7204","National Science Centre of Poland (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) [DEC-2014/13/N/HS4/02977, UMO-2014/13/N/HS4/02977]",National Science Centre of Poland (Narodowe Centrum Nauki),The research project was financed by means of the National Science Centre of Poland (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) granted upon decision number DEC-2014/13/N/HS4/02977 (contract number: UMO-2014/13/N/HS4/02977).,,57,5,5,0,1,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Using a convenience sampling method, we made 17 interviews with full-time white-collar workers in different sectors. We adopted an inductive approach, in which we aim to reach some general conclusions about mobbing experiences of white-collar employees. There are many possible and usually multiple causes of workplace bullying; causes within the organization, the perpetrator, the victim or the social environment, which are often interconnected.

Secondly, we utilize Akerlof's hypothesis on the relationship between an employer and an employee which is as predicted very reciprocal, similarly to the gifts exchange paradigm. We show that the more the employee thinks s/he is trusted by the employer, the harder and more efficiently s/he works. Thirdly, we show several instances of the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in employees and how those two motivations interfere with each other and crowd each other out in some situations. The research shows that meaningfulness of the work can be a significant driver of the employees' efficiency as well. In the last section devoted to employees we provide evidence on the impacts of relative performance compensation on cooperation, reciprocity, and sabotage in firms. The last part is devoted to analysing behavioural regularities of managers in their day-to-day decision-making. The overview briefly expands particularly on their over-optimism and on their possibly undeserved remuneration resulting from random events and market changes rather than from the managerial skills. The article concludes by proposing possible directions for further field research.","[Houdek, Petr] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Houdek, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Houdek, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Philosophy & Hist, Prague, Czech Republic; [Koblovsky, Petr] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Koblovsky, Petr] Inst Behav & Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Houdek, P (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.;Houdek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic.;Houdek, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Philosophy & Hist, Prague, Czech Republic.",petr.houdek@ujep.cz; petr.koblovsky@aya.yale.edu,"Houdek, Petr/D-8818-2014","Houdek, Petr/0000-0001-9755-6635",,,,,53,8,8,3,38,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The research aim - to analyze the tendencies of elderly people economic possibilities. The following tasks were set in order to reach the aim of the research: 1) to identify the factors of economic possibilities; 2) to investigate the possibilities of the participation of the elderly people in the labour market. The article discusses factors determining economic possibilities of elderly people, describes the possibilities of elderly people participation in the labour market, analyzes employment trends, income of this age group. Economic possibilities for elderly people are enhanced by using implements which are related with elimination of the direct or indirect age barriers, creating the environment where a person could develop his capabilities without experiencing negative effects considering his age. Study results suggest that economic possibilities of elderly people depend on employment opportunities, income, education, gender, etc. During the coming years, there are likely to be considerable changes in the demographic profile of the EU's labour force. In the future proportion of the elderly people will remain in work longer, some people will work for economic reasons.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether such relation holds in the emerging markets such as Korea. Our preliminary OLS analysis reports that Korean customer satisfaction is irrelevant to firm value. Quantile regressions, applied for further analysis, report that customer satisfaction can be detrimental to firm value if the firm is enjoying the higher kind of value. These results undermine efforts, on the theoretical level, to establish Customer Satisfaction Index as a consolidated firm-value indicator; furthermore, managerial efforts to boost up firm value by managing customer satisfaction lose ground in the emerging markets. This study also corroborates Reinartz and Kumar's (2002) marketing insight that to satisfy customers, make them loyal, is trivial for profitability and firm value in Korea perspective. The practical implication of our finding is that the relation between customer satisfaction and firm value becomes more ambiguous, especially when it is considered in the emerging market contexts. It also provides management with a fresh new insight that they should take prudence when they increase expenses on customer satisfaction since it turned out to be not a panacea.","[Kim, Hyunseok; Choi, Kyeong-Seop] Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKK Business Sch, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Kim, Jaisang] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Shidler Coll Business, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Choi, KS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKK Business Sch, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",khs8319@naver.com; jaisang@hawaii.edu; kyeongchoi78@hanmail.net,,"Choi, Kyeong-Seop/0000-0001-6413-9229",,,,,45,5,6,1,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The EGARCH model was the best fitting model for the equity indices for Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa, whilst the result obtained delivered no clear best fitting model for the Vietnamese VN-Index. In addition, there is evidence of the leverage effect for all the Indices included in this study with the exception of the Vietnamese VN-Index. The presence of leverage effects implies that a negative shock will lead to greater volatility.

The research shows that during financial crisis systems are under-funded, and when the insured event happens it becomes costly to taxpayers due to non-cumulative amount in the deposit insurance fund. Therefore, this article provides an assessment model of the contributions of Lithuanian banks to the risk-based deposit insurance systems while using a multiple-indicator model, which is regarded as one of the priority models in order to modernise the deposit insurance system. The research of risk-based premiums is performed based on the example of Lithuanian banks with regard to the European Commission (2010) multiple-indicator model and a study carried out by Gomez Fernandez-Aguado et al. (2013), taking into account the guidelines of Draft European Parliament legislative resolution (2013) while modelling different risk coefficient range limits (Model 1 and Model 2). In order to base the risk of the banks that are paying contributions to the deposit insurance system in Lithuania, the total composite score of underwriting based on calculated and evaluated parameters highlighted the differences between the three major banks that share the market with smaller banks, depending on the economic situation. However, the study shows that contributions to the deposit insurance system by most major banks would increase while applying the model of the European Commission (2010) and Gomez Fernandez-Aguado et al. (2013) (Model 1). This is confirmed by the results of the study of Gomez Fernandez-Aguado et al. (2013) in Spain. The study showed that the volatility of bank contributions is high and the impact on the current contributions would significantly vary depending on the setting of the risk coefficient range limit (Model I and Model 2). It can be concluded that the setting of the risk coefficient range limit has not only a huge impact on estimating overall risk situation of an individual bank, but also on the contribution level from separate banks. Therefore, it is recommended that contributions to the deposit insurance system would be determined for each member in the proportion to the degree of the risk level incurred.","[Lakstutiene, Ausrine] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Witkowska, Justyna] Univ Warmia & Mazury, M Oczapowski 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland; [Leskauskiene, Edita] JSC Infraplanas, K Donelaicio Str 55-2, LT-44245 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Lakstutiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.lt; justyna.witkowska@uwm.edu.pl; e.leskauskiene@infraplanas.lt,"Witkowska, Justyna/ADH-4952-2022","Witkowska, Justyna/0000-0001-8478-0769",,,,,31,2,2,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Further, it is found that, whether it is in monetary policy easing period or tightening period, debt maturity structure is greater in low industry prosperity than in high industry prosperity; debt maturity structure is greater in monetary policy tightening period with low (high) industry prosperity than in monetary policy easing period with low (high) industry prosperity. The research of this paper shows that when studying the debt maturity structure of agricultural listed companies, we should consider both the influence of different monetary policy environment and the influence of the industry prosperity.","[Li Sicheng; Liu Lingzhi] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University,"Liu, LZ (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lisic@mail.hzau.edu.cn; liulingzhi@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,,special funds for the industrial technology system construction of modem agriculture [CARS-42-28]; fundamental research funds for the central universities [2662016QD054],special funds for the industrial technology system construction of modem agriculture; fundamental research funds for the central universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This paper is supported by the special funds for the industrial technology system construction of modem agriculture (Program No. CARS-42-28) and the fundamental research funds for the central universities (Program No. 2662016QD054).,,31,1,1,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The window of opportunity for Japan to forge ahead of the UK was the arrival and employment of new technologies, a method referred to as welding block. The Japanese firms also adopted path-creation, a strategy that involves the use of innovations more promptly than the incumbent UK, which had delayed adoption due to the opposition of labour unions. The leadership shift from Japan to Korea also represents path-creation given that Korean firms responded quickly to the rise of a new window of opportunity (i.e. systematised 3D computer-aided design technologies) and met the newly rising demand in large vessels that was the second window of opportunity. Both of these cases of path-creation are an adoption and follow-on innovation mode because the latecomers not only adopted new technologies, but also reinvented them further into a new system of production. This study also finds the unique, institutional nature of the source of the incumbent trap in the shipbuilding industry, which is different from that associated with the relative costs and benefits of new versus old technologies. In addition, this study identifies the peculiarity of the technological regimes of the shipbuilding sector and the associated unique nature of the technological window of opportunity, which are not merely competence-destroying innovations of component technologies but a consolidation of a new systematised technology that has changed the entire process of shipbuilding.","[Lim, Chaisung] Konkuk Univ, Miller Sch MOT, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Younghun] Kyung Nam Univ, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & IT Engn, Chang Won, South Korea; [Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",Institute of Economic Research (its Center for National Competitiveness) of Seoul National University; Konkuk University in Korea,Institute of Economic Research (its Center for National Competitiveness) of Seoul National University; Konkuk University in Korea,"The corresponding author acknowledge the financial support from the Institute of Economic Research (its Center for National Competitiveness) of Seoul National University, and the first author, from Konkuk University in Korea.",,46,12,12,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The findings of this study may be relevant not only for the university where investigation has carried out. The outcome can be very helpful for other medical faculties, which train foreign students or intend to internationalize their teaching process, in order to address better to the specificity of teaching medicine to foreigners and to develop a strategy that does not concentrate only on low tuition fees, but also on the quality of education provided. In addition, the results of this study may be useful to the authorities in identifying the barriers perceived by foreign graduates in continuing their practice as doctors in Romania.","[Marinoiu, Ana-Maria; Wahed, Laura; Zaharia, Rodica Milena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, CCREI, Dept Int Business & Econ, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Zaharia, Razvan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Mkt, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Marinoiu, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, CCREI, Dept Int Business & Econ, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",anamarinoiu@yahoo.com; laura.wahed@yahoo.com; razvan.zaharia@gmail.com; milena_zaharia@yahoo.com,"Zaharia, Rodica Milena/AAT-8093-2021; Zaharia, Razvan/G-3207-2016","Zaharia, Razvan/0000-0002-3883-7645",,,,,42,0,0,0,3,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Firstly, it adds to the small but growing body of literature focusing on the decomposition of South Africa's export growth. Secondly, it identifies the determinants of the intensive and extensive margins of South Africa's exports - a topic that (as far as the authors are concerned) has not been explored before. Aim: This paper aims to investigate a wide range of market access determinants that affect South Africa's export growth along the intensive and extensive margins. Setting: Export diversification has been identified as one of the critical pillars of South Africa's much-hoped-for economic revival. Although recent years have seen the country's export product mix evolving, there is still insufficient diversification into new markets with high value-added products. This is putting a damper on export performance as a whole and, in turn, hindering South Africa's economic growth. Methods: A Heckman selection gravity model is applied using highly disaggregated data. The first stage of the process revealed the factors affecting the probability of South Africa exporting to a particular destination (extensive margin). The second stage, which modelled trade flows, revealed the variables that affect export volumes (intensive margin). Results: The results showed that South Africa's export product mix is relatively varied, but the number of export markets is limited. In terms of the extensive margin (or the probability of exporting), economic variables such as the importing country's GDP and population have a positive impact on firms' decision to export. Other factors affecting the extensive margin are distance to the market (negative impact), cultural or language fit (positive impact), presence of a South African embassy abroad (positive impact), existing free trade agreement with Southern African Development Community (positive impact) and trade regulations and costs (negative impact). In terms of the intensive margin (or the factors influencing the volume of exports), there are strong parallels with the extensive margin, with the exception being that the time involved in exporting has more of an impact than documentary requirements. Conclusion: Among the factors contributing to South Africa's exports having largely developed in the intensive margin are a general lack of market-related information, infrastructural weaknesses (both of a physical and technological nature) and a difficult regulatory environment - all of which add to the cost and time involved in exporting. Policymakers have long spoken about the need for the country to diversify its export basket, but now talk about needs to give way to action. The government and its economic partners need to arrive at a common vision of an export sector that will be able to expand into new products and markets, be an active participant in global value chains and deliver sustainable jobs.","[Matthee, Marianne] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Santana-Gallego, Maria] Univ Balearic Isl, Palma De Mallorca, Islas Baleares, Spain",North West University - South Africa; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Matthee, M (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",marianne.matthee@nwu.ac.za,"Santana, Maria/H-9163-2015; Matthee, Marianne/AAU-6454-2021","Santana, Maria/0000-0001-5977-7875; Matthee, Marianne/0000-0002-4679-9757",National Research Foundation of South Africa [90709],National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"This work is based on the research supported in part by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number 90709).

Macroeconomic indicators of each country are more exposed to shocks arising in the country and in partner countries. In this paper, we propose a model of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) of many countries. For each country, the variables of output, inflation, interest rate, exchange rate, terms of trade, as well as exports and imports for each pair of countries are included in the model. In accordance with the number of countries the model contains equations of dynamic IS and New Keynesian Phillips curves and equations of monetary policy. The estimation of the model was implemented for the economies of Kazakhstan, Russia and the EU. An asymmetrical interaction of large and small economies is taken into account. The analysis of the impact of internal and external shocks on the macroeconomic variables is performed for each country/region. Responses of indicators on various shocks are obtained. For example, a positive technology shock in the country leads to the negative reaction of output, inflation and interest rate variables, as well as having a positive impact on imports and the negative impact on exports in each partner country. Cost-push as well as monetary policy shocks reduce imports and increase exports, and this is also observed for a couple of countries where there is no such a shock. It is revealed that the value of the response does matter to the size of the economy. The model allows analyzing the effects of the macroeconomic policies of trading partners to the fluctuations of the various shocks. The model can be extended in various directions.","[Mukhamediyev, Bulat; Khitakhunov, Azimzhan] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Al-Farabi Kazakh National University,"Mukhamediyev, B (通讯作者)，Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan.",bmukhamediyev@gmail.com; xit8_89@mail.ru,"Mukhamediyev, Bulat/P-5157-2014; Khitakhunov, Azimzhan/AAS-4417-2020","Mukhamediyev, Bulat/0000-0002-1490-302X;",,,,,14,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,63,87,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_4,0.0,,,25,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000004,0

The findings provide evidence that social prestige customer perceives and their positive attitude toward functional food which are main factors influencing on consumers' purchase intention. Customer's perceived prestige plays an important role in decision-making process to purchase. The higher social prestige taken up in consumers' mind, the higher consumers' purchase intention is. Moreover, the more positive attitude customer holds toward functional food, the higher consumers' purchase intention.

Partly as a result, the Nigerian government proposed the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as an automotive fuel in 1997 as part of the efforts to harness the country's natural gas resources and address transportation energy challenges. However, the rate of adoption has been very low with natural gas vehicles constituting 0.04% of the national vehicle fleet. This paper presents a stakeholder analysis derived from interviews with senior executives of the leading organisations involved in the energy and transportation sectors in Nigeria. Analysis revealed thirty-one barriers and twenty-six policy proposals that were categorised into eight and four themes respectively. While there is a rarity of agreement across all stakeholder groups, we observed consensus on the suggestion for the removal of the subsidy on petrol and the need for the establishment of a coordinating agency to drive the use of CNG.

Four experiments have investigated the extent to which the implicit weighting depends on the advisor's experienced (reflecting the accuracy of their past forecasts), or presumed (based on their status) credibility. Compared to a control group, advice from a source with a high experienced credibility received a greater weighting, but having a low level of experienced credibility did not reduce the weighting. In contrast, a high presumed credibility did not increase the weighting relative to a control group, while a low presumed credibility decreased it. When there were opportunities for the two types of credibility to interact, a high experienced credibility tended to eclipse the presumed credibility if the advisees were non-experts. However, when the advisees were professionals, both the presumed and experienced credibility of the advisor were influential in determining the weight attached to the advice.

This reconstruction depends on the choice of the components from the covariance decomposition of the trajectory matrix. In most applications, this selection is based on the prior knowledge and experience of the researcher and a variety of practical rules. This paper suggests an alternative fully automated approach where all components of the covariance decomposition are used via exponential smoothing of the covariance eigenvalues. We illustrate the validity of the proposed approximation via simulations on different data generating processes. A second contribution of the paper is the proposal of a forecast revision algorithm which combines SSA with a benchmark. An empirical exercise using four key macroeconomic variables shows how this method can be used to improve the out of -sample forecasts of any given benchmark model. Our results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to partly automate the use of SSA. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The contribution is formulated via merging risk management and business continuity concepts. The formulation of an integrated business continuity management policy includes the proactive determination of approximate recovery timeframes for critical business functions. Practically, this estimation is based on recovery tests which are executed under ideal conditions, and unexpected factors which may emerge during a real process interruption and significantly delay its recovery are ignored. Agriculture is a domain where the incorporation of an integrated business continuity management system is a crucial issue. The interruption of agricultural computerized activities can be triggered by and can result to various undesirable environmental phenomena. Thus, especially for agriculture, the consideration of unexpected factors when executing recovery tests is highly demanded. The currently presented algorithm accepts as initial input the estimated recovery time which is based on recovery exercises executed under ideal conditions. Then, a precise number of potential unpredictable hazards ( factors) are taken into consideration and the risk magnitude of each threat is semi-quantitatively estimated. The total risk magnitude is utilized to estimate the time deviation from the initially defined recovery time. After the risk analysis process is terminated, a new recovery timeframe is proposed. The time deviation from the initially defined recovery time is calculated in its absolute value. The algorithm is finally validated by applying the calculated extended timeframe to the system availability formula which measures the achieved system availability levels for any information system. The validation of the approach is demonstrated via a practical case study from the agricultural domain, namely the greenhouse irrigation scheduling system interruption scenario.","[Podaras, Athanasios] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Podaras, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec, Czech Republic.",athanasios.podaras@tul.cz,"Podaras, Athanasios/AAB-1580-2020","Podaras, Athanasios/0000-0003-4573-8976",,,,,28,1,2,0,5,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The starting point for further consideration is defining individual, aggregate and total longevity risks in a pension system. Next section of the article presents the current design of the Polish pension system. On this basis, in the third part of the article, the exposure of Polish pension system to the risk of longevity has been analyzed. Particular attention has been paid to the analysis of public structures and supplementary pension schemes in the phase of payment of benefits (decumulation). The author argues that the institutional design of the payout phase of Polish pension system does not include instruments which could guarantee adequate protection against the risk of longevity. While in the public retirement system the aggregate longevity risk (mortality trend risk) exists, the participants of additional pension systems are exposed to individual longevity risk (the risk of outliving their additional pension savings). The limitation of these risks requires significant structural changes both in public and additional pension schemes in Poland.","[Szczepanski, Marek] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, Chair Econ Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Technology,"Szczepanski, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, Chair Econ Sci, Poznan, Poland.",marek.szczepanski@put.poznan.pl,"SZCZEPAŃSKI, MAREK/N-1685-2014","SZCZEPAŃSKI, MAREK/0000-0002-8929-7490",,,,,18,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,705,714,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_44,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000044,0

We demonstrate that marketing innovations are conducive to firm growth if they complement product innovations, but they are less likely to foster growth when applied in isolation.","[Szczygielski, Krzysztof] Univ Warsaw, Dept Macroecon & Int Trade Theory, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Szczygielski, Krzysztof; Woodward, Richard] CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland; [Grabowski, Wojciech] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Econometr Models & Forecasts, Lodz, Poland; [Woodward, Richard] Univ Edinburgh, Strategy Grp, Sch Business, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Warsaw; University of Lodz; University of Edinburgh,"Woodward, R (通讯作者)，CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland.;Woodward, R (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Strategy Grp, Sch Business, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",Rick.Woodward@ed.ac.uk,"Grabowski, Wojciech/A-1497-2013; Grabowski, Wojciech/AED-6500-2022; Szczygielski, Krzysztof/ABA-7401-2020","Grabowski, Wojciech/0000-0002-6707-3736; Szczygielski, Krzysztof/0000-0002-7599-1115",Seventh Framework Programme [244 552],Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the Seventh Framework Programme [grant number 244 552].,,40,11,13,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Since the 2008 crash and the onset of the eurozone crisis, London has faced threats to both its autonomy from external regulatory demands and to its offshore business interests at the same time as the long-standing external statecraft of British governments around EU membership has broken down. The Cameron governments' efforts to protect the City within the European Union under political conditions that were transformed by the eurozone crisis exposed the limits of Britain's position as a member of the European Union. When David Cameron then tried to resolve the problem of EU membership through a referendum he made it extremely difficult to defend the City's broader commercial interests in the Single European Market because freedom of movement issues weighed significantly more in British domestic politics than financial services.","[Thompson, Helen] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England",University of Cambridge,"Thompson, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England.",het20@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,29,29,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Importantly, we extract the principal components for the FAVAR from a large data set containing a range of forward looking macroeconomic and financial variables. Our forecasting model improves on the predictive accuracy of extant models in the literature significantly, particularly at short-term horizons. For instance, the mean absolute forecast errors are 15-40% lower than those of the random walk benchmark on predictions at the three-month horizon. The out of-sample analysis shows that the inclusion of forward-looking indicators is the key to improving the predictive ability of the model. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters.

It also effects on economic disparities between regions. Accordingly, researches have been carried out on the economic effects of establishing transportation infrastructure. On one hand, establishing transportation infrastructure could be the important means for correcting disparities. Conversely, establishing transportation has the potential to bring about greater economic inequality between regions. This study created an inter-regional computational general equilibrium model to analyze the effect of establishing high speed rail (HSR) on the regional economy. A simulation analysis is performed by applying the model to the opening of Kyushu HSR. In base scenario with one route operation, economic scale grew in each region and discrepancies widened between prefectures. While we observed a growth for population, jobs, and economic scale in the regions with improved access, a decline in the population in other prefectures was noticed. In the case of jobs and economic scale, growth is observed in every prefecture. However as the degree of such growth was small, disparities widened. By establishing HSR over a wider area, the degree of growth disparity weakened, and growth approached a proportional pattern. The hypothetical scenarios, which consider the non-availability of the transfer of HSR between Kyushu and outside Kyushu are also simulated.","[Hiramatsu, Tomoru] Kindai Univ, Fac Appl Sociol, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan",Kindai University (Kinki University),"Hiramatsu, T (通讯作者)，Kindai Univ, Fac Appl Sociol, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.",hiramatsu@socio.kindai.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [26870793, 17871198]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26870793] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number 26870793 and 17871198.",,31,25,29,4,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

They have been in operation in Austria on the Vienna Salzburg line from 2011, in the Czech Republic on the Prague-Ostrava line from 2011, and in Slovakia on the Zilina-Kosice line from 2014. These open access entries are all on principal domestic railway lines and have caused major increases in train frequencies. New entrants have introduced many service innovations and utilized aggressive price cuts. As a result, they have been able to win substantial market shares from incumbents. This article compares the impacts of open access entries on the development of railway markets in Central Europe. The comparison covers entry barriers, business models, market developments, and regulatory challenges. The main results are that open access competition has strongly stimulated ridership, but the impact on market revenues has been only moderate due to price reductions. The total costs on the market went up and both newcomers and incumbents are struggling with the profitability of their open access operations. We conclude that open access passenger rail services in Central Europe have led not only to significant benefits for customers but also cost increases and significant regulatory challenges.","[Tomes, Zdenek; Jandova, Monika] Masaryk Univ Brno, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Tomes, Z (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ Brno, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",tomes@econ.muni.cz; jandova@econ.muni.cz,"Jandová, Monika/IZD-5698-2023; Tomes, Zdenek/AAB-5013-2021","Tomes, Zdenek/0000-0002-6759-1293; Jandova, Monika/0000-0001-5562-883X","Operational Programme Research, Development and Education; project New Mobility -High -Speed Transport Systems and Transport-Related Human Behaviour [CCZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008430]","Operational Programme Research, Development and Education; project New Mobility -High -Speed Transport Systems and Transport-Related Human Behaviour","We thank the participants of two dedicated workshops on open access competition in Madrid (September 2016) and Brno (November 2016) for their valuable insights and inspiration on this topic.

At the end of the first period, the board receives a noisy signal of the incumbent manager's ability and decides whether to retain or replace the incumbent manager. We show that severance pay can be utilized in the optimal contract to provide a credible commitment to a lenient second-period equilibrium replacement policy, mitigating the first-period moral hazard problem. Unlike existing models that aim to rationalize managerial entrenchment, we identify conditions on the information structure under which both entrenchment and anti-entrenchment emerge in the optimal contract. Specifically, our model predicts that it is optimal for the board to design a contract to induce entrenchment (respectively, anti-entrenchment) if the signal regarding the incumbent manager's ability becomes sufficiently uninformative (respectively, informative).","[Wu, Zenan] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Weng, Xi] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Wu, ZN (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zenan@pku.edu.cn; wengxi125@gsm.pku.edu.cn,,"Weng, Xi/0000-0001-8383-0461",,,,,26,2,3,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In contrast to most scholars and policymakers who believe legal and regulatory oversight is key, Henry Manne's Mergers and the Market for Corporate Control describes a private or entirely invisible hand mechanism for disciplining managers to work for shareholders. The more underperforming firms have depressed stock prices, the more they become targets for buyouts and restructuring with new management. Funding much of these acquisitions is the private equity industry and its use of leveraged buyouts. Such buyouts concentrate ownership in the hands of private equity managers, and the high amount of leverage they use provides strong incentives for private equity managers to implement beneficial reforms. The expansion of private equity has helped to restructure scores of underperforming firms, has benefited equity and debt investors in this alternative investment space, and has enhanced corporate governance in society. This invisible hand mechanism works well and the recent expansion of control over the private equity industry by the securities and exchange industry is unwarranted.","[Stringham, Edward; Vogel, Jack] Trinity Coll, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Stringham, Edward] Amer Inst Econ Res, Great Barrington, MA 01230 USA",Trinity College,"Stringham, E (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.;Stringham, E (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Econ Res, Great Barrington, MA 01230 USA.",edward.stringham@trincoll.edu,,,,,,,52,2,3,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Designing fair policies in transportation is critical since transport networks are generally recognized as public goods. Moreover, the effects of road pricing may be significantly different for travellers from different geographical regions. Hence, any revenue collected from road pricing or infrastructure funding policies ought to be appropriately redistributed among the population of different geographical regions. In this work, we focus on spatial equity in the road pricing revenue assignment problem. We examine well-known fairness schemes commonly discussed in the literature: opportunity fairness, proportional fairness (individual value and marginal value), and market fairness. We conduct an axiomatic characterization of these schemes to demonstrate their properties and highlight their policy implications. We then present a practical implementation of the proposed fair pricing revenue assignment mechanisms on Winnipeg's downtown network. The results reveal that market fairness is the most axiomatically restrictive scheme and that this scheme is related to individual value and proportional value proportional fairness under specific conditions. We also demonstrate a paradoxical situation where a market or marginal value proportional fair assignment requires a certain group to pay taxes, because they receive more benefits than other groups. In turn, opportunity fairness is shown to be the least restrictive revenue assignment scheme and to require minimal computational resources.","[Li, Xun; Rey, David; Dixit, Vinayak V.] UNSW Sydney, UNSW Australia, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Res Ctr Integrated Transportat Innovat rCITI, Civil Engn Bldg H20,Room LG9, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Li, X (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, UNSW Australia, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Res Ctr Integrated Transportat Innovat rCITI, Civil Engn Bldg H20,Room LG9, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",xun.li@unsw.edu.au; d.rey@unsw.edu.au; v.dixit@unsw.edu.au,"Rey, David/AAW-8123-2020","Rey, David/0000-0002-1577-3845; Dixit, Vinayak/0000-0001-7643-409X",,,,,51,7,8,4,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

We examine whether such criticisms are applicable to settlements struck by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). We reach a number of important findings. First, the total number of parties sanctioned and the total amount of payments made to the OSC increased after the 2008 financial crisis, although these numbers decreased in subsequent years. Second, there is no discernible trend in the types of proceedings by which cases were concluded, although the OSC does use settlements more than other provincial regulators. Third, corporations, first-time offenders, and financial service companies are more likely than individuals or repeat offenders to settle and the OSC tends to settle less often when the case involves serious offences such as fraud or manipulation. Finally, penalties imposed as a result of a settlement were not statistically different than those imposed in a hearing. Interestingly, while there are outliers, financial service companies did not pay higher penalties than other parties, nor did repeat offenders although this has recently changed with the introduction of no-contest settlements. Our data support the idea that regulatory activity follows a cyclical pattern and, following a crisis, regulatory activity increases.

It may, for example, be desirable to stimulate passengers to switch from crowded buses and over to higher capacity rail. This requires a good understanding of drivers of transit modal substitution. The evidence put forward in this paper is based on more than 150 empirically estimated cross elasticities between PT modes from over 20 sources collected from Australia, Europe and USA. These sources include scientifically published evidence as well as grey literature. This evidence is coded into a database from which our paper presents and analyses the available cross-PT-modal demand relations. We focus on evidence for how fares, travel time and service intervals on PT 'mode A' affect the demand for PT 'mode B'. Despite generally low levels of substitution between PT modes, passengers are particularly sensitive to in vehicle, access/egress and waiting time in choosing PT mode and less so for fare variations. In general, rail demand is less sensitive to changes in bus than bus demand is to changes in rail. We also find that peak-hour demand more markedly switches between PT modes than off-peak demand does.","[Fearnley, Nils; Flugel, Stefan; Gregersen, Fredrik A.; Killi, Marit] Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Currie, Graham] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Toner, Jeremy] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Wardman, Mark] SYSTRA, Manchester, Lancs, England",Institute of Transport Economics; Monash University; University of Leeds,"Fearnley, N (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",naf@toi.no; graham.currie@monash.edu; sfl@toi.no; fag@toi.no; mki@toi.no; jtoner@its.leeds.ac.uk; mwardman@outlook.com,"Currie, Graham/ABC-6611-2020; Fearnley, Nils/AAE-7449-2020; Currie, Graham/P-5431-2019; Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023","Fearnley, Nils/0000-0001-5665-0246; Currie, Graham/0000-0001-7190-7548; Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829",Research Council of Norway as part of the 'Crossmodar project [246836],Research Council of Norway as part of the 'Crossmodar project,"The work leading to this paper work is financed by the Research Council of Norway as part of the 'Crossmodar project (grant number 246836).

Econometric analyses suggest that the evolution of export product space in China is heavily driven by relatedness between export products, indicating that regional industrial diversification is path-dependent. Chinese national and local governments can exert significant influence on the evolution of export products by using export and FDI-related policies and by establishing development zones.

To capture salient features commonly observed in financial time series like rapid changes in the conditional variance, non-normality of the measurement errors and sharply increasing trends, we develop a time-varying parameter VAR with t-distributed measurement errors and stochastic volatility. To control for overparametrization, we rely on the Bayesian literature on shrinkage priors, which enables us to shrink coefficients associated with irrelevant predictors and/or perform model specification in a flexible manner. Using around one year of daily data, we perform a real-time forecasting exercise and investigate whether any of the proposed models is able to outperform the naive random walk benchmark. To assess the economic relevance of the forecasting gains produced by the proposed models we, moreover, run a simple trading exercise.","[Hotz-Behofsits, Christian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Vienna, Austria; [Huber, Florian; Zoerner, Thomas Otto] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Huber, F (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",fhuber@wu.ac.at,"Hotz-Behofsits, Christian/AAE-8008-2020","Hotz-Behofsits, Christian/0000-0003-1921-1978; Huber, Florian/0000-0002-2896-7921; Zorner, Thomas O./0000-0001-7830-7801",Czech Science Foundation [17-14263S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"Czech Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 17-14263S",,37,22,23,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

According to public sustainability discourses a combination of green growth and responsible consumers is supposed to be the best solution. This article focuses on the individual appropriation of these discourses. Based on which interpretive patterns, values and spatial relationships do food identities, attributions of responsibilities and daily practices get normalized and hence stabilized or, on the contrary, politicized and challenged? Our analysis of qualitative interviews with consumers reveals a complex and ambivalent appropriation of public sustainability discourses. On the one hand dominant patterns of the public sustainability discourses are (re-)produced. On the other hand the optimism regarding the transformative potential of responsible consumers is rejected. Furthermore, the interviewees complain about adverse circumstances that are opposed to felicitous consumption practices. The handling of daily shortcomings in meeting one's own demands is quite diverse. It ranges from attempts to stimulate other consumers to compensations by extraordinary events (in which an ideal concept of good food can be implemented) and fatalistic concessions to the constraining dominant conditions. Moreover, counter-hegemonic narratives recall the contingency of powerful structures that constantly encounter resistance and therefore always remain open for negotiations, transformations and change.","[Krueger, Timmo] Leibniz Inst Raumbezogene Sozialforsch, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany; [Struever, Anke] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS); University of Hamburg,"Krüger, T (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Raumbezogene Sozialforsch, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany.",timmo.krueger@leibniz-irs.de; anke.struever@uni-hamburg.de,,"Kruger, Timmo/0009-0007-6208-3744","Fritz Thyssen Stiftung [10.13039/501100003390, 10.15.2.030SO]",Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,"Fritz Thyssen Stiftung, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100003390, Grant Number: 10.15.2.030SO.",,45,10,10,2,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

To recover their business reputation and trust, agro-food companies are increasingly implementing corporate social responsibility (CSR) in their production processes. CSR involves the whole supply chain, and several studies on CSR in the agro-food industry have investigated consumer preferences regarding social responsibility either as a whole or in a small number of dimensions. This study, which is based on a sample of 204 Italian university students, measures consumer preferences and the willingness to pay (WTP) for eight dimensions of CSR. The respondents' WTP was evaluated in a nonhypothetical setting by using the incentive-compatible Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method. Individual human values were also detected to investigate the determinants influencing the participants' WTP. The results revealed a positive effect of social responsibility on the participants' WTP, with personal values playing a central role.","[Lerro, Marco] Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Benevento, Italy; [Caracciolo, Francesco; Vecchio, Riccardo; Cembalo, Luigi] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, AgEcon & Policy Grp, Naples, Italy",University of Sannio; University of Naples Federico II,"Lerro, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Benevento, Italy.",marco.lerro@unisannio.it; francesco.caracciolo@unina.it; riccardo.vecchio@unina.it; cembalo@unina.it,"Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013; Vecchio, Riccardo/I-8357-2012","Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529; Vecchio, Riccardo/0000-0003-2790-597X; Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797",,,,,87,18,19,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

This workshop focused on collaboration between public and private organisations as a key dimension of public transport governance. Collaborative arrangements can in some cases be a complementary approach to owner-instruction relationships (when allowed within the legal framework), overcoming or at least addressing some of the critical interfaces and problems that fall between the cracks in formal institutional structures. Collaboration between organisations with different resources and aims is often crucial for the ability to identify, develop and implement efficient solutions to problems that exceed traditional divisions of responsibility. It can foster trust (trusting partnerships) and joint capacity for innovation; and it can take place in formalized partnerships or more informal networks. Papers at the workshop addressed both positive and negative experiences of collaboration in Scandinavia, Brasil, Chile, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Australia from an empirical perspective, but several more theoretical papers considered the place of collaboration within wider governance frameworks. The workshop discussions led to a clearer definition of collaboration, and the formulation of key lessons on collaboration as a critical dimension in the interaction between the organisations that drive the development of current public transport operations and management, and future public transport improvements.","[Rye, Tom] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Isaksson, Karolina] VTI, Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Div Mobil Actors & Planning Proc, Stockholm, Sweden; [Isaksson, Karolina] Royal Inst Technol, KTH, Div Urban & Reg Studies, Stockholm, Sweden",Edinburgh Napier University; VTI; Royal Institute of Technology,"Rye, T (通讯作者)，Edinburgh Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",t.rye@napier.ac.uk; karolina.isaksson@vti.se,,,"Vinnova; Swedish Innovation Agency; K2, the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport","Vinnova(Vinnova); Swedish Innovation Agency(Vinnova); K2, the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport","We are indebted to all participants who contributed actively to the workshop discussions.

Characteristics of innovation were hypothesised to be key factors influencing customers' intention to use self-collection services. Demographic characteristics were also tested. Survey data were collected from 164 consumers located in Singapore and analysed using hierarchical regression analysis. The results show that among the five key characteristics of innovation, relative advantage, compatibility and trialability positively influence customers' intention to use self-collection services. It is also found that the pre-eminent step to improve customers' intention is to integrate self-collection into consumers' lifestyle, values and needs. In addition, self-collection services should be marketed in a manner that confers a clear advantage over other last-mile delivery methods. This paper enriches the literature on IDT as well as the management and design of self-collection services for last-mile delivery.","[Yuen, Kum Fai] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, Seoul, South Korea; [Wang, Xueqin; Li Ting Wendy Ng; Wong, Yiik Diew] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Chung Ang University; Nanyang Technological University,"Wang, XQ (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore.",wang1072@e.ntu.edu.sg,"Yuen, Kum Fai/K-2994-2019; WONG, Y.

Applying a piecewise-constant exponential proportional hazard model with a particular focus on the impact of internal and external time-varying determinants, we find that firms show a higher probability to leave a cartel if prior exits occurred as well as in periods of high demand growth. However, we find a lower exit probability in situations of prior entries to the cartel or in periods of high interest rates, Additional estimations at the cartel level further suggest that firm exits increase the probability of a cartel breakdown substantially.

The survey was conducted in four urban areas in England. Participants were asked whether they would cross a road without designated crossing facilities in order to access a cheaper shop or a bus stop on the other side of the road, instead of a more expensive one on their side of the road. This method provides information for the inclusion of severance effects in the appraisal of interventions to change road design and to control motorised traffic. The estimated value per walking trip of reducing the number of vehicle lanes from 3 to 2 and from 2 to 1 is 1.28 pound and 1.00 pound respectively. The value of adding a central reservation (median strip) is 1.08 pound. The value of reducing traffic levels from medium to low and from high to medium is 0.76 pound and 1.08 pound respectively The value of reducing speed limits below 30mph is 0.45 pound. These values depend on age, gender, disability, health condition, mobility restrictions, qualifications, location, and walking behaviour.","[Anciaes, Paulo Rui; Jones, Peter] UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Chadwick Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Metcalfe, Paul James] PJM Econ, 1 Walford Close, Wimborne BH21 1PH, England",University of London; University College London,"Anciaes, PR (通讯作者)，UCL, Ctr Transport Studies, Chadwick Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",p.anciaes@ucl.ac.uk; peter.jones@ucl.ac.uk; paul@pjmeconomics.co.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; Arts and Humanities Research Council [EP/K037323/1]; EPSRC [EP/K037323/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This paper is an output from the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility project, which is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, and Arts and Humanities Research Council (Grant EP/K037323/1).

For credit card services, this restraint takes the form of a no-surcharge rule: the credit card company prohibits the retailer from surcharging transactions using the company's card. This article develops a theory of vMFN restraints and applies it to credit cards. The vMFN clause harms competition among upstream suppliers, which raises price to a level even greater than the monopoly price. The vMFN clause can also be used to extract surplus from customers of products supplied competitively. Applying the theory to credit card antitrust cases, we find that the two-sided nature of the market does not mandate a new set of competition policy principles, contrary to the decision in Ohio v. American Express. Indeed, the economic literature on credit card networks as two-sided platforms rediscovers established principles of price theory.","[Carlton, Dennis W.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Winter, Ralph A.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Chicago; University of British Columbia,"Carlton, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,23,8,9,1,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Against this background many countries of the Global South founded new, or liberalised existing, stock exchanges, albeit with different results. Whereas in various Asian countries these markets have attracted sizable amounts of investment capital for domestic companies, this is not the case for most stock exchanges in Africa and especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Although there is an increasing number of Sub-Saharan African stock exchanges, the majority is institutionally weak, small, illiquid and thus unattractive to most international investors, resulting in low portfolio investment inflows to Sub-Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, Africa is becoming increasingly portrayed as continent of opportunities with immense growth prospects which led to a new and growing appetite for investment in Africa in general and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular. In this situation the new UN-supported Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSEI) comes into play which aims at transforming stock markets into instruments for supporting sustainable development and green growth. Based on conceptual considerations surrounding the development-through-stock-exchanges argument, this exploratory research addresses the actors involved in this initiative and takes their rationales under closer scrutiny. We argue that the initiative not only serves as a tool for sustainable development, but also as a promoter and facilitator of new international investment opportunities, specifically for international and institutional investors in their drive to enlarge and diversify their portfolios - resulting in various challenges for Sub-Saharan stock exchanges and their local stakeholders.","[Klagge, Britta] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Zademach, Hans-Martin] Katholische Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Fachbereich Geog, Ostenstr 18, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany",University of Bonn,"Klagge, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",klagge@uni-bonn.de,,"Zademach, Hans-Martin/0000-0001-9927-6311",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the newly established collaborative research center Future Rural Africa [CRC228],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the newly established collaborative research center Future Rural Africa,"The authors acknowledge helpful comments on earlier versions of the paper from the participants of the Financial Geography Lab at the Frankfurt School in November 2017, particularly Ewa Karwowski and Eike Schamp who also gave detailed written comments, and two very constructive and inspiring anonymous reviews.

Modeling household location choice is complicated by the many influencing factors involved. This modeling, as far as we know, until recently, has been mostly static in the sense that models have been estimated on data from one point in time. This paper takes advantage of microdata on movers from three Canadian censuses in Montreal to estimate household location choice models in a dynamic context, with the aim of understanding if, and how, the influencing factors are evolving through time. That is, the parameters are assumed to be functions of time by testing different functional forms for expressing parameter changes. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation across neighborhoods is included in the model. The results show a significant improvement when accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, the appropriate distance threshold to incorporate surrounding tracts in spatial autocorrelation calculations is examined and also it is found that there is no significant autocorrelation between neighborhoods located farther than 800 m from each other. Finally, over time, household sensitivity toward a number influencing variables is observed to have changed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To address these fears, the European Union passed the Privacy Directive to regulate the common business practice of information collection. This paper investigates the potential effects of this regulation, finding that the law is likely to generate several unintended consequences. Economists and legal scholars acknowledge that personal data serves as the price for accessing many digital platforms. I extend this logic to argue that if a regulation enables consumers to stop supplying this information, while continuing to consume the site's content, it is equivalent to a price control. Next, I discuss unintended consequences that this price control may generate: tie-in sales, investment flight, and altered exchange characteristics. Lastly, I conclude that, just as with traditional price controls, the privacy price control may be a way for government officials to enhance their popularity with the citizenry. In short, my analysis suggests that one of the most well-researched policy interests of economics-the theory of price controls-can shed light on one of economists' newest interests: digital privacy.","[Fuller, Caleb S.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Mason Hall,1st Floor,MSN 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Fuller, CS (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Mason Hall,1st Floor,MSN 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",cfuller5@gmu.edu,"Fuller, Caleb S./GOP-1010-2022","Fuller, Caleb S./0000-0001-7659-5547",Mercatus Center,Mercatus Center,I wish to thank the Mercatus Center for their summer 2016 financial support which enabled me to begin this project.,,77,3,3,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

There are several significant reasons why even a skeptic of the ITC's Anti-dumping, Countervailing Duty, and Safeguards docket (collectively, the Title VII docket)-as well as an antitrust skeptic-should be significantly less worried when cases normally expected to be brought in the Title VII portion of the ITC's docket as petitions are instead brought in the Section 337 portion of the ITC docket as complaints alleging ordinary violations of the antitrust laws. Private antitrust litigation fits with the plain meaning of the ITC's statute and with well-established antitrust case law. The ITC 337 docket also offers some practical benefits over courts and other agencies. The procedures do not rely heavily administrative deference; and do rely heavily on the full panoply of procedural devices ordinarily available in court for truth-testing of evidence including cross examination, all in a timeframe likely to be significantly shorter (around 18 months) than the many years typically required for antitrust litigation in federal court, and without the black box of a general jury verdict. What about the doctrine that federal courts developed called antitrust injury? The ITC relied on that doctrine to dismiss a case recently brought by the domestic U.S. steel industry against. Chinese importers of steel. This paper explores some reasons why that doctrine does not fit the ITC 337 statute.","[Kieff, F.

We examine the sensitivity of the simulated effects to assumptions with regard to the firms' forward commitments. The wholesale market effects of these transactions depend critically on firms' forward commitments.

COBIT and ITIL, among other frameworks, can be considered for the implementation of IT governance. This work uncovers which frameworks and related standards have been adopted to implement the governance of IT at universities. Using a qualitative approach, interviews were carried out with IT directors at universities in three countries: Brazil, Portugal, and the Netherlands. Findings reveal that ITIL is the most used framework with Service Desk and Incident Management as the most implemented processes in the six universities under study. While the Brazilian and the Portuguese universities have adopted ITIL, the Dutch universities preferred to adopt BiSL. Something similar happens for IT project management with Brazilian and Portuguese universities adopting PMBOK while Dutch universities have adopted PRINCE2. Something that is common to all universities under study, it is the option for IS0:27001 regarding information security. Overall, it seems that IT at universities is still focused on operational and managerial issues.

The second one was comprehensive (extensive) survey and was performed on a sample of 2,626 respondents - employees and managers of Slovak organizations. Compared to a comprehensive survey conducted on both production and non-production organizations, a survey performed at the University confirmed the relatively lower managerial erudition of senior staff and, in particular, a different view of managers and employees on motivate employees. Managers at University in many respects have higher expectations of the outcome of their decisions in motivate than their actual effectiveness really is. Our survey shows that, despite the difficult situation in higher education, executives and staff are still keen to increase their motivation to achieve better performance and thus improve the University results. For this reason, the final part provides recommendations for the implementation of better decision making on motivate.","[Blaskova, Martina] Univ Zilina, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Polackova, Kristina] Avast As, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Blasková, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",blaskova@fri.uniza.sk; kristina.trskova@gmail.com,"Blaskova, Martina/AAH-6338-2020; Blašková, Martina/ABF-3732-2021",,[KEGA 041ZU-4/2017],,Paper was conducted within the project KEGA 041ZU-4/2017 Experimental Mathematics Accessible for All.,,15,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2281-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,33,42,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2HN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505804100004,0

Our identification strategy relies on instrumental variables and recently proposed heteroskedasticity-based instruments. Additionally, we perform sensitivity analysis to account for omitted variables bias. The main results of our study can be summed up in three points. First, it highlights the contrasting effects of R&D and offshoring as wage determinants. Second, it shows that external demand is a key variable driving profits growth. Third, the categorisation of workers according to skill level shows that high-skilled workers are favoured by both innovation and offshoring, offshoring exerts downward pressure primarily on low-skilled wages and profits are positively correlated with high-skill wages, negatively correlated with medium-skill wages and not correlated with low-skill wages.","[Bogliacino, Francesco] Univ Nacl Colombia, Escuela Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Guarascio, Dario] Ist Nazl Anal Polit Pubbl INAPP Roma, Rome, Italy; [Cirillo, Valeria] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Ist Econ, Pisa, Italy",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Bogliacino, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Colombia, Escuela Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ, Bogota, Colombia.",fbogliacino@unal.edu.co,"Guarascio, Dario/AAF-4189-2019","Guarascio, Dario/0000-0002-2748-6472; Bogliacino, Francesco/0000-0001-8874-8846; Cirillo, Valeria/0000-0003-4562-2359",,,,,126,16,16,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This idea of economic and social cohesion is explicitly mentioned in the founding texts of the European Union, but the progress in its implementing is very sluggish. Since the Lisbon Treaty, this cohesion has a territorial dimension. However, regional disparities persist and they are sometimes exploited for electoral purposes to fuel anti-European rhetoric. It is important to remember the steps that have marked the desire to establish territorial cohesion in Europe, the great progress that has been made and the progress that remains to be made.

It provides people with opportunities for employment, social activities and involvement in the community. In recant times, many transport agencies are investing in their public transport systems to transform them into an integrated system. However, despite some advancement in this area, the understanding of public transport users' perceptions and how this aligns with policy makers' perceptions of an integrated system is limited. This understanding is critical to attract more commuters to use public transport. This paper conducted an analytical comparison between the users' and policy makers' perception of the various attributes that are used to develop an integrated system. A regional plan, produced in Auckland, New Zealand to implement an integrated system, was used as a case study. User-preference surveys and semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data. Data analysis was performed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the relative weight of the various attributes. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups of public transport users with similar characteristics. The findings provide the similarities and differences in users' and policy makers' perception of the attributes used to create an integrated system. Future research will investigate the needs of disadvantaged users such as elderly and disabled people, to understand how they are met by an integrated system.","[Chowdhury, Subeh; Gonzalez, Vicente A.; Schot, Bart] Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Auckland, New Zealand; [Hadas, Yuval] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Management, Max Ve Anna Webb St, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",University of Auckland; Bar Ilan University,"Chowdhury, S (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Auckland, New Zealand.",s.chowdhury@auckland.ac.nz; yuval.hadas@biu.ac.il; v.gonzalez@auckland.ac.nz; b.schot@st.hanze.nl,"Hadas, Yuval/Q-3256-2017","Chowdhury, Subeh/0000-0002-9619-705X",,,,,46,61,66,5,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

In response to this concern, some mechanisms and procedures have been developed and applied that allow the integration of strategic and financial analyzes at the level of strategic investment decision making Examining a particular case study of a company of the automotive industry, this paper sought to understand to what extent the strategic analysis influences and relates to the business investment policy of the company.

Hence, it is necessary to have enterprise systems at a reasonable level of business intelligence to provide an environment suitable for supporting decision makers through aggregation and analysis of data in their database. Therefore, this study provides a novel assessment framework of BI for enterprise systems, by extending of CODAS method with interval-valued intuitive fuzzy sets. The CODAS is a new method for multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems. In the proposed model, a number of 34 criteria from the most important BI indexes are identified and, accordingly, five enterprise systems are evaluated through expert discussions. The results reveal that the most important assessment criteria defined by expert panels include visual graph display, dashboard design, capable of data storage, meeting stakeholder needs, and the possibility for detailed realistic analysis. Then, one alternative is defined as the final selection which provides an outstanding performance on the criteria of groupware programs, group decision-making tools, training techniques, data transfer capability, knowledge inference, supporting fuzzy concepts under ambiguity and uncertainty, real-time analytical processing, managing email channels, and achieving stakeholder satisfaction. The results obtained from the extended method are compared with three different ranking techniques. And, the analysis of correlation coefficients confirms similarity between this solution and such methods as COPRAS-IVIF and MABAC-IVIF.","[Dahooei, Jalil Heidary; Vanaki, Amir Salar; Firoozfar, Hamid Reza] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Dahooei, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran.",heidaryd@ut.ac.ir; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; amirsalarvanaki@ut.ac.ir; hmdfiroozfar@ut.ac.ir; m.keshavarz_gh@yahoo.com,"Dahooie, Jalil Heidary/AAF-6992-2022; Dahooie, Jalil Heidary/ADE-7571-2022; Firoozfar, Hamid Reza/ABG-8915-2021; Firoozfar, Hamid Reza/L-7580-2019; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/J-5488-2014; Firoozfar, Hamid/HME-2009-2023; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Dahooie, Jalil Heidary/0000-0003-4037-6670; Dahooie, Jalil Heidary/0000-0003-4037-6670; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/0000-0002-0362-1633; Vanaki, Amirsalar/0000-0002-2667-6231; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Firoozfar, Hamid Reza/0000-0002-2722-8764",,,,,36,16,16,3,28,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

These countries were considered to reflect farm communities in Central and Eastern European and other similar countries. The study revealed that the dairy farmers in the participating countries still are production oriented as they most often choose expanding dairy production and further specialization in dairy farming as their preferred farm strategies for the upcoming five years. Farmers with higher competence levels were more inclined to change, were more positive about their future, had larger farms, and were more content with their family income and farm results.

But what happens at the micro level? By building on key indicators of economic development and a national public opinion survey implemented at the end of 2017, our paper demonstrates Romanian citizens do not appear to perceive any correlation between the accession to the EU or, better said, between the poor capitalization of EU membership, on the one hand, and the raising internal and external gaps, on the other one.

The low birth rate in the Czech Republic is one of the reasons for finding alternative ways to reform the pension system. In recent years, governments in the Czech Republic have been looking for measures to support parents within existing tax and social systems. Recently, the Expert Panel on Pension Reform has proposed the possibility of differentiating the amount of the pension premium depending on the number of children raised.

Therefore, an approach which deals with the most threatened groups of citizens prevails. The study concludes that compared to the USA, where various approaches and accents are used, in Central Europe the sociological approach is dominant, which has crucial consequences for policy-making.

They also organise these kinds of lease (rent) contracts on a single legal basis, as defined in Art. 58 of the Civil Code of Ukraine. In practice, the general conditions of lease form statutory basis of regulating the leasing relationship for which the law does not set features of signing and implementation of the contract Doctrinal approaches and position of the higher courts to economic criteria and harmonisation of civil law in the regulation of rent relations have been defined Based on semantic analysis of the provisions of Art. 5(30) of the Economic Code of Ukraine, two groups of the of features of regulation of relations were distinguished. The first group consists of provisions that determine the characteristics of the lease as a whole. The second group contains the rules that set features of lease in state and municipal property.

Contrary to online advertising available on social media where traditional advertising logic provides an adequate explanation, the content creation and dialogue on social networks still lack sufficient understanding. Consequently, there are many companies which tend to misunderstand customers communication needs within the social media landscape. The obvious reason is the lack of knowledge combined with resistance to change. To bridge this gap, there is a need for empirical research which will clarify the current communication needs of customers. To explore this phenomenon, exploratory research employing questionnaire involving 481 respondents was evaluated with factor analysis method. Identification of three factors provided deeper insights into the understanding of attitudes and behaviour of the current internet population in the Czech Republic. Social network Facebook was chosen as the most widespread not only locally but also globally. Based on this research and previous research studies on communication, a new communication model is proposed in which the element of interaction is the most important. The proposed scheme bears some novel aspects. Firstly, the content in our model is not created outside as in previous models. A social network itself provides a platform for content creation. Secondly, we expanded the physical technical environment of the social network by the abstract brand community in which not only customers but the employees form a vital part. Lastly, the data plays an important role as a valuable tool for feedback and further analysis. Data flow from customer to company enables managers to execute true mass individualisation.","[Klepek, Martin; Starzyczna, Halina] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Business Econ & Management, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Klepek, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Business Econ & Management, Opava, Czech Republic.",klepek@opf.slu.cz,"Klepek, Martin/AAJ-7774-2021; Klepek, Martin/AAB-6743-2022; Starzyczná, Halina/HKM-7864-2023","Klepek, Martin/0000-0003-4058-156X; Klepek, Martin/0000-0003-4058-156X;",Student grant competition project Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools [SGS/7/2017],Student grant competition project Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools,This research was financially supported by the Student grant competition project SGS/7/2017: Acceptance of technology from the perspective of marketing tools.,,59,9,11,13,99,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The project encompasses two main components: the 'Economic Belt' (on land) and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' (on sea). The scale of the project is impressive in terms of the number of its potential participants and the funds it is planned to invest approximately 2.2 trillion US dollars by 2025. Transit countries on the way of Chinese goods to Europe are eager to benefit from the lucrative spillover effects of the 'Silk Road' project. This paper focuses on the potential of the Northern Sea Route in the context of the 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and analyzes the official data provided by the Russian and Chinese government. The author demonstrates that the route's inclusion in the project will be beneficial both for China and for Russia as it will offer cargo ships a safer and faster passage, provide opportunities for establishing the all-year connection with remote areas, development of eco-tourism and transportation of raw materials.

Financial statements are usually prepared in a PDF format for external users. Financial statements prepared by thirty selected Russian companies have been analysed. It has been defined that the format of the financial statements prepared in line with Russian Accounting Standards does not have any individualisation. This can be explained by unification of its taxonomy. Though, statements prepared in line with the IFRS by the same companies are characterised by the individuality of their taxonomy. Visual focus on text and digital information presentation of statements is made for external users. One of the conclusions of this research has revealed that reports prepared in line with IFRS in XBRL format can be characterised by a high degree of the taxonomy standardisation. Hence, it leads to decrease in reporting individualisation. Transition to XBRL format changes approach of how financial information is being perceived. It transforms the static text of the formatted statements into interactive information. For the companies that work under the jurisdictions where the transition to XBRL format has already started, there are additional requirements in order to convert the statements into electronic format and keep the individuality of the taxonomy in financial statements prepared in line with IFRS. It has been concluded that XBRL format can lead to global standardisation of taxonomy on the international arena in future. Meaning that an automatic translation into any language can easily be done and all the stakeholders can access the information. Transition to XBRL format affects all the user groups within a company as well as externally, between the companies, controlling institutions and regulators. Unified data preparation will provide all the users of the statements prepared in line with IFRS with operational, reliable and high quality data.","[Lehoux, Liubov] MIA TI, CP A, Geneva, Switzerland; [Morozova, Tatyana Viktorovna; Safonova, Emiliya Gennadyevna; Kalacheva, Olga Nikolayevna] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ Moscow, Dept Accounting & Taxat, Moscow, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,"Lehoux, L (通讯作者)，MIA TI, CP A, Geneva, Switzerland.",liubovlehoux@gmail.com; isfyr@mail.ru; emely_saf@mail.ru; olgaklchv@rambler.ru,"Tarasova (Kalacheva), Olga Nikolaevna/AAD-7525-2020; Morozova, Tatiana/K-3355-2018","Tarasova (Kalacheva), Olga Nikolaevna/0000-0001-6089-0939; Morozova, Tatiana/0000-0003-3833-2783; Lehoux, Liubov/0000-0001-6081-5808",,,,,15,8,8,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2048,2055,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203013,0

To date, the ability of this ambitious conceptual model to thereby explain economic geography has remained largely untested beyond the select industry networks examined by its proponents, most notably the electronics, retail, and automotive sectors of East Asia. In this article, we stress test the causative model for the case of lead firms in the global cocoa-chocolate sector, and assess its ability to subsequently explain industry configurations and territorial outcomes in a particular country: Indonesia. Our application suggests that GPN 2.0 has considerable utility for directing empirical research, but challenges beset its fuller theoretical promise. We identify a problematic relationship between the deductive causality implied by GPN 2.0 and the inherent relationality of GPN 1.0 that remains, in our view, unresolved. As a result, we remain skeptical of the broader theoretical claims that GPN 2.0 possesses explanatory powers capable of deducing industry network configurations from a discrete set of supposedly independent variables.","[Neilson, Jeff; Pritchard, Bill] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Fold, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Geog, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dwiartama, Angga] Bandung Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",University of Sydney; University of Copenhagen; Institute Technology of Bandung,"Neilson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",jeffrey.neilson@sydney.edu.au; bill.pritchard@sydney.edu.au; nf@geogr.ku.dk; dwiartama@sith.itb.ac.id,"Fold, Niels/E-2776-2015","Fold, Niels/0000-0002-1133-6525; Pritchard, Bill/0000-0001-7506-2095; Neilson, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2560-2190; Dwiartama, Angga/0000-0003-4924-1449","Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government) [AGB-2010-099]; Sydney Southeast Asia Centre (University of Sydney)","Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government); Sydney Southeast Asia Centre (University of Sydney)","We would like to thank the four anonymous reviewers of the article, all of whom provided input that helped improve the final version of the article.

However, team evaluation and assessment received much less attention. In this paper, an application of the fuzzy logic is proposed to predict team performance according to fuzzy inference models. As a novelty in this study, we estimate that a teamwork performance is to be likely assimilated to a fuzzy system attitude.

It moves the concept of time compression diseconomies beyond the firm level to cities, and hopes to investigate how technological upgrading in one region is influenced by the FDI expansion process. Based on the panel data set of 244 Chinese cities over 2004-2011, our results illustrate that irregular and unpredictable foreign expansions significantly diminish FDI spillovers in Chinese cities, and it also directly impedes technological upgrading in local area. Rapid foreign expansion process itself impedes technological upgrading, but it significantly enhances technology transfers and disseminations of FDI in Chinese cities.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lack knowledge-based resources, because of limited business history, experience, and budgets. The effects of entrepreneurial orientation and CSV are examined from a resource-based view. Empirical evidence of the moderating effect of CSV and learning orientation on firm performance is lacking, especially in SMEs in South Korea. We collected 300 samples from SMEs, and analysed the data using quantile regression, which explores the effects of covariates at various quantile levels of a conditional distribution. This differs from previous studies on SMEs, which dealt with the conditional mean (ordinary least squares). The results confirm the significant and positive effects of CSV orientation on firm performance and that entrepreneurial orientation and the moderating effects of learning and CSV orientation are more effective for firms in the mid to upper quantiles in terms of performance. We also examined whether the effects of entrepreneurial and CSV orientation differ for firms with low and high performance using quantile regression. The results indicate that strategic orientations need to be different in low and high-performing businesses. The results address the heterogeneity of SME performance in strategic orientation analyses.","[Park, Sang Il] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Div Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Seo, Joo Hwan] Dong A Univ, Sch Business, Busan, South Korea",Sookmyung Women's University; Dong A University,"Seo, JH (通讯作者)，Dong A Univ, Sch Business, Mkt Div, Business Hall 1019,Seogu Boomin Dong 2ga, Busan 49236, South Korea.",joohwans@dau.ac.kr,,,Entrepreneurship Research Program through the Sookmyung Women's University Entrepreneurship Center (SEC) - Small and Medium Business Administration University Entrepreneurial Center,Entrepreneurship Research Program through the Sookmyung Women's University Entrepreneurship Center (SEC) - Small and Medium Business Administration University Entrepreneurial Center,This research was supported by Entrepreneurship Research Program through the Sookmyung Women's University Entrepreneurship Center (SEC) funded by the Small and Medium Business Administration University Entrepreneurial Center in 2014.,,52,3,4,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The measures were initially selected under local stakeholder consultation under the Waste Roadmap of Cabo Verde project development, as well as all technical assumptions. The analysis was developed using the GACMO model, to build a marginal revenue abatement curve. The waste composting solution for large producers presents the largest volume of GHG emissions saved, 81 ktCO(2)eq./year, at a low cost of 0.62 US$/tCO(2)eq., thus supporting its implementation. In complement, the landfill gas electricity production shows positive yields of 40 US$/tCO(2)eq., with savings of about 36ktCO(2)eq. per year, contributing to the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of the country. The landfill gas flaring solution shows higher costs since it does not benefit from electricity generation.

The results obtained are useful for the agricultural sector and for the business environment.","[Stoica (Dinca), Cristina; Bacanu (Serban), Constanta; Dumitriu (Ion), Iuliana Manuela; Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Stoica, C (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",dincacristina2007@yahoo.com; serbancing@yahoo.com; iuliana.ion12@yahoo.com; sstanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5369,5377,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206039,0

Empirical findings reveal that innovation is as the topmost criteria, which is more important rather than proactive and risk-taking in doing the business operation.

Ironically, among the most lucid exposition of the main thrust of socialist economic policies can be found not in economic studies, but in the general history of the Romanians, written by Vlad Georgescu (Georgescu, 1991[19841). The main element which usual discussions of the period miss is the idea that under the apparent orderly planned economy, there laid in fact a planned chaos, a waste of resources on a colossal scale (Mises, 1981[19221). Essential for understanding this aspect is the argument of the impossibility of economic calculation under state ownership of the means of production (Mises, 1990[19201). After reiterating Mises's argument, we will use it to criticize some recent re-evaluations of Romania's socialist experience. Then, we will provide three case studies to illustrate how the allocative chaos manifests itself in practice.","[Topan, Mihai Vladimir; Paun, Cristian Valeriu; Stamate-Stefan, Andreas; Apavaloaei, Matei-Alexandru] Bucharest Univ Econ Studie, Fac Int Business & Econ, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Topan, MV (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studie, Fac Int Business & Econ, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",mihai.topan@rei.ase.ro; cpaun@ase.ro; andreas.stamate@reisase.ro; apavaloaei_matei@yahoo.co.uk,"Paun, Cristian/I-5609-2016; Topan, Mihai Vladimir/AAY-9149-2020","Paun, Cristian/0000-0002-5057-3750; Topan, Mihai Vladimir/0000-0002-1011-8737",,,,,45,1,1,0,2,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The findings of this study show that besides entrepreneurs' strong sense of passion for the unique songket art, constant support by the government has been the main factor which contributes to the success of the cottage-based songket industry in Malaysia.

Aim and setting: A review of accounting research in internationalising journals in the South African region that publish accounting research. Methods: The characteristics of accounting articles were analysed. Five journals were analysed, including the four internationalising journals, Investment Analysts Journal, Meditari Accountancy Research, South African Journal of Business Management, and South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences and one local journal, South African Journal of Accounting Research (SAJAR). Results: The findings of this study will be of interest to journal editors, authors who would like their research to make an impact and be cited, as well as university research administrators and government higher education policy-makers. Conclusion: The analyses show that many of the highly cited articles have been published recently, boding well for the citation statistics of these journals in future and indicating some success in their efforts to internationalise. The citations of SAJAR lag behind the citations of the internationalising journals. Each journal publishes articles that cover different subject area(s). Within accounting research, accounting education and social and environmental accounting are popular areas of research, whereas taxation; the public sector; and management accounting are not well represented among published articles during 2015-2016 in these five journals. About half of all accounting articles claim their insights will contribute to the accounting literature, with much smaller percentages claiming to contribute to management, policy-making and practice. The most prolific authors and most prominent universities to some extent follow the most popular subject areas, with a social and environmental researcher, Warren Maroun, featuring strongly, and his university, the University of the Witwatersrand, being prominent. Large proportions of authors of 2015-2016 articles are from outside of Africa, speaking to the success of the internationalisation efforts of the internationalising journals, whereas SAJAR mostly publishes articles by African authors.","[de Villiers, Charl J.; Hsiao, Pei-Chi K.] Univ Auckland, Fac Business & Econ, Grad Sch Management, Auckland, New Zealand; [de Villiers, Charl J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Auckland; University of Pretoria,"de Villiers, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Fac Business & Econ, Grad Sch Management, Auckland, New Zealand.;de Villiers, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa.",charl.devilliers@auckland.ac.nz,"de Villiers, Charl/G-1334-2019; Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023; Hsiao, Pei-Chi Kelly/G-3120-2017","Hsiao, Pei-Chi Kelly/0000-0003-3482-3745",,,,,170,4,4,5,27,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, no existing data set allows an explicit investigation of the relationship between marriage and economic development. In this paper, we construct new cross-country panel data on marital statistics for 16 OECD countries from 1900 to 2000, in order to analyze such a relationship. We use this data set, together with cross-country data on real GDP per capita and the value added share of agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors, to document two novel stylized facts. First, the fraction of a country's population that is married displays a hump-shaped relationship with the level of real GDP per capita. Second, the fraction of the married correlates positively with the share of manufacturing in GDP. We conclude that the stage of economic development of a country is a key factor that affects individuals' family formation decisions.","[Moro, Alessio] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; [Moslehi, Solmaz] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Tanaka, Satoshi] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Tanaka, Satoshi] CAMA, Garbagnate Monastero, Italy",University of Cagliari; Monash University; University of Queensland,"Moro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Via St Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.",amoro@unica.it,,,,,,,43,3,3,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

While the accumulated empirical evidence concerning the drivers of port efficiency is large, there has not been any attempt at systematically assessing the causes of (in)efficiency through quantitative meta-analysis. This study therefore uses a compounded dataset of port efficiency estimates from 52 studies and regresses these estimates on port and country characteristics, while controlling for study-specific and methodological effects. Surveying the literature, we find that there is a lack of attention paid to the user side of port service production, which has crucial implications for the interpretation of efficiency estimates. At the cross-country level, we find a negative relationship between GDP per capita and estimated port efficiency, as well as a negative relationship between intra-port competition and estimated efficiency. We discuss the interpretation of these findings in the context of partial production functions, and argue that a large portion of the applied methods do not capture substitution between producer and user inputs. We also find that the ratio of military spending to GDP is positively related to estimated port efficiency, while a higher degree of product concentration in trade flows is associated with lower levels of estimated efficiency.","[Merkel, Axel; Holmgren, Johan] Specialized Univ Logist, Molde Univ Coll, Fac Logist, Molde, Norway",Molde University College,"Merkel, M (通讯作者)，Molde Univ Coll, POB 2110, NO-6402 Molde, Norway.",axel.p.merkel@himolde.no,,"Holmgren, Johan/0000-0002-2566-4183; Merkel, Axel/0000-0001-6347-8827",,,,,98,24,24,5,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

I decompose the observed weekend effect into the effects from these two factors. To this end, I estimate a viewer choice model that uses aggregate Nielsen ratings data for prime-time network television shows over 11 years. The long span of the data enables me to control for television series qualities. The estimation results reveal that the estimated weekend effect is dampened as the empirical model accounts for variation in the program quality compositions. The counterfactual analysis that is based on the estimates of the preferred specification indicates that endogenous scheduling accounts for two-thirds of the rating drops on weekends.","[Yeo, Jungwon] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Yeo, J (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",jwyeo@smu.edu.sg,"YEO, Jungwon/D-1454-2009",,,,,,16,2,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

However, traffic congestion is a pervasive problem in cities and a tax is seldom applied. Why? To answer this question, we estimate and simulate the welfare and traffic effects of a congestion tax and a licence plate restriction - a less attractive policy for economists, but far more used in practice. The tax performs better on aggregate. However, while the tax spreads its burden more evenly across the population, the restriction concentrates losses on a smaller group, and has little effect on the rich. These results support both a majority voting and an 'elite capture' argument in favour of the licence plate restriction.","[Lucinda, Claudio R.] Univ Sao Paulo Ribeirao Preto, Av Bandeirantes 3900, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [Moita, Rodrigo M.

We identify internal and external contingencies that have significantly impacted the development trajectory of pyrotechnic production in Tultepec, Mexico, giving rise to governance dynamics characterised by a lack of co-ordination among local producer associations. Consequently, the main local institutional arrangements are controlled by particular interest groups. This limits the participation of local actors in defining national regulations relating to pyrotechnic production, resulting in a vertical/centralised law mainly defined by the state. We argue that improving the governance of the pyrotechnic productive system in Tultepec requires the co-ordination of private and public actors at different territorial scales, in order to build up an inclusive regulatory framework which can take into consideration the diversity of local producers.","[Rosales Ortega, Rocio] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Ave San Rafael Atlixco 186, Col Vicentina 09340, Iztapalapa, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Ortega, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Ave San Rafael Atlixco 186, Col Vicentina 09340, Iztapalapa, Mexico.",victoraztyan@gmail.com; rro@xanum.uam.mx,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

These scenarios are intended to cover a range of potential agreements between the UK and the EU.

The paper concludes that construction, human health and other service sectors are the most suitable sectors for electric mobility because many vehicles are registered in these sectors and daily mileage is reasonably low. They should be primary target groups of specific policy measures to promote the use of electric vehicles. Both Denmark and Germany have incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles. Nevertheless, electric vehicles do generally not show economic benefits unless travel distance is high. However, today the travel range of large vans is an important barrier for electrification due to battery weight and the limitation of 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight for driving with a normal driving licence. The rule needs amendments for electric vehicles, as has been done in Germany. The paper recommends EU countries follow the German rule allowing EVs up to 4.25 tonnes to be driven with a class B licence, thereby potentially creating a market for big vans with long travel range.

In the contracting stage, the operating cost is unknown. The firm can increase the likelihood of facing a low cost, rather than a high cost, by exerting costly effort when building the infrastructure. Once the infrastructure is in place, the firm learns the true cost and begins to operate. Under limited commitment, either partner may renege on the contract at any moment thereafter. The novelty with respect to incentive theory is that the contractual length is stipulated in the contract in such a way that it depends on the cost realization. Our main result is that, if the break-up of the partnership is sufficiently costly to the government and/or adverse selection and moral hazard are sufficiently severe, then the efficient contract is not robust to renegotiation unless it has a longer duration when the realized cost is low. This result is at odds with the literature on flexible-term contracts, which recommends a longer duration when operating conditions are unfavorable, yet, with regard to a different setting, where the demand is uncertain and the cash-flow is exogenous.","[Danau, Daniel] Univ Caen Normandie, Ctr Rech Econ & Management, Caen, France; [Vinella, Annalisa] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Metodi Matemat, Bari, Italy",Universite de Caen Normandie; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Danau, D (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Normandie, Ctr Rech Econ & Management, Caen, France.",daniel.danau@unicaen.fr; annalisa.vinella@uniba.it,,"Vinella, Annalisa/0000-0002-2602-3089",,,,,30,4,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

China's competition policy, and particularly its antimonopoly law, does not explicitly instruct with respect to the enforcement approach (per se versus rule of reason) toward vertical restraints. But from an overview of China's recent antitrust cases, we find that there is a division in the approaches taken by public versus private enforcement: Even though the administrative enforcement is more inclined to the application of per se prohibitions (or the application of the EU-style prohibition-plus-exemption approach), it seems that a rule of reason is the (increasingly) prevailing approach that is taken by the courts.","[Liu, Zhiyong] Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, 30 N 7th St, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Liu, Zhiyong] Indiana State Univ, Networks Financial Inst, 30 N 7th St, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Qiao, Yue] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shan Da Nan Lu, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Yue] Shandong Univ, Williamson Ctr Law Econ & Org, 27 Shan Da Nan Lu, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Indiana State University; Indiana State University; Shandong University; Shandong University,"Liu, ZY (通讯作者)，Indiana State Univ, Scott Coll Business, 30 N 7th St, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.;Liu, ZY (通讯作者)，Indiana State Univ, Networks Financial Inst, 30 N 7th St, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",john.liu@indstate.edu; qiaoyue@sdu.edu.cn,"Liu, Zhiyong/CAF-2366-2022","Liu, Zhiyong/0000-0001-6473-348X; Liu, Zhiyong/0000-0001-6800-1569",YSPSDU program of Shandong University,YSPSDU program of Shandong University,"For their helpful comments, we thank Aditya Bhattacharjea, Liang Lu, and Yudan Sun.

Exploring the cases of pension reform in different countries, we find that, although they are very different, the cases share a common characteristic: they shift risks away from workers towards those who are retired. Furthermore, population ageing, by increasing the weight of the elderly relative to working generations, raises the price of intergenerational risk sharing. Combining these findings, we argue and show formally that pension reform can be seen as a welfare-best response to population ageing.","[Bonenkamp, Jan; Ponds, Eduard] APG Asset Management, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Meijdam, Lex; Ponds, Eduard; Westerhout, Ed] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Westerhout, Ed] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands",Tilburg University; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Westerhout, E (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands.;Westerhout, E (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.",ewesterhout@ziggo.nl,,"Westerhout, Ed/0000-0003-3123-702X; Meijdam, Lex/0000-0002-9626-5761; ponds, eduard/0000-0002-8947-5795",,,,,43,11,14,8,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In this heterogenous world, couples are sorted by their preferences. If a couple's common preferences satisfy a certain condition, the couple have an interest in instilling those preferences into their children. Policies are generally nonneutral.

Both cities have large bus systems. However, the share of bus users is much higher in Mumbai as compared to Delhi. There is a need to enhance the share of bus users in Delhi to reduce the growing traffic externalities in the city. The objective of this work is to compare the existing bus services of Delhi and Mumbai, and identify feasible strategies to improve the bus system in Delhi. A total of 1347 and 1045 bus passengers were surveyed in Delhi and Mumbai respectively to compare the existing bus systems of both cities. Further, 14 transportation experts in Delhi were surveyed to identify feasible improvement strategies in Delhi. Multinomial Logit (MNL) model and Sign test were used to analyze the perception of bus users. The analyses reveal that overcrowding is a major concern in both the cities. But, unlike Mumbai, Delhi buses are perceived as less punctual and more time consuming by non-captives users. As a result, share of non-captive users that travel by buses in Mumbai is higher as compared to Delhi. In terms of interventions, improved comfort, punctuality, and safety are considered relatively easier to achieve in Delhi as compared to reduction in travel time by experts. It is concluded that strategies to improve comfort, punctuality, travel time, and safety should be prioritized for bus services in Delhi.","[Suman, Hemant K.; Bolia, Nomesh B.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi 110016, India; [Tiwari, Geetam] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Suman, HK (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.",hemantsmn@mech.iitd.ac.in; nomesh@mech.iitd.ac.in; geetamt@civil.iitd.ac.in,"Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023; Tiwari, Geetam/ABH-5766-2020; Suman, Hemant/AAF-1876-2019","Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829; Suman, Hemant/0000-0003-4875-2263; Bolia, Nomesh/0000-0002-2465-8187","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India [RS/FTP/ETA/0025/2011]","Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This research has been partially supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India with grant number RS/FTP/ETA/0025/2011.

The identification of the impact of such agreement allows for trade policy negotiation adjustment that can be beneficial for South Africa. Aim: The aim of the study is to estimate and discuss the impact of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union and South Africa. More specifically, the study intends to estimate the impact of revenue, welfare, imports, exports, trade creation and to come up with policies options for South Africa that can be used in negotiations and policy formulations. Setting: The study used international trade data (2012) available in the WITS-SMART model to assess bilateral trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa. Methods: To identify the impact on revenue, welfare, imports, exports and trade creation, the study simulated an FTA (0% tariff rate) for all goods exchanged between the European Union and South Africa. Also, the elasticity of substitution used for the simulation model was 99%. Results: The findings of the study reveal that total trade effects in South Africa are likely to surge by US$ 1.036 billion with a total welfare valued at US$ 134 million. Dismantling tariffs on all European Union (EU) goods would be beneficial to consumers through net trade creation. Total trade creation would be US$ 782 million. However, South African producers are likely to contribute a trade diversion of US$ 254 million which has a negative impact on consumer welfare. The country might also experience a revenue loss amounting to US$ 562 million because of the removal of tariffs. In trade, the country's exports and imports to the EU are expected to increase by US$ 12.419 million and US$ 1.266 million, respectively. Conclusion: The European Union-South Africa FTA would result in both trade creation and trade expansion effects. However, trade creation and revenue loss are potential threats. In order to mitigate revenue loss, government needs to consider alternative tax such as consumption tax on certain goods and value-added tax.","[Guei, Kore M.

Within the industry, there is considerable interest in replacing traditional paper-based self-complete surveys with new approaches that might lower costs or generate better quality data. However, very limited research has been done to identify the relative performance of different transit passenger survey modes. This paper begins to fill that gap. The research investigates the relative data quality for three different bus passenger survey methods distributed or administered on the transit vehicle: self-complete paper surveys, interviewer-assisted tablet based surveys, and self-complete online surveys. The research used an experimental design, with the same survey questionnaire distributed via the three survey modes. All factors about the survey and distribution process were kept identical to the extent feasible, so that the only variation would be the survey mode itself. The findings by survey mode are compared in terms of the overall response and completion rates, the completion rate for individual questions, respondent demographics, and labor costs per complete. The study results suggest that many agencies may still find the old-fashioned, low-tech paper survey to be the best option for bus passenger surveys. The paper mode required less labor per complete, and for many of the metrics discussed it generated data that was as good as or better than the tablet survey. In addition, the findings suggest that online survey invitations distributed on the transit vehicle are not a good option because they were labor intensive and had very low response rates.","[Agrawal, Asha Weinsten; Granger-Bevan, Stephen; Newmark, Gregory L.; Nixon, Hilary] Mineta Transportat Inst, San Jose, CA 95112 USA",,"Agrawal, AW (通讯作者)，Mineta Transportat Inst, San Jose, CA 95112 USA.",Asha.weinstein.agrawal@sjsu.edu; stephen.grangerbevan.sjsu@gmail.com; gnewmark@ksu.edu; hilary.nixon@sjsu.edu,"Newmark, Gregory/JHU-7498-2023","Newmark, Gregory/0000-0002-8780-8832; Nixon, Hilary/0000-0001-5378-3473",Mineta Transportation Institute,Mineta Transportation Institute,"The authors thank the Mineta Transportation Institute for funding this research.

Based on a large representative German dataset including IQ test scores and measures of non-cognitive skills, a restricted maximum likelihood model indicates a strong relationship between family background and skill formation. Sibling correlations in non-cognitive skills range from 0.22 to 0.46; therefore, at least one-fifth of the variance in these skills results from shared sibling-related factors. Sibling correlations in cognitive skills are higher than 0.50; therefore, more than half of the inequality in cognition can be explained by shared family background. Comparing these findings with those in the intergenerational skill transmission literature suggests that intergenerational correlations capture only part of the influence of family on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as confirmed by decomposition analyses and in line with previous findings on educational and income mobility.","[Anger, Silke] IAB Nuremberg, Res Dept Educ & Employment Lifecourse, Regensburger Str 100, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Anger, Silke] Univ Bamberg, Fac Social Sci Econ & Business Adm, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany; [Anger, Silke] IZA Bonn, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Schnitzlein, Daniel D.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Lab Econ, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Schnitzlein, Daniel D.] DIW Berlin, SOEP Dept, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Leibniz University Hannover; IZA Institute Labor Economics; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,,silke.anger@iab.de; schnitzlein@aoek.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,59,31,32,5,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

We find that being the oldest child gives an education benefit to male and not female children who are often assigned supervisory roles for younger siblings. Most importantly, an increase in the fraction of female siblings leads to a significant increase in education of Chinese men and to a lesser extent Chinese women. This effect is concentrated among those with rural Hukou. In China, male children absorbed more education resources so that in a credit constrained family, increases in fraction of siblings who are sisters frees up resources for educating boys. This is less so for girls since their education was lower and additional resources would not be used for them.","[Lei, Xiaoyan; Shen, Yan] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, CCER, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Smith, James P.] RAND Corp, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Zhou, Guangsu] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, CICCE, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Peking University; RAND Corporation; Nankai University,,smith@rand.org,"smith, james/HTQ-1933-2023",,"National Institute on Aging [P01AG022481, R37-AG025529]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71490732, 2016KEY02]",National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging (P01AG022481 and R37-AG025529) and the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 71490732 and 2016KEY02).

This paper examines how Sauvy's intuition can be incorporated in the Samuelsonian optimal fertility model (Samuelson, Int Econ Rev 16:531-538, 1975). We build a four-period OLG model with physical capital and with two generations of workers (young and old), the skills of the latter being subject to some form of decay. We characterize the optimal fertility rate and show that this equalizes, at the margin, the sum of the capital dilution effect (Solow effect) and the labour age-composition effect (Sauvy effect) with the intergenerational redistribution effect (Samuelson effect). Numerical simulations show that it is hard, from a quantitative perspective, to reconcile Sauvy's recommendation with facts. This leads us to examine other potential determinants of optimal fertility, by introducing technological progress and a more general social welfare function.","[Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, CORE, Liege, Belgium; [Pestieau, Pierre] Univ Liege, Paris Sch Econ, Liege, Belgium; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Univ Paris East ERUDITE, Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan,Bldg B,Off 009, F-75014 Paris, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Inst Univ France, Paris, France",University of Liege; University of Liege; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Paris School of Economics; Institut Universitaire de France,"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris East ERUDITE, Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan,Bldg B,Off 009, F-75014 Paris, France.;Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Inst Univ France, Paris, France.",gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,,,,,27,4,4,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

More precisely, we compare two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, namely wavelet networks and genetic programming, with the classic linear approaches that are used widely in the pricing of temperature derivatives in the financial weather market, as well as with various machine learning benchmark models such as neural networks, radial basis functions and support vector regression. The accuracy of the valuation process depends on the accuracy of the temperature forecasts. Our proposed models are evaluated and compared, both in-sample and out-of-sample, in various locations where weather derivatives are traded. Furthermore, we expand our analysis by examining the stability of the forecasting models relative to the forecasting horizon. Our findings suggest that the proposed nonlinear methods outperform the alternative linear models significantly, with wavelet networks ranking first, and that they can be used for accurate weather derivative pricing in the weather market.

For each accident record, 48 different attributes had been collected at the time of the accident. After data preprocessing, the data were reduced to 16 attributes and four injury severity classes. In this study, WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) data-mining software was used to build the ANN classifier. The traffic accident data were used to build two classifiers in two different ways. The whole data set were used for training and validating the first classifier (training set), while 90% of the data were used for training the second classifier and the remaining 10% were used for testing it (testing set). The experimental results revealed that the developed ANN classifiers can predict accident severity with reasonable accuracy. The overall model prediction performance for the training and testing data were 81.6% and 74.6%, respectively. To improve the prediction accuracy of the ANN classifier, traffic accident data were split into three clusters using a k-means algorithm. The results after clustering revealed significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the ANN classifier, especially for the training dataset. In this work, and in order to validate the performance of the ANN model, an ordered probit model was also used as a comparative benchmark. The dependent variable (i.e. degree of injury) was transformed from ordinal to numerical (1, 2, 3, 4) for (minor, moderate, sever, death). The R tool was used to perform an ordered probit. For each accident, the ordered probit model showed how likely this accident would result in each class (minor, moderate, severe, death). The accuracy of 59.5% obtained from the ordered probit model was clearly less than the ANN accuracy value of 74.6%.

Among the intangibles based on knowledge, intellectual capital certainly occupies a prominent place. In recent years the increasing complexity that characterized the business management influenced companies to adopt new models of reporting and accounting, taking into account issues and intangible factors not considered so far with the right attention. The objective of this work, starting with a review of the existing literature on intellectual capital, intends not only to identify the most important intangibles within enterprises and classify them according to the three blocks which intellectual capital is divided (human capital, structural and relational capital), but also to show a number of indicators that can help them measure. Therefore the aim of the work is to build an integrated framework containing appropriate intellectual capital indicators useful to represent and measure this resource within companies.

The differences in profitability between countries are driven by manifold aspects, including the cost or revenue structures, the financing patterns and conditions, as well as taxation. The aim of this study is to analyse such differences in profitability between Czech and German enterprises. A model-based cumulative analysis of variances shows the impacts of the underlying drivers of profitability. For this reason, the average values of these drivers from the years 2002 to 2014 - the longest time series available for both countries - are extracted from the BACH database (download 29/04/17), which provides harmonised accounting information for several European countries.

Based on this state-of-the-art literature review, directions for future research are discussed.","[Block, Joern H.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Block, Joern H.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Management ERIM, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Block, Joern H.; Fisch, Christian O.] Univ Trier, Dept Management, Trier, Germany; [Fisch, Christian O.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Praag, Mirjam] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [van Praag, Mirjam] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Copenhagen Business School; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Block, JH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Block, JH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Inst Management ERIM, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Block, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Management, Trier, Germany.",block@uni-trier.de,"Block, Joern/K-2208-2016","Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346; Fisch, Christian/0000-0003-3609-7193",Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Chair; Danish DEA Thinktank,Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Chair; Danish DEA Thinktank,"We thank Tim van der Weert and Bernd Balle for excellent research assistance, Karl Wennberg as well as Christoph Grimpe for careful reviews of earlier versions, and Philipp Koellinger for pointing us to important papers on innovative entrepreneurship that were not brought up using our search criteria.

However, only a small number of studies have examined how these strategic tools influence employees' attitudes and behaviours. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to analyse how employees' perceptions of brand identity management and corporate social responsibility affect their attitudes and behaviours. An empirical study was undertaken among a sample of 297 front line employees working in the UK banking sector. Hypotheses were tested using partial least square regression. The results show that employees' perceptions of brand identity management and corporate social responsibility determine their commitment towards their organisations, both directly and indirectly through perceived external prestige. Organisational commitment explains employees' brand performance and brand citizenship behaviour. Age differences indicate higher impact of brand identity management on older employees, and higher effects of perceived corporate social responsibility in younger employees. The results extend existing knowledge and are informative for bank managers.","[Bravo, Rafael; Martinez, Eva] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Business & Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Buil, Isabel] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Business & Econ, Maria de Luna S-N,Edificio Lorenzo Normante, Zaragoza 50018, Spain; [de Chernatony, Leslie] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza; Aston University,"Buil, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Business & Econ, Maria de Luna S-N,Edificio Lorenzo Normante, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.",rbravo@unizar.es; ibuil@unizar.es; dechernatony@btinternet.com; emartine@unizar.es,"Buil, Isabel/ABF-6246-2020; Bravo Gil, Rafael/K-1804-2017","Buil, Isabel/0000-0001-6631-8909; Bravo Gil, Rafael/0000-0003-4038-1840",Government of Spain [ECO2013-41257-P]; Government of Aragon; European Social Fund under project GENERES [S-09]; Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada of Zaragoza; DGA (CONSI+D) under Programa Europa XXI de Estancias de Investigacion; Subprograma de estancias de movilidad de profesores e investigadores seniores en centros extranjeros de ensenanza superior e investigacion; incluido el Programa Salvador de Madariaga under Grant [PR2011-0352],Government of Spain(Spanish Government); Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Social Fund under project GENERES; Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada of Zaragoza; DGA (CONSI+D) under Programa Europa XXI de Estancias de Investigacion; Subprograma de estancias de movilidad de profesores e investigadores seniores en centros extranjeros de ensenanza superior e investigacion; incluido el Programa Salvador de Madariaga under Grant,"This work was supported by the Government of Spain under Grant ECO2013-41257-P; the Government of Aragon and the European Social Fund under project GENERES S-09; the Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada of Zaragoza and the DGA (CONSI+D) under Programa Europa XXI de Estancias de Investigacion; and the Subprograma de estancias de movilidad de profesores e investigadores seniores en centros extranjeros de ensenanza superior e investigacion, incluido el Programa Salvador de Madariaga under Grant PR2011-0352.",,48,14,17,0,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In-depth interviews were conducted with a panel of experts to adapt a set of experience dimensions identified from the literature to the offline environment. A survey was then designed to collect data from consumers who had bought in a retailer, where marketing strategies are linked with experience dimensions. Retailers may use this typology in order to re-design their marketing strategies. Retailers must invest in utilitarian attributes of product assortment offered to consumers, improving quality while maintaining prices and promotions. If a retailer can stimulate social shopping and consumer curiosity, such as imagination and creativity in the store, they will have more devoted consumers.","[Cachero-Martinez, Silvia] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Empresa, Catedra Fdn Ramon Areces Distribuc Comercial, Ave Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain; [Vazquez-Casielles, Rodolfo] Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Empresa, Ave Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Cachero-Martínez, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Empresa, Catedra Fdn Ramon Areces Distribuc Comercial, Ave Cristo S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",cacherosilvia@uniovi.es; rvazquez@uniovi.es,"Cachero-Martínez, Silvia/AAA-3028-2019","Cachero-Martinez, Silvia/0000-0001-6055-138X",Catedra Fundacion Ramon Areces de Distribucion Comercial,Catedra Fundacion Ramon Areces de Distribucion Comercial,The authors are grateful to Catedra Fundacion Ramon Areces de Distribucion Comercial (http://catedrafundacionarecesdc.uniovi.es) for their valuable support to develop this empirical research.,,57,27,31,4,60,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The study, total government expenditure on social and community services and its effect on economic growth in Nigeria, is an attempt at highlighting the quantity and quality of national commitment (through public expenditure) to education, health and the socially and economically disadvantaged using time series data from 1961 to 2013, obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria Annual Report and Statement of Account. Using error correction model (ECM), the results indicate that total expenditure on social and community services is not statistically significant but has a positive relationship on economic growth in Nigeria in the long run, while in the short run, total expenditure on social and community services is highly and statistically significant and has a positive relationship on economic growth in Nigeria, and the speed of adjustment to equilibrium is 44 % within a year when the variables wander away from their equilibrium values. The result of Granger causality does validate the applicability of Wagner's law in Nigeria but doesn't support a unidirectional causality from public expenditure to growth and thereby not validating the applicability of Keynesian approach in the country. The result has an important implication in terms of policy and budget implementation in Nigerian. We conclude that economic growth has a positive relationship with total expenditure on social and community services and recommends that there is need to increase the allocation meant for the sectors and also ensure that the resources are properly managed and used.","[Ihugba, Okezie A.; Njoku, Asoluka C.] Alvan Ikoku Fed Coll Educ, Dept Econ, Owerri, Nigeria",,"Ihugba, OA (通讯作者)，Alvan Ikoku Fed Coll Educ, Dept Econ, Owerri, Nigeria.",ihugbablack@yahoo.com,,"Ihugba, Okezie A./0000-0001-9276-9260",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,59,71,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_5,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400005,0

The need for the strategic use of Information Technology in order to add value to businesses is more urgent for Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) which have been negatively affected from financial crisis. The strategic use will be achieved by aligning business strategy, objectives, and planning with Information Systems. Strategic alignment has an impact not only on firm's profitability, but on the increase of sales, on the customer's satisfaction, and on the competitive advantage as well. Strategic use of information management increases the knowledge about customers' and market's needs, as well as about the environmental circumstances, and gives the opportunity to businesses to produce new products and services which meet market's needs and increase firm's profitability and competitiveness. A major factor which affects the strategic alignment, except information handling, is the support of information technology by managers and the creation of a related business culture. This paper aims to provide a holistic approach for issues about strategic alignment and ending up to proposes for SMEs in order to implement the alignment process and increase their firm's performance. The analysis of strategic alignment starts with its necessity and importance, as well as the presentation of steps and factors which influence the success of the process, the link with firm performance follows, and it concludes to the presentation of the need to be implemented by SMEs in order to increase their competitive advantage in the current turbulent financial environment.","[Kitsios, Fotis; Kamariotou, Maria] Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Kitsios, F (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece.",kitsios@uom.gr; tm1367@uom.edu.gr,"Kitsios, Fotis C./B-2286-2017; Kamariotou, Maria/AAZ-8488-2021","Kitsios, Fotis C./0000-0001-7269-5567; Kamariotou, Maria/0000-0002-7873-9265",,,,,64,14,14,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,503,525,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_33,0.0,,,23,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400033,0

The study considered 12 major sectors and estimated productivity growth and the major sources of productivity growth during the period 1981-82 to 2007-08. The study found that the productivity growth in the industrial sector of Tamil Nadu at the aggregate level during the test period was almost nil. While it is the case at the aggregate level, there are mixed results at the sectoral level. During the pre-reform period, there was significantly higher productivity growth in almost all the sectors contributed mainly by the improvements in efficiency. On other hand, there was productivity deterioration in the post-reform period since almost all the sectors witnessed negative productivity growth despite a technical change in the post-reform period. The study based on the empirical findings suggests that there will be productivity growth only if any improvement in the technology is accompanied by the corresponding improvement in the efficiency with which the technology can be turned into productivity gains. A well developed and skilled labour force along with the improvements in the technological developments will lead to higher productivity growth in the manufacturing sector both at the aggregate and sectoral level.","[Kumar, T.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a tool to evaluate and compare B2C e-commerce intensity in economies. The authors address the following research questions: What is the position of individual EU member states in terms of B2C e-commerce intensity? Is there a strong correlation between B2C e-commerce intensity and the level of economic development of EU member states? Is there a correlation between B2C e-commerce intensity and the length of the countries' EU membership? From a theoretical background, key indicators of B2C e-commerce intensity are selected, which are aggregated into the B2C e-commerce intensity index using the TOPSIS method. The results of the multi-criteria evaluation and the positions of individual countries in the overall order indicate that in terms of B2C e-commerce intensity, EU member states are a rather heterogeneous group. The order of countries based on the value of the B2C e-commerce intensity index exhibits a strong and statistically significant correlation with the order of the countries in terms of the level of their economic development. However, the differences in the countries' economic development do not sufficiently explain the differences in the use of B2C e-commerce. The results indicate that there is a large unused potential of B2C e-commerce in the EU, not only in countries with weaker economies, but also in highly developed countries. The correlation between B2C e-commerce intensity and the duration of EU membership is moderate. It would be beneficial for further research to focus on the question of which factors have boosted the relatively high use of B2C e-commerce in some new EU member states with lower level of economic development (Estonia and Lithuania) and what obstacles prevent more intensive use of B2C e-commerce in Italy and Austria, whose level of economic development significantly exceeds that of the aforementioned countries.","[Kunesova, Hana; Eger, Ludvik] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Kunesová, H (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic.",kunesova@kmo.zcu.cz; leger@kmo.zcu.cz,"Kunesova, Hana/S-8989-2016; Eger, Ludvik/C-1330-2016","Kunesova, Hana/0000-0002-1242-3911; Eger, Ludvik/0000-0002-5437-3297",,,,,56,8,9,1,20,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Then, the study is extended by using COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) framework and PMBOK Guide (A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge) through identification, description and evaluation of general roles and structures related to and in relation with the notion of project, which is not included in Scrum but potentially interacted with Scrum structures.

However, there are various reasons to question the adequacy of this dichotomous, recession/expansion approach for our understanding of the business cycle dynamics, as well as for the prediction of future business cycle developments. In this context, the contribution of this paper to the literature is twofold. First, since a positive rate of growth at the level of economic activity can be considered as the normal scenario in modern economies due to both population and technological growth, it proposes a new non-parametric algorithm for the detection and dating of economic acceleration periods, trend or normal growth periods, and economic recessions. Second, it uses an ordered probit framework for the estimation and forecasting of these three business cycle phases, applying an automatized model selection approach using monthly macroeconomic and financial data on the German economy. The empirical results show that this approach has superior out-of-sample properties under real-time conditions compared to alternative probit models specified individually for the prediction of recessions and/or economic accelerations.

We see how Michael Porter integrates the critical perspective on CSR from Friedman in a strategic concept of philanthropy, corporate social responsibility and creating shared value (CSV). Accordingly, the concept of creating shared value should be considered as a development of the ideas of strategic philanthropy and corporate social responsibility in the perspective of capitalism and freedom. At the same time, however, the concept of creating shared value is broader and more oriented towards society and towards the idea of profit-based CSR since it integrates the values of society and business in corporate legitimacy.","[Rendtorff, Jacob Dahl] Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Rendtorff, JD (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Roskilde, Denmark.",jacrendt@ruc.dk,"Rendtorff, Jacob Dahl/S-6216-2018","Rendtorff, Jacob Dahl/0000-0001-9021-4720",,,,,31,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-2707,,978-3-319-48802-8; 978-3-319-48801-1,ETHICAL ECON,,,2017,52.0,,,,,,119,139,,10.1007/978-3-319-48802-8_7,0.0,,,21,Economics; Ethics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI6HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413288200007,0

The study involves the analysis of 147 questionnaire-based survey of managers from plastic manufacturing SMEs operating in Portugal that were subjected to a Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results show that proactive firms to external stimuli are not only better at innovating but also their entrepreneurial orientation capabilities underpin a better performance in international markets when compared with firms that react to external stimuli. This study has implications for SMEs aiming at increasing their export performance and innovativeness. For practitioners the findings of this study should enable SMEs owner/managers to better understand the possible impacts of innovation capabilities and entrepreneurial orientation on export performance, and thus lead to more effective SMEs management.","[Ribau, Claudia P.] Univ Aveiro, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Moreira, Antonio C.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Raposo, Mario] Univ Beira Interior, NECE, Management & Econ Dept, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Ribau, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",cpr@ua.pt; amoreira@ua.pt; mraposo@ubi.pt,"Ribau, Cláudia CPR/P-4883-2017; Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/C-8186-2012; Moreira, Antonio/K-4259-2017","Ribau, Cláudia CPR/0000-0003-2796-0354; Raposo, Mário Lino Barata/0000-0001-6213-5355; Moreira, Antonio/0000-0002-6613-8796",,,,,55,46,48,3,51,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Fabless firms are considered to have an advantage in product innovation, as they can focus their innovation efforts on chip design and can benefit from investments in process innovation made by their manufacturing partners, However, there is little empirical evidence of the performance of fabless firms compared to vertically integrated firms. This research empirically examines the relationship between R&D and the financial performance of fabless and vertically integrated firms from 2000 to 2010. Our results show that fabless firms maintain higher gross and net margins, earn a higher return on assets (ROA) and have greater intangible value (Tobin's q) than vertically integrated firms when controlling for size, capital intensity and R&D ratio (R&D/sales). This supports the argument that fabless firms achieve greater performance by focusing on one part of the innovation process. The relationship of R&D ratio to net margin is negative for the whole sample, suggesting that the industry may be overinvesting in R&D. Notably, the negative relationship is greater for fabless firms, which spend a higher amount of their sales on R&D. The relationship of R&D ratio to ROA and Tobin's q is negative, and there is no significant difference between fabless and integrated firms. We conclude that fabless firms outperform integrated firms overall, but are somewhat worse in terms of increasing profits and creating value from their R&D investments.","[Shin, Namchul] Pace Univ, Seidenberg Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Kraemer, Kenneth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Patil Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA USA; [Dedrick, Jason] Syracuse Univ, Sch Informat Studies, New York, NY USA",Pace University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Syracuse University,"Shin, N (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, Seidenberg Sch Comp Sci & Informat Syst, New York, NY 10038 USA.",nshin@pace.edu,,,,,,,28,28,32,5,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The authors conducted an analysis of the financial policy's impact of local government units on the development of entrepreneurship. As explanatory variables in the article, the authors adopted instruments of entrepreneurship support that were based on the revenue side and the expenditure side of the budget. The list of these variables is as follows: total tax income on real estate, total tax income on transport, total income from property, total expenditure on property, product of variables describing tax income and property expenditure. As outcome variable, the authors adopted level of entrepreneurship in municipalities measured by the number of newly registered business entities per capita. While the control variable was the ratio called population density. The output dependent variable was divided by the number of working age population, while the output independent variables (revenue and expenditure instruments of financial policy of local authorities) were divided by the total population. Analysis was performed based on logarithmic averages for annual data that was collected at the commune level. Based on collected data, authors had constructed six models that were later estimated. The estimation of parameters of models was done using linear regression. Regression model for averages proved that local government units fiscal policy expressed in tax instruments strongly affect entrepreneurship, with assumption of simultaneous usage of several stimulants. Income instruments most strongly influence the development of entrepreneurship. Among these instruments the biggest impact on entrepreneurship have tax instruments, in particular the real estate tax. Expenditure instruments that most strongly influence entrepreneurship are capital expenditures. Finally, the effectiveness of financial forms of support is conditioned by stability and continuity of fiscal policies implemented by local governments. Analyzed model positively verifies opinions from literature that use by local authorities single instruments of entrepreneurship support (especially taxes) brings weaker results than the use of a set of a tax-including instruments.","[Skica, Tomasz; Rodzinka, Jacek] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Finance, Rzeszow, Poland; [Harasym, Ruslan] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Econ, Rzeszow, Poland",University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow; University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Skica, T (通讯作者)，Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Finance, Rzeszow, Poland.",tskica@wsiz.rzeszow.pl; jrodzinka@wsiz.rzeszow.pl; rharasym@wsiz.rzeszow.pl,,"Skica, Tomasz/0000-0002-5620-610X",National Science Centre [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/01022],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",The article was prepared based on results of the project that was financed from the funds of National Science Centre given by decision with number DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/01022.,,44,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,257,269,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_24,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500024,0

A migraine is a type of disease where a headache can occur in combination with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity. A migraine is common and widely spread disease with impact on companies and people's lives. As shown in past studies the economic burden in the form of decreased productivity and increased costs should not be ignored especially nowadays when the strong global competition requires a high level of efficiency. In our research, we found that 72% of respondents suffered from some version of a migraine. We also found that 60% of them declared a workload between high and maximal We did not find a significant linkage between a migraine and perceived exhaustion.

The extensively used factor model proposed initially by Sharpe in 1963 has provided a robust backdrop for development of relevant, micro, macro, and context-specific or asset specific explanatory variables to be incorporated in a statistical manner as inputs to forecasting models that can then be used to obtain risk measures upon which portfolio allocations are based. However, like all statistical models, a set of statistical assumptions accompany this factor model regression framework, one of which has recently been highlighted as seemingly nonvalidated in financial data. This is, of course, the assumption such factor models make on homoskedasticity or weak-sense covariance stationarity of the returns processes being modeled. Such factor models, therefore, have typically failed to cope with an important and ubiquitous feature of financial assets data, which often demonstrates heteroskedasticity of the returns variances and covariances. We propose a novel generalized multifactor forecasting structure utilizing a covariance regression model, which allows us to incorporate the required heteroskedasticity effects while also admitting potential dependence in the idiosyncratic error terms. We argue that such a modeling approach allows for more explicit relationships to be interpreted between the driving factors and the conditional responses of the portfolio returns. We then compare the forecasting performances of our model with the multifactor model and the time series dynamic conditional correlation model through a currency portfolio application.","[Ames, Matthew] Inst Stat Math, Tokyo, Japan; [Bagnarosa, Guillaume] Rennes Sch Business, Rennes, France; [Peters, Gareth W.] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Peters, Gareth W.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst, Oxford, England; [Peters, Gareth W.] London Sch Econ, Syst Risk Ctr, London, England; [Shevchenko, Pavel V.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM) - Japan; Universite de Rennes; Heriot Watt University; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Macquarie University,"Ames, M (通讯作者)，Inst Stat Math, Dept Stat Modeling, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908562, Japan.",m-ames@ism.ac.jp,"Shevchenko, Pavel/C-1718-2009","Shevchenko, Pavel/0000-0001-8104-8716; BAGNAROSA, GUILLAUME/0000-0002-3679-790X; Peters, Gareth/0000-0003-2768-8979","Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects [DP160103489]; ESRC [ES/R009724/1, ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects(Australian Research Council); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects, Grant/Award Number: DP160103489",,75,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

This eliminates all wasteful queueing. With homogeneous values of time, the private costs of consumers are unchanged, but the large maximum value of the first-best toll may make it politically infeasible. In this paper, I consider continuously time-varying partial peak-load tolls that have a much lower maximum value, but which still achieve a large fraction of the efficiency gain of the first-best toll. With heterogeneous values of time, a partial peak-load toll can leave all consumers with unchanged or decreased private costs even when the first-best toll does not do this.","[Braid, Ralph M.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",Wayne State University,"Braid, RM (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",rbraid@wayne.edu,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

A worker, after receiving a superior outside offer, initiates a wage renegotiation with his current employer. During the renegotiation, whenever a proposal is rejected, the worker decides whether to opt out. When the two parties are sufficiently patient, any wage level between the outside offer and the entire net surplus can be sustained in equilibrium. Opting out may also arise in equilibrium. This result is in stark contrast to existing studies, in which the outside option is sometimes a credible threat, but is never exercised in equilibrium.","[Chen, Fengjiao; Li, Duozhe] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ko, Chiu Yu] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",Chinese University of Hong Kong; National University of Singapore,"Chen, FJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jocelyncfj@gmail.com; kochiuyu@nus.edu.sg; duozheli@cuhk.edu.hk,"Ko, Chiu Yu/AAP-5497-2021","Ko, Chiu Yu/0000-0001-8590-6159",Hong Kong Research Grants Council [CUHK450011]; Singapore Ministry of Education [FY2014-FRC4-001],"Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","Hong Kong Research Grants Council, Grant/Award Number: General Research Fund/Project No. CUHK450011; Singapore Ministry of Education, Grant/Award Number: Academic Research Fund Tier Fund/Project No. FY2014-FRC4-001",,27,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

While it has been acknowledged that artistic performances in public space generate specific appropriations of the urban environment, the role that specific sensorial channels play in these events is still underexplored. Drawing upon fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2016 in Chiado, our study highlights how dance, music and architecture stimulate, invoke and highlight specific senses while rendering others unnoticed. This causes shifts in bodily rhythms, mood and attention to details in urban space. As certain corporeal isles are enacted through contemplation, the experience and appropriation of urban space is subject to change.

The loan's interest rate reflects the funder's information about the strength of the plaintiff's case. We analyze a monopoly and a two-firm Bertrand model. Bertrand competition does not eliminate funders' profits or inefficiency. Making the funding contract admissible evidence enables the funder to increase its chance of recovery by reducing the interest rate to signal to the court that the plaintiff has a strong case. Under monopoly, there is only a separating equilibrium without admissible funding. With admissible funding, there is either a pooling equilibrium or a separating equilibrium, but either increases the joint welfare of plaintiffs and funders. Under Bertrand competition, admissible funding increases joint welfare if courts can make adverse inferences from the absence of funding contracts. Plaintiffs are generally better off under admissibility if they discount the future sufficiently.","[Avraham, Ronen; Wickelgren, Abraham L.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Avraham, R (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,14,1,1,1,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Our model motivates empirical hypotheses, which we test using data from manufacturers subject to the Clean Water Act. We find that penalties create positive spillovers for other facilities facing the same regulatory authority, such that enforcement actions reduce pollution at facilities in the same regulatory jurisdiction. However, penalties generate negative spillovers for facilities in the same industry facing a different authority, such that enforcement actions increase pollution at facilities in the same industry but facing a different regulator.

To explore the interaction between different components of daily volatility, this paper attempts to separately model the dynamics of continuous variation, the discontinuous jump, and the overnight return variance by including leverage effects. The findings show that lagged continuous and discontinuous jump variations generate significant impacts on future continuous segments, discontinuous jump segments, and the overnight return variance. Furthermore, in addition to the usual leverage effects, additional leverage effects with respect to overnight returns are found to play a significant role in volatility forecasting. Finally, out-of-sample forecasts are investigated; the results show that the new HAR-CJN model can describe and predict daily volatility more accurately than other HAR models.","[Zhang, Hongwei; Zhu, Xuehong] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongwei; Zhu, Xuehong; Guo, Yaoqi] Cent S Univ, Inst Met Resources Strategy, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yaoqi] Cent S Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haibo] Konka Grp Co Ltd, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University; Central South University,"Guo, YQ (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",guoyaoqi@csu.edu.cn,"guo, yaoqi/HKM-3564-2023; Zhang, Hw/HPD-4999-2023; Wang, Junzhe/KCK-4991-2024; Liu, Haibo/JWP-8549-2024; chen, boyu/KCY-0814-2024","Liu, Haibo/0000-0002-4213-2883;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633006, 71403298, 71701176]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13 ZD169]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71633006, 71403298 and 71701176; National Social Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 13 & ZD169",,49,14,14,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

However, stakeholders like employees and shareholders also have a direct financial interest in those companies and need to be assured that company actions bring forth some financial benefit. Aim: The research investigated one of the main questions surrounding the concept of corporate socially responsibility, namely whether a company's investment in and effort towards corporate social responsibility results in improved financial performance. The purpose of this study was to narrow the gap in the body of knowledge in relation to corporate social responsibility and its relationship to financial performance. Setting: This research investigated whether there was a relationship between being listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index and financial performance. The unit of study comprises 885 company-years of companies listed on the JSE over the period 2009-2014. Methods: Logistic regression was used to find evidence of a relationship between a listing on the JSE SRI Index and financial performance. Results: It is evident that there was no real relationship between inclusion on the JSE SRI Index and financial performance, but there was a direct relationship between the size of a company and having a listing on the JSE SRI Index. Conclusion: A listing on the JSE SRI Index does not have a clear and direct impact on financial performance, but it appeared that larger companies are perhaps better able to invest in corporate social activities and are, as a result, more likely to be listed on the JSE SRI Index.","[du Toit, Elda; Lekoloane, Karabo] Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"du Toit, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",elda.dutoit@up.ac.za,"du Toit, Elda/D-5304-2013","du Toit, Elda/0000-0001-8386-7969; Lekoloane, Karabo/0000-0003-3986-8766",,,,,74,5,8,1,14,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The expected effect of the provision on fertility is not clear ex ante. By expanding insurance coverage to young adults, the provision may affect fertility directly through expanded options for obtaining contraceptives as well as through expanded options for obtaining pregnancy-, birth-, and infant-related care, and these may lead to decreased or increased fertility, respectively. In addition, the provision may also affect fertility indirectly through marriage or labor markets, and the direction and magnitude of these effects is difficult to determine. This paper considers the effect of the provision on fertility as well as the contributing channels by applying difference-in-differences type methods using the 2008-2010 and 2012-2013 American Community Survey, 2006-2009 and 2012-2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abortion surveillance data, and 2006-2010 and 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth. Results suggest that the provision is associated with decreases in the likelihood of having given birth and abortion rates and an increase in the likelihood of using long-term hormonal contraceptives.","[Abramowitz, Joelle] Univ Michigan, 3475 ISR Thompson,426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Abramowitz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 3475 ISR Thompson,426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jabramow@umich.edu,,,,,,,51,17,17,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In this paper, we draw attention to the fact that regulating insider trading encroaches upon the foundations of a free-market economy, and boils down to a question of envy, rather than justice. In particular, there is nothing undesirable, fraudulent or shameful in a process through which selected agents (the insiders) transform dispersed information into specialised knowledge, and make use of it. One may be envious that insiders make a profit or avoid a loss thanks to their privileged position. Yet, insiders do not steal any information and do not violate any property right. Their only constraint is an explicit contractual agreement with their employer. In that case, the government might be required to enforce the contract.

It is demonstrated that the proposed model has the potential to match or even surpass the accuracy of competing nonlinear forecasting models in terms of both fit and predictive ability. In addition, the model is successful at predicting various categories of high concentration events, between 53% and 76% of mid-range events, and around 90% of extreme-range events on average across all stations. This forecasting model is considered a useful tool for helping government authorities to anticipate critical episodes of poor air quality so as to avoid the detrimental economic and health impacts of extreme pollution levels.

The generational approach in the Intergenerational Redistributive Effects Model (IREM) deals with it through the ad-hoc concept of overlapping annual generations. This concept requires establishing the number of years (or timespan) included in the generation and how to incorporate in it those individuals living in years that are not the central one. To do so in a way that reflects the sensitivity of society to the effects of a major transport infrastructure project, specific surveys with a novel approach were designed. The outputs from the survey carried out in Catalonia show evidence suggesting that discount functions should tend to decline at a higher rate in the short term than in the long term. Thus, future impacts of transport investments, both future socio-economic net benefits and financial burdens, should be considered less important than immediate (present) outcomes in the decision-making process. Further, there are reasons to consider that discounting is not neutral to reflect the social interest of large-scale transport projects for the successive generations involved.","[Penyalver, Domingo] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Int Ctr Numer Methods Engn, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Turro, Mateu] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Transport & Reg Planning, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Edif C3-S120, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Zavala-Rojas, Diana] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Fac Polit & Social Sci, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Centre Internacional de Metodes Numerics en Enginyeria (CIMNE); Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Pompeu Fabra University,"Penyalver, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Int Ctr Numer Methods Engn, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",dopeyro@gmail.com; m.turro@upc.edu; diana.zavala@upf.edu,"Rojo, Domingo Peñalver/M-5544-2019","Rojo, Domingo Peñalver/0000-0001-5468-3546; Zavala-Rojas, Diana/0000-0003-4603-7434",European Investment Bank through the STAREBEI Programme; EIB,European Investment Bank through the STAREBEI Programme; EIB,"This research was financially supported by the European Investment Bank through the STAREBEI Programme.

This has implications for mode and destination choice for shopping travel and therefore also for sustainability, which need to be considered in planning policy. In this paper, we estimate models for shopping travel using an unusually rich data set of shopping attractions. We find that shopping travel is best represented in three separate models: consumables in short and long activity segments and durables. In all of these models, we show that representing nearby attractions outside the destination zone adds to the measured attraction. For long activity consumables and for durables, the addition of secondary attractions within 2 km of the main destination gives the best models. For short activity consumables, both 2 km and 5 km add to the model, but 5 km is slightly better. Furthermore, we find significant within-zone correlation in the consumables models but are unable to find significant between zone correlation, indicating that zone boundaries have some behavioural meaning for shopping travellers, but larger areas are not viewed in this way. Shopping attractions with a specifically Swedish impact, Systembolaget (official alcohol outlet in Sweden) and IKEA, proved to be important in all the models. These attractors work better as part of the size than as part of the utility, indicating that they appear to be separate attractors of trips, rather than as adding to the utility of other attractors. The models are also applied in two policy scenario analyses in which the impacts of new IKEA establishments and availability of Systembolaget in all zones on destination and mode choice are assessed.","[Kristoffersson, Ida] VTI Swedish Rd & Transport Res Inst, Box 55685, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Daly, Andrew] Univ Leeds, ITS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Daly, Andrew] RAND Europe, Cambridge, England; [Daly, Andrew] CTS, Stockholm, Sweden; [Algers, Staffan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",VTI; University of Leeds; RAND Corporation; RAND Europe; Royal Institute of Technology,"Kristoffersson, I (通讯作者)，VTI Swedish Rd & Transport Res Inst, Box 55685, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",ida.kristoffersson@vti.se; andrew@alogit.com; algers@kth.se,,"Kristoffersson, Ida/0000-0002-3738-9318; Daly, Andrew/0000-0001-5319-2745",,,,,34,16,17,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The disclosure of drug risks is intended to provide consumers with a balanced view of the advertised drugs. However, unintended consequences of the disclosure have been observed in previous DTCA research including an influence on trust toward the ad and manufacturer. To better understand this, an experiment was conducted across two health conditions (seasonal allergies and diabetes) to examine the role of the amount of side effect information and attribution of side effects disclosure in judgments of positive advertiser motives, trustworthiness, brand attitude, and behavioral intentions. Results indicated brand attitude and behavioral intentions differed by amount of side effect information mediated by advertiser trust. Attribution of side effects information to regulations provided a limited moderation of this effect. Suggested implications include more explicit identification of mandated information within the ads.","[Ball, Jennifer Gerard] Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, Advertising & Publ Relat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Ball, JG (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, Advertising & Publ Relat, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",jennifer.gerard.ball@temple.edu,"Ball, Jennifer/AFE-1419-2022","Ball, Jennifer/0000-0001-8191-9374",,,,,66,9,9,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Survivor estimates of economies of scale using the 1987 and 1992 Censuses of Manufactures clearly illustrate a general movement toward smaller scales. Moving beyond prior survivor studies, the sources of changes in scale are investigated. However, increases in either number of establishments or value added had a statistically significant effect on the occurrence of a change in scale, respectively decreasing or increasing the likelihood of change.

The Suzhou National High-tech District tram was investigated as a case study. Two key findings are highlighted. Firstly, the new tramway was routed along the path of least resistance avoiding dense urban areas, to reduce conflict with cars. Secondly, regarding urban transport integration, four perspectives were evaluated, namely planning and design, service operation, transport governance and user experience. Findings show insufficient integration in the following aspects, namely tram and bus routes and services, fares on multi-modal journeys, tram station distribution, service intervals, and luggage auxiliary support. The paper argues there is a need for a critical review of the role of tram and for context-based innovative policy reform and governance that could possibly facilitate a successful introduction and integration of tram into a city.","[Chen, Chia-Lin] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Dushu Lake Higher Educ Town, Room EB510,Built Environm Cluster,111 Renai Rd, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Dushu Lake Higher Educ Town, Room EB510,Built Environm Cluster,111 Renai Rd, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",chia-lin.chen@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Chen, Chialin/M-9190-2017","Chen, Chia-Lin/0000-0003-2308-8976",,,,,37,9,9,1,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

To partially address this gap, we construct a Chinese Patent Database linking State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) patents to all listed firms and their subsidiaries in China, and we are making the database publicly available to the research community. We first develop a computer program to match the assignee names of SIPO patents to the names of listed firms and subsidiaries based on a similarity score, taking into account unique challenges associated with Chinese firm-names and Chinese characters. High-scoring likely matches are then checked manually to determine whether they are indeed true matches. The resulting database includes 191,325 SIPO patents matched to listed firms in China from 1990 to 2010. Using this database, we find a large amount of patenting heterogeneity across firms of different geographic locations, technological foci, and ownership types. We also leverage strengths of the data to conduct a detailed analysis of the patent examination process at the SIPO. Although there is not much difference in the examination process between listed firms and their nonlisted counterparts in China, substantial differences exist between Chinese firms and foreign firms. We find that foreign firms experience substantial delay in publishing patent applications and requesting for substantive examination compared to Chinese firms. Such delay accounts for 40-60% of the longer duration from application date to decision date for foreign firms. However, after accounting for such delay, foreign firms still face much longer pendency in reaching an examination outcome (grant, withdrawal, or refusal) than Chinese firms. We hope that the public database and such analysis will encourage new streams of research on Chinese patents to improve our knowledge of China's fast-changing innovation landscape.","[He, Zi-Lin] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Tong, Tony W.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tong, Tony W.] Univ Colorado, Leeds Sch Business, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Zhang, Yuchen] Tulane Univ, Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [He, Wenlong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tilburg University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Tulane University; University of International Business & Economics,"Tong, TW (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",z.l.he@uvt.nl; tonytong@purdue.edu; yzhang54@tulane.edu; wenlong.he@uibe.edu.cn,"Tong, Tony W/E-6103-2010; Zhang, Yuchen/GYI-8858-2022","He, Zi-Lin/0000-0002-1756-9960; , Wenlong/0000-0002-6328-9767",State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272131],State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71272131) for supporting this research.

This paper tries to identify the causal effect of criminal prosecution utilizing exogenous variations over the likelihood of criminal prosecution. In 2004, a medical accident occurred in Fukushima prefecture, Japan and an obstetrician was prosecuted one year after. This prosecution exogenously changed the likelihood of criminal prosecution in Fukushima prefecture. Using difference-in-differences and synthetic control approach, we estimate the causal effect of criminal prosecution. The prosecution decreased the number of obstetricians by 13% and some of them changed their business to gynecology, which involves lower risk. However, the effect is concentrated on obstetricians, not all physicians. While the relatively weak estimates of tort liability in the literature might suggest strengthening the present sanctions, we need to be cautious about such policy. In addition, the paper shows that the sentence of acquittal did not resolve the effect caused by the initial prosecution. This illuminates the importance of criminal prosecution itself and its social sanctions, not subsequent criminal sanctions. It also highlights the importance of risk perception of physicians.

More recently the discussion about how to deliver integrated mobility has led to the emerging Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concept. MaaS is variously defined but the essential idea is to see transport or mobility not as a physical asset to purchase (e.g. a car) but as a single service available on demand and incorporating all transport services from cars to buses to rail and on-demand services. The paper's principal consideration is on how MaaS is relevant to public transport. The idea of how MaaS might be used in the Community Transport (CT) sector provides a case-study. The CT sector is unusual in providing mobility for a user group which typically does not see mobility as a physical asset to purchase. Following a review of relevant literature, the paper describes the outcome of a study with five Australian CT operators. A semi structured conversation followed by a discussion type meeting brought CEOs together to explore the concept of mobility as a service and the types of package that might be offered. Findings indicate a strong enthusiasm amongst CT operators for offering packages of mobility services to their current users and to investigate delivery of packages to non-users/new users.","[Mulley, Corinne] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies C13, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Nelson, John D.; Wright, Steve] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Engn, Ctr Transport Res, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland",University of Sydney; University of Aberdeen,"Mulley, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies C13, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au; j.d.nelson@abdn.ac.uk; s.d.wright@abdn.ac.uk,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022","Nelson, John/0000-0003-2199-7412; Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269",,,,,16,59,61,1,65,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Measurement of technical efficiency allows us to evaluate overall trends and how reforms affect production of social and environmental goods. Previous assessments have used small samples, short time periods, and viewed SOFEs as if they were profit-maximizers. We compared a traditional profit-maximization framework to an alternative social firms framework for SOFEs to classify inputs and outputs, and data envelopment analysis to measure the efficiency of 86 SOFEs from 2003 to 2009. We argue that the social firm framework is more appropriate for SOFEs given their stated objectives. We found no overall trend in pure technical efficiency over time for the social firm framework; however, there was an increase in pure technical efficiency for the profit maximization framework, consistent with past literature. At the same time, there were decreases in scale efficiency primarily due to higher levels of government investment.

In the labour market, individuals who experienced childhood poverty are found to have lower earnings and lower labour market attachment and to have worse jobs both vertically in terms of low-paying industries and horizontally in terms of job positions. In the marriage market, childhood poverty is found to have negative consequences for the probability of marriage, cohabitation, and having children around the age of 30. The effect sizes are found to exhibit an inverse u-shape in the age of the child, peaking during adolescence. Results on educational choices suggest that the mechanisms behind these results can be that childhood poverty affects the skill formation, networks, and decision making of the child.","[Lesner, Rune V.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Lesner, RV (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",rlesner@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,34,25,30,1,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

There is a paucity of literature examining the relationship between rail stations and firm locations by industry at the transit station level. This study seeks to address four questions about the effects of station proximity: 1) What is the overall distribution of firms in relation to metro station locations? 2) What industries, if any, are more likely to locate near metro stations? 3) How does the presence of a transit station affect firm relocation within the region? 4) Does a new transit station result in a net gain of firms within the station proximity and for the region through the relocation process? This study examines the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) dataset for Washington, DC and its suburbs in Maryland, which contains longitudinal and cross-sectional firm-level data and firm-level relocation data for the years 1990-2010. This study contributes to the literature on the effect of transit investment and TOD on economic development by suggesting future research agendas based on the descriptive analysis results, particularly addressing the question of net effects for locations beyond the immediate station area.

Executive condominiums (ECs), introduced to provide affordable housing for middle-class citizens, are subject to restrictions on transferability in the first 10 years, unlike private condominiums (PCs). As per the option theory, EC buyers have the forward-start American put option with the right to sell their properties only after the contract date. Among transacted units matched by location, completion and transaction dates, and complex- and unit-level characteristics, we find that prices of new ECs are about 21 percent lower than those of PCs. After the 10th year, when property rights restrictions are completely removed, the price gap between ECs and PCs narrows to about 3 percent. These results suggest that property rights restrictions and illiquidity generated by the forward-start American put option for 10 years results in an 18 percent discount.","[Lee, Kwan Ok; Ooi, Joseph T.

To be effective, organisational leaders must possess the right competencies. One vital leadership competency is strategic thinking, which is described as the ability to synthesise and utilise intuition and creativity in order for an organisation to achieve an integrated perspective. Strategic thinking remains a critical area for research, owing to lack of supporting empirical literature, and to theories that give little or no guidance to leaders. Aim: The purpose of this study is to empirically test the relationship between strategic thinking competency and leadership effectiveness in Kenyan indigenous banks. Setting: The setting of the study is the indigenous banks in Kenya. Methods: The study was based on a positivist research paradigm which is quantitative in nature and utilised a survey method to collect data. Both probability and non-probability methods were used to determine the target population. The research instrument was a self-administered, closed-ended questionnaire. From a target population of 494 individuals, a total of 257 responses were received and analysed. The analysis was performed using structural equation modelling with confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha and goodness-of-fit indices being used for analysis and testing relationships. Results: The overall findings are that a positive relationship exists between strategic thinking and leadership effectiveness in indigenous banks in Kenya. The study further establishes positive relationships between the strategic thinking competency and its sub-constructs of general strategic thinking, intent-focused and hypothesis-driven, but a negative relationship with intelligent opportunism. A similar positive relationship exists between leadership effectiveness and its sub-constructs of influence, follower commitment and versatility. Conclusion: This research has established that strategic thinking is an important determinant of leadership effectiveness for indigenous banks in Kenya, and therefore supports prevailing literature and theory indicating a positive relationship. The implication of the study is that bank management should strive to maintain strategic thinking competency for effective leadership, successful bank performance and stability.","[Muriithi, Samuel M.] Daystar Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Commerce, Nairobi, Kenya; [Louw, Lynette] Rhodes Univ, Dept Management, Grahamstown, South Africa; [Radloff, Sarah E.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Stat, Grahamstown, South Africa",Daystar University; Rhodes University; Rhodes University,"Muriithi, SM (通讯作者)，Daystar Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Commerce, Nairobi, Kenya.",smuriithi@daystar.ac.ke,"Muriithi, Samuel/AAM-3237-2020; Louw, Lynette/G-8238-2017","Muriithi, Samuel/0000-0002-0635-8092; Louw, Lynette/0000-0001-7837-6604",,,,,61,5,10,4,30,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Sweden's national transport policy also has elements of this shift, most noticeable in the so-called four step principle, where the possibility to affect the need for transport and choice of transport mode (step 1) and the possibility to use existing infrastructure more efficiently (step 2) should be considered before large reconstructions (step 3) or new infrastructure (step 4) is chosen as the solution to transport related problems. The aim of this article is to study whether the practical implications of Swedish national transport policy are consistent with the ambitions expressed in the four step principle, with particular focus on the Swedish Transport Administration's (STA) mandate to finance different measures. Based on an analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews the main finding of the analysis is that many step 1 and 2 measures do not fall within the financial mandate of the STA. The implementation of the four step principle therefore depends on the commitment among other actors than the STA to implement step 1 and 2 measures. Furthermore, it is concluded that the limits to the STA mandate has consequences for the ability of the STA to engage in collaboration with the actors on which it depends, and that strengthening the STA's mandate to finance a desired function rather than physical infrastructure is likely to increase commitment among other stakeholders to work with these measures. Such a step would imply a different regulatory framework than the current, more in line with the sustainable mobility paradigm (Banister 2008) and could contribute to a good accessibility to different amenities at the same time as negative environmental impacts are reduced.","[Johansson, Fredrik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Div Strateg Sustainabil Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tornberg, Patrik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, Div Urban & Reg Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tornberg, Patrik; Fernstrom, Astrid] WSP, Arenavagen 7, SE-12188 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Johansson, F (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Div Strateg Sustainabil Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",frjo6@kth.se; patrik.tornberg@abe.kth.se; Astrid.Fernstrom@wspgroup.se,"Johansson, Fredrik/GPX-2261-2022","Johansson, Fredrik/0000-0001-5838-7111",STA,STA,"The authors would like to thank Anna Kramers and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on a previous version of this paper.

However, it remains unclear what exactly start-up communities are and how they can be facilitated. Ambiguity concerning the geographical scale and membership of start-up communities leads to different conceptualisations. In this paper, we apply communities of practice (CoP) theory to understand how conceptualisations of start-up communities work and how they can be facilitated. To this end, we qualitatively study start-up communities in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, Australia. Our results show that start-up communities that are confined to a particular workspace strongly resemble a CoP. Furthermore, many elements of CoPs can also be found in regional start-up communities. Finally, we find that workspace communities have more direct and top-down facilitation activities, while regional start-up communities have more indirect and bottom-up facilitation activities.","[van Weele, Marijn A.; Steinz, Henk J.; van Rijnsoever, Frank J.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Rijnsoever, Frank J.] Univ Politecn Valencia, INGENIO, CSIC, Valencia, Netherlands; [van Rijnsoever, Frank J.] Heidelberglaan 2,Room 10-04b, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"van Weele, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.a.vanweele@uu.nl; h.j.steinz@uu.nl; f.j.vanrijnsoever@uu.nl,"van Rijnsoever, Frank J/L-6628-2013",,,,,,60,18,19,4,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Although there is ample evidence confirming the predicted positive incentive effect of sanctions, it has also been shown that imposing sanctions may reduce compliance by crowding out intrinsic motivation. We add to the literature on the hidden costs of control by showing that these costs are restricted to situations where the principal actively chooses to sanction low performance and where this choice is known to the agent. In such a situation, the principal's commitment to sanction low performance might indicate that she or he is a distrustful type and hence conveys a negative signal. To the contrary, if (a) an agent is not informed about whether low performance will be sanctioned or if (b) the computer determines whether low performance will be sanctioned, the principal's type is not revealed, and we find no evidence of crowding out.","[Klempt, Charlotte] Inst Appl Econ Res, Ob Himmelreich 1, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Pull, Kerstin] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Klempt, C (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res, Ob Himmelreich 1, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",charlotte.klempt@iaw.edu,"Pull, Kerstin/AEA-1913-2022","Pull, Kerstin/0000-0002-7682-3703",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Debate is ongoing whether the liberalization of the single-child policy to a two-child policy can mitigate China's aging problems without unacceptably increasing the population. The purpose of this paper is to apply machine learning theory to the demographic field and project China's population structure under different fertility policies. The population data employed derive from the fifth and sixth national census records obtained in 2000 and 2010 in addition to the annals published by the China National Bureau of Statistics. Firstly, the sex ratio at birth is estimated according to the total fertility rate based on least squares regression of time series data. Secondly, the age-specific fertility rates and age-specific male/female mortality rates are projected by a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) model, which then serve as the input to a Leslie matrix model. Finally, the male/female age-specific population data projected by the Leslie matrix in a given year serve as the input parameters of the Leslie matrix for the following year, and the process is iterated in this manner until reaching the target year. The experimental results reveal that the proposed LS-SVM-Leslie model improves the projection accuracy relative to the conventional Leslie matrix model in terms of the percentage error and mean algebraic percentage error. The results indicate that the total fertility ratio should be controlled to around 2.0 to balance concerns associated with a large population with concerns associated with an aging population. Therefore, the two-child birth policy should be fully instituted in China. However, the fertility desire of women tends to be low due to the high cost of living and the pressure associated with employment, particularly in the metropolitan areas. Thus additional policies should be implemented to encourage fertility.","[Li, Shuang; Yang, Zewei] Wuhan Univ, Int Sch Software, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shu, Guangwen] South Cent Univ Nationalities, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Wuhan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; South Central Minzu University","Shu, GW (通讯作者)，South Cent Univ Nationalities, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",shuguangwen@whu.edu.cn,"li, hs/HNI-7007-2023; li, he/ISB-4278-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41421001],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41421001",,26,6,10,5,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

The factors under focus are wages, organizational culture, benefits, job satisfaction, stress, training and development, promotion prospects, and job security. The study measures the impact of each factor on employee satisfaction. The research population is the body of employees in Jordan's industrial sector, with a random sample of industrial employees representing the population. The quantitative method is used to examine the research question. The study found that Jordanian employees care the most about their salaries and position more than any other factors. Therefore, we recommend that Jordanian manufactures consider studying the range of salary for each position, so they do not miss out on talented people or lose a good employee.","[Abuhashesh, Mohammd] PSUT, E Mkt & Social Media Dept, Amman, Jordan; [Al-Dmour, Rand; Masa'deh, Ra'ed] Univ Jordan, Sch Business, Management Informat Syst, Amman, Jordan",University of Jordan,"Abuhashesh, M (通讯作者)，PSUT, E Mkt & Social Media Dept, Amman, Jordan.",m.abuhashesh@psut.edu.jo; Rand.aldmour@ju.edu.jo; r.masadeh@ju.edu.jo,"Abuhashesh, Mohammad/AAF-9777-2021; Masa'deh, Ra'ed/J-4574-2016; Al-dmour, Rand/V-3423-2018","Masa'deh, Ra'ed/0000-0002-9070-3732; Al-dmour, Rand/0000-0003-3280-0224; Abuhashesh, Mohammad/0000-0001-7460-450X",,,,,43,1,1,1,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4285,4305,,,,,,21,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205033,0

Panel data was utilized for 39 African countries. The results indicate that the inflow of FDI has not closed the investment and foreign exchange gaps of the selected host African countries, rather has become wider unlike what is obtainable in other developing regions of the world like Asia. The study concludes by recommending that government of host economies should carefully select sector of FDI inflow to be such as will impact on domestic investment, and not just capital intensive resource exploitation which often crowd out domestic investment. Also, policies should be put in place to encourage domestic investment, industrialisation, to enable the region to be more producing inclined rather than consuming and hence, improving balance of payment position. These will gradually aid in closing both investment and foreign exchange gaps alike, thereby, bringing about vibrant economic activities, increased investment and the desired development in the region.","[Adegboye, Folasade Bosede; Akinjare, Victoria Abosede; Olokoyo, Felicia Omowunmi] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria; [Ojeka, Stephen Aanu] Covenant Univ, Dept Accounting, Ota, Nigeria",Covenant University; Covenant University,"Adegboye, FB (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria.",folasade.adegboye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; stephen.ojeka@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; victoria.akinjare@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,,,Covenant University,Covenant University,Our acknowledgement goes to Covenant University for the sponsor of this research work.

By using descriptive analysis techniques the results of the study show that (1) most of the fishermen in West Sumatera used outboard motor boats and with a dominant operating period of only 1 day. From the production techniques used by the fisherman, it is more traditional and small-scale with an average crew of less than 5 people who use motorboats, outboard motorboats and motorized boats. And also the fishermen are more dominant in using their own capital for fishing because of the difficulty to access capital in the banks. Furthermore, from the production side, West Sumatra's marine fishery production is sold directly to the market and only few fishermen sell processed fish of the fish they catch. Whereas, in terms of age, most of the fishermen are in the age of 30 - 49 years old who graduated from elementary school. 2).

Moreover, we demonstrate that the likelihood of a price dispersion outcome is reduced when consumers with limited memory set up the price categories optimally.

This study examines the increase in the procurement price needed to keep tax revenue constant in the face of a 50% reduction in the tax rate. This compensative effect is important because reductions in the tax rate are contemplated and tobacco tax revenue is a major source of funding for rural communities. Based on an equilibrium-displacement model of China's tobacco sector, results suggest the Compensated Effect Elasticity (CEE) is between 1.0 and 2.5. This means a 50% cut in the tax rate would necessitate an increase in the procurement price of between 50% and 125%. Sensitivity analysis indicates CEE is most sensitive to the retail demand and input substitution elasticities and least sensitive to oligopoly power and returns to scale.","[Cai, Hailong; Xiao, Yitian] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 17 Qinghuadonglu Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Cai, HL (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 17 Qinghuadonglu Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",caihlmail@cau.edu.cn; xyt@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,10,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Abruptly dynamic environment is characterized by low-frequency, substantial magnitude, and high-degree irregularity of change. Utilizing 168 listed electronics firms in Taiwan as the sample, this study incorporated the context of the 2008 global financial crisis as a naturally quasi-experimental setting and adopted a less investigated performance metric, firm resilient performance, to investigate how the two most researched types of TMT job-related diversity (i.e., educational and functional diversity) influence firm resilience in such environments. The results suggest that in abruptly dynamic environments, TMT job-related diversity negatively influences firms' resilient performance, and TMT longevity significantly moderates this relationship. This study makes unique contributions to the upper-echelons literature by investigating the effect of TMT diversity in a naturally quasi-experimental setting featuring abrupt environmental dynamism.","[Chen, Wein-Hong] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Hualien, Taiwan; [Liu, Yi-Yuan] Oriental Inst Technol, Dept Mkt & Distribut Management, Taipei, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University; Asia Eastern University of Science & Technology,"Chen, WH (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Hualien, Taiwan.",weinhong@gms.ndhu.edu.tw,,,Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 104-2410-H-259-079],Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology,This work was supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology under Grant#MOST 104-2410-H-259-079.,,68,2,2,4,53,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Based on a cross-industry survey of 201 Asian firms, we find that the effectiveness of firm capabilities and open innovation activities is contingent on the level of environmental dynamism. Specifically, when the level of environmental dynamism increases, inbound activities, network capabilities, and innovation capabilities are able to enhance radical innovation. In addition, the level of environmental dynamism moderates the effect of network capabilities on both inbound and outbound activities in creating radical innovation, but not so with the effect of innovation capabilities. Overall, this study contributes to the open innovation literature by shedding light on important complementarities between inbound/outbound activities and specific types of firm-enabled capabilities (network and innovation) under conditions of environmental dynamism.","[Cheng, Colin C.

Understanding the perceptions is important in order to find out the success of entrepreneurial education as it can be a basis to evaluate the development of the course. To find out the perception, as many as 39 respondents were involved to give their opinion towards the entrepreneurial education they received. The questionnaire was used as a tool to explore these perceptions. The aspects of education in question are: entrepreneurship material, motivation, entrepreneurial skills, approaches, facilitators, and entrepreneurial programs/activities. The results of the descriptive analysis of the distribution of questionnaires showed that students have a positive perception of entrepreneurship education they received.

Nowadays, innovativeness is one of the most crucial factors accelerating economic growth. Increasing innovativeness is particularly important for developing countries, where policymakers are implementing various innovation strategies. The Europe 2020 strategy sets the target of 3% GDP for R&D spending. Many studies emphasize a significant effect of increasing expenditures on R&D on economic growth, but an efficiency aspect has not been covered in the literature. The article is based on critical review of the main literature of the subject and own empirical studies. The statistical data is sourced from the main international statistics. Calculations were performed using DEA methodology. DEA methodology allows assessing input-output efficiency. Inputs indicator is the annual public and private spending on R&D (as % GDP). There are nine output indicators, which represent available innovative statistics about number of patents, high-tech production etc. Number of variables was reduced for each period using correlation coefficient analysis, which allowed identifying the significant variables with least loss of information. The efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the weighted sum of the outputs by the weighted sum of inputs. The calculations are carried out based on the Excel spreadsheet and DEAFrontier. The paper gives a general review of the innovation level in CEE countries compared to other EU members which are spending less than 2% of GDP on R&D. The analysis shows that among CEE countries, the closest to efficiency frontier are Romania and Slovakia. Hypothesis that increasing spending on innovations is not causing proportional effects has been confirmed for CEE region, but not for western economies, which are spending on R& D more effectively. Main conclusion of the research is that innovation spending should be increased gradually in aim to achieve optimal results. This research may contribute to discussion on innovation policy design, and can be used by policy makers to develop national innovation strategies.","[Dobrzanski, Pawel] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ, 118-120 Komandorska St, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Dobrzanski, P (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ, 118-120 Komandorska St, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",pawel.dobrzanski@ue.wroc.pl,"Dobrzański, Paweł/T-5883-2018","Dobrzański, Paweł/0000-0002-3137-7797",,,,,38,16,16,0,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

In cases where investors are faced with options without known probabilities, they tend to choose an option that will guarantee the most negligible loss. When faced with a diminutive loss, the investors will try to avoid these losses, even if that means exposing more resources to potential losses. Average down investment strategy can help to overcome losses faster while risking large amounts of resources, thus, showing investors' propensity for loss-aversion. However, stock trading under ambiguity is not rational behavior, and is closer to gambling than investing, even when faced with losses. The choice of average down as investment strategy can explain the effect that dominates during investment decision-making process when losses occur due to ambiguity. This paper presents the results of a research conducted in order to determine if investors will use average down strategy when there is a lack of information on the market, and the size of the loss when they will be willing to use it. Obtained results show strong probability of average down usage among the subject group, thus proving aversion to a sure loss. The relation between risk aversion and aversion to a sure loss is tested. The results show that there is no influence of risk aversion on choice to use average down investment strategy. The results and possible applications of the research are thoroughly discussed.","[Ferencak, Miroslav; Dobromirov, Dusan; Radisic, Mladen] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Takaci, Aleksandar] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Technol, Bul Cara Lazara 1, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Ferencak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",ferencak@uns.ac.rs; ddobromirov@uns.ac.rs; mladenr@uns.ac.rs; stakaci@uns.ac.rs,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The effectiveness of this stage was evaluated as the alignment between the incubator desired profile and the companies entrepreneurial orientation. Although innovativeness was perceived as the main characteristic, the survival-of-the-fittest strategy was more evident. The entrepreneurial orientation offers a set of relevant selection criteria because it expands the term weak-but-promise into better-defined concepts and relates to the existing incubation literature. Therefore, this analysis presents a more structured approach to effectiveness evaluation of selection process, opening the incubator black box.

The survey made it possible to identify the main personal qualities of a specialist in human resource management. The conducted study of the concordance between personal qualities of students and the requirements to the personnel manager showed inconsistencies in a number of basic characteristics. The choice of diagnostic tools is justified by efficiency requirements from the university in professional development and career support of students. The research methodology is based on a survey and computer analysis using a multivariate personality questionnaire. The research concept is based on the theory of career self-efficacy and the theory of leading trends. The identified empirical data of personal qualities of students allowed to determine a set of activities for career support for university students, taking into account the level of their psychological and professional development.

This public good can be regarded as a service, as it is co-delivered based on the development of multiple network and partner relationships. In explaining what social innovations are and how they are delivered, much research emphasises the role of NGOs and community-based collective action. This article starts by observing that universities can play various roles in social innovation, then theoretically explains how and why universities are involved in providing this public good. These roles have been neglected with the recent emphasis on university commercialisation, for example, via patents and start-ups. We use this insight to propose a conceptual framework for understanding how and why universities can organise the co-delivery of social innovations through education. This framework is illustrated with a case study, leading to propositions for later research.","[McKelvey, Maureen; Zaring, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"McKelvey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden.",maureen.mckelvey@handels.gu.se,,"McKelvey, Maureen/0000-0002-1457-7922",Sten A.

A tax advantage, also called a tax shield, affects four interconnected components of financial performance: profit, cash flow, profitability and the value of business. Traditionally, the value of tax shield is associated with the issue of capital structure and the value of business. In this paper, we examined the impact of the tax shield (tax advantage) on corporate profitability. As a suitable method, an extended DuPont analysis has been chosen to distinguish five ratios affecting ROE: tax-effect ratio, financial cost ratio, operating profit margin, asset turnover and equity multiplier. The aim of the paper is to analyse the impact of the total tax shield on ROE by deviation analysis. Multi-period deviation analysis has been used because tax benefits have a long-term effect on the profitability of an enterprise. At the same time, two period deviation analysis was used to assess the development trend of the impact of the tax shield. The analysis results show that the tax effect represented by the tax effect ratio has a relatively low overall impact on the profitability of the analysed enterprise. On the other hand, deviation analysis should be interpreted with regard to the business and macroeconomic environment. In this regard, four major factors in the Slovak Republic were found: the change in the rules on depreciation of fixed assets, the change in the rules of loss carry forward, changes in the corporate tax rate and the decrease in interest rates.","[Michalkova, Lucia; Kliestik, Tomas; Kovacova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina, Slovakia; [Radisic, Mladen] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Nica, Elvira] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Adm & Publ Management, Bucharest, Romania",University of Zilina; University of Novi Sad; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Michalkova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Zilina, Slovakia.",lucia.michalkova@fpedas.uniza.sk; tomas.kliestik@fpedas.uniza.sk; maria.kovacova@fpedas.uniza.sk; mladen.ftn@gmail.com; popescu_elvira@yahoo.com,"Michalkova, Lucia/P-6098-2015; Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015; Nica, Elvira/ADG-5173-2022; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015","Michalkova, Lucia/0000-0002-3072-7396; Nica, Elvira/0000-0002-7383-2161; Kovacova, Maria/0000-0003-2081-6835; Kliestik, Tomas/0000-0002-3815-5409",[Vega 1/0428/17],,The paper is an output of the science project Vega 1/0428/17 Creation of new paradigms of financial management at the threshold of the 21st century in conditions of the Slovak republic.,,22,1,1,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,8114,8126,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553209010,0

We will not be considering whether or not sustainability should be a policy objective. That is the sort of ethical question that other previous paper addressed. Here we will take it as given that sustainability is desirable, that it is agreed that the current human generation should take account of the interests of future human generations. The first question that then arises is: what are the interests of future generations? The next question then is: how do we look after those interests? This second question itself involves two stages. First, we deal with identifying current policy objectives that look after future interests. Second, we deal with devising policy instruments to achieve those objectives. But this paper deals mainly with mapping the interests of future generations into current policy objectives and it addresses questions about instruments only in a very general way.

Manufacturing is an integral of the industrial sector necessary for rapid growth of an economy. To achieve a vibrant and robust manufacturing sub-sector, strong economic fundamentals are basic requirements. This paper estimates the impact of key macroeconomic indicators on manufacturing performance in Nigeria over the period 1975-2015. Manufacturing capacity utilization is adopted as proxy for manufacturing performance while exchange rate, lending rate, inflation rate, external debt-GDP ratio, terms of trade and trade openness are selected exogenous variables. The vector autoregressive analytical technique is adopted. The variance decomposition result shows that variations in manufacturing capacity utilization in Nigeria are largely driven by shocks to its lagged values. The result further shows strong positive impact of trade openness on manufacturing capacity utilization. The study therefore concludes that manufacturing performance in Nigeria is partly driven by shocks to own innovations and partly by trade policy shocks. The study recommends introduction of trade, economic and industrial development policies that support systematic and sustainable improvement in manufacturing capacity utilization to enhance manufacturing performance.","[Okoye, Lawrence Uchenna; Olokoyo, Felicia O.; Achugamonu, Uzoma B.] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria; [Ezeji, Felix N.] Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Abakaliki, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Okoye, LU (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria.",lawrence.okoye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; felixezeji67@gmail.com; uzoma.achugamonu@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,,"Achugamonu, Uzoma/0000-0003-3797-7686","Covenant University Ota, Nigeria","Covenant University Ota, Nigeria","The authors duly appreciate Covenant University Ota, Nigeria, for the full sponsorship of their participation at the conference.",,91,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6467,6483,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207045,0

The framework has inspired and informed empirical studies in several contexts, contributing to our understanding of the dynamics of dyadic collaborations, industrial clusters and districts, and regional innovation systems, to name but a few. Recent conceptual and empirical advances have called attention to the role of personal proximity and social proximity in such collaborations. In addition to other forms of proximity, these two dimensions could make up the glue that holds knowledge networks together. In the introduction to this special issue, we elaborate upon this proposition, setting out a point-of-departure for the three empirical studies collected in this issue.

Positive organizational psychology and existential authenticity literature was analysed to examine the constructs of authentic leadership and leader-follower relationship, the effects of authentic leaders on followers, as well as personal and organizational challenges authentic leaders face constructing authenticity and building authentic relationships within organization. The qualitative research with authentic leaders and their followers was conducted to examine the genesis of emergent authentic leader follower relationships within organization. The literature review and the empirical research results reveal that both positive organizational psychology and existential authenticity approaches must be applied to accurately define the concept of authentic leadership and to disclose the genesis of leader-follower relationships. Authentic leader-follower relationship genesis consists of: leader's conscious self-development, self-awareness and awareness of follower impact on his/her authentic personality, congruence of leader's and follower's values regarding work behaviour, and leader's willingness to build authentic relationships. Authentic leaders form the relationships by performing unconditional trust, by communicating directly and transparently, by discovering and communicating meaning, by focusing on followers' development. With its strong focus on how followers perceive leader's individual and relational authenticity, the research contributes to the development of authentic leadership measurement.","[Petkeviciute, Nijole] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Management, Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Barvydiene, Violeta; Surpikiene, Nastasija] ISM Univ Management & Econ, Execut Sch, Arkliu Str 18, LT-01129 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; ISM University of Management & Economics,"Petkeviciute, N (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Dept Management, Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",nijole.petkeviciute@vdu.lt; viobar@ism.lt; surpnast@stud.ism.lt,"Petkevičiūtė, Nijolė/GXF-8760-2022","Petkevičiūtė, Nijolė/0000-0002-3281-9411",,,,,54,4,7,4,44,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The original contribution of this paper is that it captures the time variation and nonlinearities of the relationship between variables taking into account food price volatility and its macroeconomic implications. The main findings of the paper are: (i) high global food prices were transmitted to domestic economies causing pressure on inflation in the long run; (ii) in the short run the impact of a positive shock in international food price increases domestic inflation, depreciates the currency and reduces the agricultural trade; (iii) the vulnerabilities to global food prices are more pregnant for Romania and Bulgaria; (iv) the difference in the transmission of world prices is related to the different status of the countries as regards food and agricultural trade. The findings of the research would be significant for the governments to promote policies to help farmers respond to the rising of food prices by growing more and responding to export opportunities that may arise.","[Saman, Corina] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Saman, Corina; Alexandri, Cecilia] Romanian Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Saman, C (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania.;Saman, C (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",csaman@ipe.ro,"Saman, Corina/AAC-7452-2020","Saman, Corina/0000-0002-5855-7771",,,,,33,5,5,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Delay payments make a rapid chain reaction in business, when a lack of liquidity forces them to resort to austerity measures that, of course, nobody knows. Delayed payments affect not only business liquidity, but the increasing rate of bad debts hinders planned growth, increases administrative and financial burdens. In the case of businesses and customers from different Member States, they also negatively affect the cross-border trade itself. All of this, in the end, has a negative impact on the entire European economy. The willingness of Slovak companies to provide business loans to their business partners is largely determined by the development of payment discipline, so we decided to analyse the payment discipline using the aggregation method k-means on a sample of 9,067 selected Slovak companies.","[Siekelova, Anna] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Lazaroiu, George] Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania",University of Zilina; Spiru Haret University,"Siekelova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",anna.siekelova@fpedas.uniza.sk; phd_lazaroiu@yahoo.com,"Siekelova, Anna/P-5595-2015; Lazaroiu, George/AAX-2926-2021; Lazaroiu, George/A-2262-2015","Siekelova, Anna/0000-0001-6571-8476;",project titled Creation of new paradigms of financial management at the threshold of the 21st century in conditions of the Slovak republic of Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA [VEGA 1/0428/17],project titled Creation of new paradigms of financial management at the threshold of the 21st century in conditions of the Slovak republic of Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA,The research leading to these results has received funding from the project titled Creation of new paradigms of financial management at the threshold of the 21st century in conditions of the Slovak republic in the frame of the program of Slovak Scientific Grant Agency VEGA under the grant agreement number VEGA 1/0428/17,,22,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7407,7417,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208039,0

This followed the discovery that the number of newborns in Slovakia suffering from congenital heart diseases has increased over the recent years, and in the period between 2002 and 2012 annually 451 children at an average are born with this congenital disorder. Another factor that prompted our research was that the diseases of the circulatory system are rated among the most frequent cause of hospitalization and mortality in Slovakia, as confirmed by the International Classification of Diseases or the ICD (the international equivalent of the Slovak MKCH-10). Accordingly, people suffering from cardiovascular diseases belong to the most-frequently hospitalized patients. The third finding we have arrived at is the high level of consumption of prescription medicines by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification, again dominated by cardio-vascular diseases. The paper describes both the cardio-vascular diseases and the hospital facilities specialized in their treatment, assessing their efficiency in evaluating the major factors affecting them. The evaluation is carried out based on financial ratios and application of prediction models.

Based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) data and the method developed by Koopman, Powers, Wang, and Wei (KPWW), the study measured and calculated the employment rates and wages for high, medium, and low skilled labour in 40 countries worldwide by deconstructing the added value of input-output data from 14 industries from 1995 to 2011. Then, the competitiveness of China's manufacturing industry was evaluated with respect to high-end technological innovation capability and low-end wage cost. The empirical results show that the magnitude of high-end talent expansion and quality improvement in China's manufacturing industry is larger than in Europe, the United States, Japan, demonstrating that China's manufacturing industry is not experiencing low-end locking. The competitive advantages of China's manufacturing industry change from the low cost of low-skilled labour to the low cost of middle and high-end labour.

The methodology of the study, in particular, the retrospective analysis, the systematic approach to assessing the main stages and results of the political process, and the generalization of the experience of democratic reforms, has made it possible to assert that the prospects of Ukraine moving from a state of democratic transition to real democracy directly depend on the quality and scale of the implementation of democratic instruments in the daily life of the society and administrative practices of the authorities. The strategy of strengthening the state's participation in solving complex socio-economic tasks is based on the tasks of association with civil society on the principles of delegation of powers and expansion of the competence of local authorities in the narrowing of the echelons of public administration at the regional level. The peculiarities of the public administration system development and the prolongation of the democratic transit of Ukraine were stipulated by the young democracy, the relative weakness of democratic traditions and political elite, the ineffectiveness of corrupt courts, the manually controlled economy, the political process, which was distorted by the influence of money and destructive forces, superseding rational argumentation by the mercantile compromises with the law. Democratic reforms, which are actively pursued by the Ukrainian authorities in the difficult conditions of the hybrid war, take place in a situation that has changed significantly. Institutional processes are gaining in the systemic character, civil society in Ukraine is developing an experience of interaction with the authorities at all stages of managerial activity. Democratic practices are spreading in Ukrainian society, which defines Ukraine as one of the most potential democratic countries of our time.","[Zahorskyi, Volodymyr; Lipentsev, Andriy; Andreyeva, Svitlana] Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Lviv Reg Inst Publ Adm, Lvov, Ukraine",National Academy of Public Administration under the President of Ukraine,"Zahorskyi, V (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Lviv Reg Inst Publ Adm, Lvov, Ukraine.",zahorskyi@ukr.net; lipen1@ukr.net; saclviv@gmail.com,"Andreyeva, Svetlana/AAQ-9613-2021; Lipentsev, Andriy/AAL-7131-2020; Zahorskyi, Volodymyr/AAH-3646-2019","Andreyeva, Svetlana/0000-0003-3635-4209; Zahorskyi, Volodymyr/0000-0003-3260-3271",,,,,16,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2289,2296,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203037,0

Public opinion on this cross-border migration is decidedly hostile. According to a 2013 opinion poll, more than three-fifths of the adult population would favour closing the border. Can civic and ethnic identifications with the nation explain this opposition to immigration? Using data from the 12th (2013) round of the cross-sectional South African Social Attitudes Survey (N= 2,739) this paper was able to investigate individual attitudes towards border control. This paper investigates different dimensions of national identity. The results revealed that ethnic national attachment was an important determinant of attitudes towards border control. Such attitudes were also associated with attitudes towards immigrant assimilation and the effect of nationalism on society. For those aiming to ameliorate public sentiment on border control, this study provides a test of multiple determinants of public opinion on the issue, examining the comparative strength of each.","[Gordon, Steven Lawrence] HSRC, Democracy Governance & Serv Delivery Res Programm, Atrium 5th Floor,430 Peter Mokaba St, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa",Human Sciences Research Council-South Africa,"Gordon, SL (通讯作者)，HSRC, Democracy Governance & Serv Delivery Res Programm, Atrium 5th Floor,430 Peter Mokaba St, ZA-4001 Durban, South Africa.",sgordon@hsrc.ac.za,"Gordon, Steven Lawrence/S-1742-2018","Gordon, Steven Lawrence/0000-0002-6393-2118","Open Society Foundation South Africa (OSF-SA) through its South African Foreign Policy Initiative (SAFPI) [0322]; South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS) a programme within the Democracy Governance and Service Delivery research programme, Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC)","Open Society Foundation South Africa (OSF-SA) through its South African Foreign Policy Initiative (SAFPI); South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS) a programme within the Democracy Governance and Service Delivery research programme, Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC)","The data presented in this article was supported by Grant 0322 from the Open Society Foundation South Africa (OSF-SA) through its South African Foreign Policy Initiative (SAFPI).

The lower level of agricultural productivity resulting in the inability to obtain a sufficient level of production in agriculture leads rural communities to exert pressure on forest resources while damaging the ecological services provided by them. Promotion of economic efficiency as well as achieving environmentally sustainable farming practices can help maintain a sustainable agricultural sector while reducing land degradation and pressure on forests in rural communities. In this context this study investigates the relationships between different indicators of agricultural biodiversity (crop diversity, livestock diversity and agro-diversity) and farm level technical efficiency (TE). A survey conducted covering 723 farms in Sri Lanka is used for the analysis. The results show that crop diversity, livestock diversity and agro diversity are positively related with farm level TE. Hence, it is clear that maintaining more diverse farming systems is crucial to reducing farm level inefficiency and thereby improving the welfare of rural households while reducing the pressure on extensive agricultural practices which has increased global deforestation. Such diversity is especially important for subsistence agricultural practices which are still widespread in most Asian countries.

While this might lead to more flexible labour markets, there are potential downsides for individuals. We explore the prevalence of atypical work in Ireland which provides a fascinating case study. Ireland experienced a dramatic deterioration in its labour market around the Great Recession with unemployment rising from 4.8 per cent in 2007 to 15 per cent in 2012. This situation was also reversed somewhat quickly with unemployment falling to 8 per cent by 2016. Such dramatic swings provide the context in which we explore whether atypical work increased for new job holders with the onset of recession and whether or not this weakened as the economy recovered. We find that atypical work did increase with the recession and, although moderating, the likelihood of new jobs being atypical persisted into the recovery. This raises important questions about whether economic recovery alone will improve job quality, in addition to job numbers.","[Kelly, Elish] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Kelly, Elish] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Barrett, Alan] Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Barrett, Alan] Inst Labour Studies IZA, Bonn, Germany",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kelly, E (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Kelly, E (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",IAish.Kelly@esri.ie,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

In this paper, we use soil sealing datasets derived from the European Environment Agency in order to estimate the expansion of built-up areas in the North and South Aegean islands in Greece. We examine these differences in relation to socio-economic features of the islands, especially tourism development, second home development and size and geographical position of the islands. The findings show divergent levels of soil sealing and a variety of spatial configurations, such as scattered growth of built-up land in coastal areas and peri-urban growth in rural areas. Higher cover of the total area of islands by sealed soil is related to tourism, but it seems that second homes are also an important driver, especially for smaller islands located relatively close to Athens. From a planning and management perspective, these findings can assist local or regional administration to assess the effectiveness of land use management plans and manage flows and processes.","[Kizos, Thanasis; Tsilimigkas, Georgios; Karampela, Sofia] Univ Aegean, Dept Geog, Mitilini 81100, University Hill, Greece",University of Aegean,"Kizos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Dept Geog, Mitilini 81100, University Hill, Greece.",akizos@aegean.gr; gtsil@geo.aegean.gr; karampela@env.aegean.gr,"Karampela, Sofia/Q-2023-2019; Kizos, Thanasis`/AAV-1026-2020; Kizos, Thanasis/B-9560-2014","Karampela, Sofia/0000-0002-4016-3424; Kizos, Thanasis`/0000-0002-1526-0919; TSILIMIGKAS, Georgios/0000-0002-2061-9703","Integrated Programme for Island Research (IPIR) of the Program: 'The University of the Aegean, the prominent and driving factor for the economic and social growth of the wide Aegean area' of the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning'; European Union (European Social Fund); National Resources","Integrated Programme for Island Research (IPIR) of the Program: 'The University of the Aegean, the prominent and driving factor for the economic and social growth of the wide Aegean area' of the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning'; European Union (European Social Fund)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); National Resources","Part of this work of this paper was supported by the Integrated Programme for Island Research (IPIR) of the Program: 'The University of the Aegean, the prominent and driving factor for the economic and social growth of the wide Aegean area' of the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning', which is co-funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and National Resources.

Daily returns for a set of stock market indexes are predicted over about 13 years from the early 2000s. We find that Bayesian predictive densities improve the VaR backtest at the 1% risk level for single models and for linear and log pools. We also find that the robust VaR backtest exhibited by linear and log pools is better than the backtest of single models at the 5% risk level.

The theoretical framework imbeds geography into the concept of spatial decay in the provision of public services and our empirical estimation employs a panel data set for 94 countries for the period 1970-2010. Following the 'first nature' geography literature we construct a geographical fragmentation index based on elevation data and find that geographical fragmentation and area are significantly and positively related to fiscal decentralization. Following the 'second nature' geography literature we interact the geographical fragmentation index with time variant infrastructure variables, in order to test the effect that infrastructure and communications have on physical geography and fiscal decentralization. While the development of infrastructure tends to reduce the effect of physical geography on decentralization, this effect is rather small and mostly statistically insignificant.","[Canavire-Bacarreza, Gustavo] Univ EAFIT, Sch Econ & Finance, Medellin, Colombia; [Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Int Ctr Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Universidad EAFIT; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Canavire-Bacarreza, G (通讯作者)，Univ EAFIT, Sch Econ & Finance, Medellin, Colombia.",gcanavir@eafit.edu.co,"Yedgenov, Bauyrzhan/ABH-0582-2022; Yedgenov, Bauyrzhan/AAR-5096-2020; Canavire-Bacarreza, Gustavo/AAJ-4856-2020","Yedgenov, Bauyrzhan/0000-0001-6625-4554; Yedgenov, Bauyrzhan/0000-0001-6625-4554;",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37572],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We are very thankful for the helpful comments received from an anonymous referee and the editor on a previous version of the paper.

For people on the edge of the labour market, many of whom do not have access to other forms of transport, public transport is a very important source of accessibility to jobs. This analysis addresses what we see as a key research gap in Britain - whether there is a systematic variation in the level of employment at the local level with the quality of the public transport network. To address this we apply regression analysis to explain employment as a function of accessibility and other local labour and socioeconomic variables. Our data were based on a cross-section of output areas from the English part of the 2011 Census. We found a statistically significant relationship suggesting that, all else being equal, areas with shorter public transport times were associated with higher employment levels.","[Johnson, Daniel; Mackie, Peter] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Ercolani, Marco] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Leeds; University of Birmingham,"Johnson, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",d.h.johnson@its.leeds.ac.uk,"Ercolani, Marco/AAJ-8116-2020","Ercolani, Marco/0000-0002-0085-6664; Johnson, Daniel/0000-0002-1188-8610",Greener Journeys; UK Department for Transport,Greener Journeys; UK Department for Transport,We would like to acknowledge the funding and extensive guidance received from Greener Journeys (www.greenerjourneys.com) and the UK Department for Transport.

The multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) technique is employed to analyze the time series of Baltic Dry Bulk Freight Rate Index and the market trend of two bulk ship sizes, namely Capesize and Panamax for the period: from March 1st 1999 February to 26th 2015. In this paper, the degree of the multifractality with different fluctuation sizes is calculated. Special quantitative analysis by constructing two new time series considering finite-size effect of the objective time series is given to identify the possible source(s) of multifractality. Numerical results show that both Capasize and Panamax freight rate index time series are of multifractal nature. The origin of multifractality for the bulk freight rate market series is found mostly due to nonlinear correlation. The research contributes to risk management by providing various instructions for participants in shipping markets. Our main contribution is that our results better evaluate volatility behaviors in dry bulk carrier freight rate market, enabling them to adjust their strategies in time and avoid risk with a global vision through numerical results while applying quantitative analysis based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis.","[Chen, Feier] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tian, Kang; Ding, Xiaoxu; Miao, Yuqi; Lu, Chunxia] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Tingyi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Univ Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ Joint Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Ship & Deep Sea Exploration; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Lu, CX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",chenfeier@sjtu.edu.cn; tiankang@sjtu.edu.cn; dingxiaoxu63@126.com; Itymiranda1109@gmail.com; myqshe@163.com; chunxialu@sjtu.edu.cn,"Chen, Feier/J-6838-2019","Chen, Feier/0000-0002-3234-6896","MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [12YJCGJW001]; Students Innovation Program [201610248001, IPP12002, IPP14149, IPP14087]; Interdiscipline Foundation of Social Science and Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University [15JCMY11]; Center for Teaching and Learning Development of Shanghai Jiao Tong University [CTLD16B3002]",MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Students Innovation Program; Interdiscipline Foundation of Social Science and Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Center for Teaching and Learning Development of Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"We thank the reviewers for their valuable comments and insights and support from State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering.

Such challenges may occur through a specific legal case as in the U.S. (concrete judicial review) or through the petition of an opposition party at the constitutional court as in many parliamentary democracies (abstract judicial review). While the decision-making process of high court justices has been widely studied, the effect of anticipated judicial review on the composition of bills introduced in the legislature has received limited attention. This paper theoretically analyzes how the institutions of concrete and abstract judicial review influence the political rents associated with a bill when the justices decide solely based on the bill's ideological component. The results indicate that abstract review may lead in equilibrium to a greater diffusion of rents across the political spectrum through its anticipatory effect, while the rents under concrete review are more concentrated among the legislative winning coalition. When this is the case, abstract review improves the equilibrium payoff of the party that would be left out of the legislative winning coalition under concrete review and favors those parties that command large rents in the status-quo.

Such contracts typically involve monthly or annual premia which are related to the insured's risk profile. A given profile may change, based on observed outcomes which depend on the insured's prevention efforts. The aim of this paper is to analyze the latter relationship. In a two-period optimal insurance contract in which the insured's risk profile is partly governed by her effort on prevention we find that both the insured's risk aversion and prudence play a crucial role. If absolute prudence is greater than twice absolute risk aversion, moral hazard justifies setting a higher premium in the first period but also greater premium discrimination in the second period. This result provides insights on the trade-offs between long-term insurance and the incentives arising from risk classification, as well as between inter- and intragenerational insurance.","[Bourles, Renaud] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Cent Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Bourles, Renaud] EHESS, Marseille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Bourlès, R (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Cent Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France.;Bourlès, R (通讯作者)，EHESS, Marseille, France.",renaud.bourles@centrale-marseille.fr,"Bourlès, Renaud/AAJ-3766-2020","Bourlès, Renaud/0000-0001-9537-1258",,,,,30,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The integrated modelling framework allows to evaluate stakeholders' policy acceptability taking into account their heterogeneous preferences and their interactive behaviour. The stakeholder behavioural analysis proposed, together with technical and economic analyses, contributes to the ex-ante policy assessment needed to support policy-makers in taking well thought-out decisions. An application of the modelling framework is here presented with the aim to prove its feasibility and added value for UFT policy-making, since it provides a ranking of policies that are likely to be accepted by stakeholders and that satisfy their heterogeneous desires and objectives while accounting for interaction effects.

This optimal performance standard implements efficient cooperative investment more often under a policy that, in addition, allows buyers to collect compensation for nondelivery of the good (upon rightful rejection) than a policy that limits buyers' compensation to the recovery of the price. Although contracts with liquidated damages (i.e. a customized compensation function) can solve the investment problem as long as court enforcement is not too imperfect (in which case optimal liquidated damages are excessive and likely not enforced), the doctrine of material breach with an option to reject performs well as a default rule.

Investing in infrastructure is often presented as a solution to a number of problems such as unemployment, depopulation of rural areas and low economic activity. A number of studies have tried to estimate the effects on production from investing in infrastructure. The aim of this study is therefore to provide a systematic analysis of previous studies of this relationship. For that purpose, a meta-analysis of 776 estimates of elasticity of production with respect to infrastructure, was performed. The estimated effect (elasticity of production) of investing in infrastructure varies from -0.06 to 0.52. The effects appear to vary depending on the type of infrastructure in with the investment is made as well as between industries. It is also found that the estimated effects exhibiting high precision, are clustered around zero. This is to say that the higher the reliability of the estimate, the closer it is to zero.

The results show that plaintiff SMEs tend to reduce patent applications after patent litigation. Although there are several possible interpretations for this finding, we argue that it is most likely due to the negative effects of the high cost of patent litigation on the R&D activities of the plaintiff SMEs during the period of patent litigation. Moreover, we also find that the strength of patent rights applied for by the plaintiff SMEs after patent litigation increases. We argue that this is because the plaintiff SMEs realize the importance of the quality of patent rights and learn how to apply for stronger patent rights after experiencing patent litigation as plaintiffs. However, this learning effect only lasts until the fourth year after litigation and then disappears or starts to reverse beginning with the fifth year after litigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The majority of detainees are held because they cannot post bail. We estimate the impact of being detained pretrial on the likelihood of being convicted and sentence length using data on nearly a million criminal cases in New York City. Causal effects are identified using variation across arraignment judges in their propensities to detain defendants. We find that being detained increases the probability of conviction by 13 percentage points for felony defendants. Although pretrial detention lowers the probability of rearrest while cases are being adjudicated, this reduction in criminal activity is mostly offset by an increase in recidivism within 2 years after disposition. Higher pretrial detention rates among minority defendants explain 40 percent of the black-white gap in rates of being sentenced to prison and 28 percent of the Hispanic-white gap.

A less explored question in this context is how these institutions interact with turns in the economic cycle and the impact of different types of legal procedures on credit market performance. This paper fills these gaps by analyzing how differences in the availability of credit and the evolution of non-performing loans ratios may be partially explained by regional variations in the quality of loan contract enforcement during recent periods of sustained growth (2001-2007) and recession (since 2008) in the Spanish economy. This research concludes that a rise in the clearance rate of executions (i.e., when a judge enforces the repayment of a debt) increases the ratio of total credit to GDP. However, the declaratory stage of the procedure (i.e., when a debt is firstly verified by a judge) does not seem to be statistically significant. A possible explanation to this finding is that, throughout the economic cycle, a relevant proportion of the defaults that take place are strategic (i.e., defaults by a solvent debtor). Furthermore, it is observed that, in regions where declaratory procedures are more efficient, less credit is declared as non-performing. The latter effect, however, is only observed after the onset of the Great Recession in 2008. This may be related to the increase of non-strategic defaults during a downturn.","[Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S.; Martinez-Matute, Marta; Garcia-Posada, Miguel] Banco Espana Eurosyst, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Mora-Sanguinetti, JS (通讯作者)，Banco Espana Eurosyst, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",juans.mora@bde.es,"Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./AAK-2001-2021; Martínez-Matute, Marta/AAB-1383-2019","Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./0000-0003-0964-784X; Martínez-Matute, Marta/0000-0003-3855-7296",,,,,45,15,15,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

We modeled the impacts of changing climatic variables on forest growth, optimal harvest age, and land expectation value (LEV) for 11 representative slash pine sites in the Southeastern U.S. under two alternative climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). Our coupled modeling approach incorporated the 3-PG biological process model, a generalized carbon sequestration economic model, and Pressler's indicator rate formula to determine relative changes in prices, timber and carbon production. We generally found weak impacts of CC on slash pine LEVs and optimal harvest ages, but our results were sensitive to site productivity and location. CC increased LEVs in sites with low productivity for both RCPs. While a 1 degrees C increase led to the greatest LEV increase in Northeastern sites with low and moderate forest productivity conditions, Southeastern sites showed the greatest decreases in LEV. Higher (lower) future land values would shorten (lengthen) the current harvest age for slash pine. Changes in the rate of carbon and stumpage prices had the greatest impact on the rate of marginal economic revenues of slash pine.

One major shortcoming of the VAR that has limited its applicability is its heavy parameterization: the parameter space grows quadratically with the number of series included, quickly exhausting the available degrees of freedom. Consequently, using VARs for forecasting is intractable for low-frequency, high -dimensional macroeconomic data. However, empirical evidence suggests that VARs that incorporate more component series tend to result in more accurate forecasts. Most conventional methods that allow for the estimation of large VARs either require ad hoc subjective specifications or are computationally infeasible. Moreover, as global economies become more intricately intertwined, there has been a substantial interest in incorporating the impact of stochastic, unmodeled exogenous variables. Vector autoregression with exogenous variables (VARX) extends the VAR to allow for the inclusion of unmodeled variables, but faces similar dimensionality challenges. This paper introduces the VARX-L framework, a structured family of VARX models, and provides a methodology that allows for both efficient estimation and accurate forecasting in high -dimensional analysis. VARX-L adapts several prominent scalar regression regularization techniques to a vector time series context, which greatly reduces the parameter space of VAR and VARX models. We also highlight a compelling extension that allows for shrinking toward reference models, such as a vector random walk. We demonstrate the efficacy of VARX-L in both low-and high -dimensional macroeconomic forecasting applications and simulated data examples. Our methodology is easy to reproduce in a publicly available Rpackage. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we build a unique data set of several representative bus routes and show that the effects of the liberalization have been encouraging in terms of fares, new entry, higher frequency, and higher quality. First, with regard to international routes that used to be under cabotage, we find that relaxing quantitative restrictions has led to the expected results on the Lyon-Torino and Paris-London routes. Second, with regard to domestic routes newly created from the Loi Macron, mostly all procompetitive expected variations in the variables have been observed, except for fares. Indeed, we show that bus operators used an initial aggressive pricing strategy to induce demand for the new services and then increased fares once customers became accustomed with the service.","[Blayac, Thierry] Univ Montpellier, Fac Econ, UMR LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Bougette, Patrice] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Bougette, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",thierry.blayac@umontpellier.fr; patrice.bougette@unice.fr,,"Bougette, Patrice/0000-0003-3108-9522",,,,,25,23,23,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Since contractual commitments to lock in capital were not fully enforceable in partnerships, this evolution required a legal innovation, essentially granting the corporation a property right over capital. Locked-in capital exposed investors to a significant loss of control, and could only emerge where and when political institutions limited the risk of expropriation. The Dutch East India Company (VOC, chartered in 1602) benefited from the restrained executive power of the Dutch Republic and was the first business corporation with permanent capital. The English East India Company (EIC, chartered in 1600) kept the traditional cycle of liquidation and refinancing until, in 1657, the English Civil War put the crown under strong parliamentary control. We show how the time advantage in the organizational form had a profound effect on the ability of the two companies to make long-term investments and consequently on their relative performance, ensuring a Dutch head start in Asian trade that persisted for two centuries. We also show how other features of the corporate form emerged progressively once the capital became permanent.","[Dari-Mattiacci, Giuseppe; Jonker, Joost; Perotti, Enrico C.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gelderblom, Oscar; Jonker, Joost] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Perotti, Enrico C.] CEPR, London, England",University of Amsterdam; Utrecht University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Dari-Mattiacci, G (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"perotti, enrico c/A-6638-2010","Gelderblom, Oscar/0000-0003-3083-8747",Netherland Organization for Scientific Research (NWO VIDI) [016.075.332]; Becker-Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago,Netherland Organization for Scientific Research (NWO VIDI); Becker-Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago,"Giuseppe Dari-Mattiacci gratefully acknowledges the financial support by the Netherland Organization for Scientific Research (NWO VIDI grant 016.075.332) and the Becker-Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago (BFI Fellowship winter 2012).

After a symmetric relationship between woody biomass energy consumption and economic growth was determined by the nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) model, ARDL and Granger Causality methods were applied. According to results of the Granger Causality method, there is a unidirectional causality running from economic growth to woody biomass energy consumption for Botswana, Cameroon, Uganda, and Zambia and from woody biomass energy consumption to economic growth for Burkina Faso, Malawi, Central African Republic, Namibia, Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Gabon and Zimbabwe. The bidirectional causality was supported for Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar and Togo. Lastly, forecast error variance decomposition method was applied to support the results obtained from Granger Causality method. The forecast error variance decomposition results of real per Capita GDP and woody biomass energy consumption showed that woody biomass energy and real per Capita GDP made the important contribution to the forecast error variance of itself and each other.

Based on longitudinal and integrated quantitative and qualitative tracking of migrant household practices, financial diaries facilitate explorations of the social and contextual dimensions of remittances that may help account for their heterogeneous character. In particular, the paper highlights the partiality of diaries as well as the translocal interdependency and irregularity of household practices, providing clues for integrating remittances instead of isolating them as neutral instrumental transfers. It uses the example of household debt to further anchor remittances locally, illustrating how financial diaries can expose the changes and considerations that are part of household practices, including remittances. The paper concludes by suggesting that financial diaries need a decisively qualitative framework and may be particularly useful in contexts characterised by multiple migrations.","[Winters, Nanneke] Univ Antwerp, IOB, Prinsstr 13, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Winters, N (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, IOB, Prinsstr 13, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",nanneke.winters@uantwerpen.be,"Winters, Nanneke/J-6071-2015","Winters, Nanneke/0000-0002-8036-3690",Flemish Interuniversity Council VLIR-UOS; IOB Research Fund,Flemish Interuniversity Council VLIR-UOS; IOB Research Fund,"This research has benefited from a wide range of individuals and institutions, for which I am grateful.

The discourse is developed through studying the two significant cases in Pacific Asia and Middle East, where development is occurring on a spectacular scale: respectively Singapore and Dubai. In this study, Singapore is considered as an extreme case of transhipment hub ports, which has been successful in attracting logistics activity and developing a leading global logistics centre. By conducting a comparative case study approach and descriptive statistics, Dubai's competitiveness as a logistics hub is compared to Singapore, based on the following indicators: location; port container and air cargo handling respectively for the periods 1975-2015 and 2001-2015; basic socio-economic indictors (Population, GDP, GDP per capita and share of main sectors in the economy for the period 1990s-2015); infrastructures and transport facilities; ease of doing business; and more importantly the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) for the period 2007-2016. The aim is to fill the gap in the literature on emerging logistics hubs in the Middle East by confronting Dubai to Singapore, which is among the top global logistics centres. The study argues that Dubai is far from Singapore in terms of logistics performance. Nonetheless, the trade-infrastructural investments and rising freight distribution (via sea and air), yet also the growth in LPI in the past decade is a proof to Dubai's ambitious in evolving from a regional trading hub into a global logistics centre.","[Akhavan, Mina] Politecn Milan, DAStU, Pzza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Akhavan, M (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, DAStU, Pzza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",mina.akhavan@polimi.it,"Akhavan, Mina/ABE-4854-2020","Akhavan, Mina/0000-0001-7965-3618",,,,,63,6,6,8,82,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

J,"Anand, A; Dathan, M",,,,"Anand, Anita; Dathan, Michele",,,An empirical analysis of advance notice provisions in corporate bylaws: Evidence from Canada,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GOVERNANCE,"In recent years, firms have implemented advance notice provisions (ANPs) in their bylaws. ANPs require shareholders to comply with certain procedures and disclosure requirements if they intend to nominate directors at a shareholders' meeting. With a focus on ANPs, this is the first study that examines bylaw changes from an empirical standpoint. Specifically, we hand collected a comprehensive list of proposed and implemented bylaw amendments between 2004 and 2015 for 1,156 Canadian corporations listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We hypothesize that firms more vulnerable to a takeover bid or proxy contest are more likely to propose an ANP. In univariate and multivariate analysis, we find support for this hypothesis along several measures of vulnerability, including exposure or peer exposure to a proxy contest or takeover bid and various measures of shareholder dispersion. We also find evidence to support an alternative hypothesis that firms propose an ANP in lock -step with others in their industry. We also examine the potential rationales for proposing an ANP using an event study. We conclude that ANPs are implemented by vulnerable firms, potentially seeking to impede a change of control, as well as by firms following industry peers making corporate governance changes.

The FCGE model integrates the real economy with the financial one within a unified economic system, and traces the flows of financial and real resources among economic agents. The model is designed to analyze the economic effects of fiscal policies such as the transportation investment expenditures and alternative procurement approaches on economic growth and distribution among socio-economic classes, linking the investment expenditures with specific financial resources. It is possible to estimate growth anct distributional effects of each project based on the financing method over the construction and the operation and maintenance periods once the information on the investment expenditures, the construction location and the changes in the accessibility generated by the project are injected into the FCGE model. The simulations on the Indonesian transportation projects reveal that the government financing with tax revenues could generate higher effects on GDP than other financing methods.

Two questions are examined: 1) Is transport and logistics specialization a primary feature of large urban metropolitan regions or do rural nonmetropolitan regions (be they micropolitan or noncore) have the capacity to support this type of cluster? 2) Does transport infrastructure explain jobs in the transportation and logistics cluster? The research employs a county level lattice data of transportation and logistics cluster jobs from 2008 to 2012 as well as transport infrastructure variables. The findings reveal that the transportation and logistics clusters are concentrated primarily in metropolitan areas, and to some degree, in nonmetropolitan regions of the U.S. In addition, the transport infrastructure is found to have a positive impact on jobs in the transportation and logistics clusters over the period of the study. Intermodals have the largest effect on jobs, followed by airports, annual average daily traffic on the National Highway Planning Network, railroads, and ports. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Three main steps are involved: data decomposition via SR, individual forecasting via FNN and ensemble forecasting via a simple addition method. In particular, to capture various coexisting hidden factors, the effective decomposition tool of SR with its unique virtues of flexibility and generalization is introduced to formulate an overcomplete dictionary covering diverse bases, e.g. exponential basis for main trend, Fourier basis for cyclical (and seasonal) features and wavelet basis for transient actions, different from other techniques with a single basis. Using crude oil price (a typical complex time series) as sample data, the empirical study statistically confirms the superiority of the SR-based FNN method over some other popular forecasting models and similar ensemble models (with other decomposition tools).

The analysis is motivated by observing the interplay between the economic and demographic transition that has occurred in the developed world over the past 150 years. To the extent that high growth rates in the past have partly been the consequence of singular changes during the economic and demographic transition, growth is likely to become more moderate once the transition is completed. At the same time, a similar transition is on its way in most developing countries, with profound consequences for the development prospects in these countries, but also for global comparative development. The evidence presented here suggests that long-run demographic dynamics have potentially important implications for the prospects of human and physical capital accumulation, the evolution of productivity, and the question of secular stagnation.","[Cervellati, Matteo] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Cervellati, Matteo; Sunde, Uwe] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Sunde, Uwe] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Sunde, Uwe; Zimmermann, Klaus F.] CEPR, London, England; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Bologna; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Munich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University; Maastricht University,"Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",klaus.f.zimmermann@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,20,22,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Since tax revenue is one of the important sources of government revenue, a tax policy assumes significance as a vehicle for a viable and long-term source of revenue and economic growth. Similarly, economic growth has augmenting effects on the tax revenue of a country. This study investigates tax responsiveness to the changes in gross domestic product in Ethiopia in the period 1981-2014. It mainly focuses on the components of agricultural tax revenue: agricultural income tax and land use fee. In addition, it also studies personal income tax and business profit income. Understanding and analyzing the level of sensitivity of tax revenue to discretionary policy measures and GDP are essential in formulating fiscal policy. The empirical evidence on Ethiopia suggests that the trends in agricultural income tax and land use fee collection are highly inconsistent. Agricultural income tax and land use fee are not buoyant, indicating that the growth of the agricultural sector has no statistically significant impact on agricultural income tax buoyancy. However, personal income tax revenue, business profit revenue, and total direct tax revenue are responsive to changes in non-agricultural GDP in Ethiopia. In light of these findings, some policy interventions for improving tax revenue are suggested.","[Azime, Hassen] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Inst Tax & Customs Adm, Dept Publ Finance, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ramakrishna, Gollagari; Asfaw, Melesse] Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Sch Grad Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",,"Azime, H (通讯作者)，Ethiopian Civil Serv Univ, Inst Tax & Customs Adm, Dept Publ Finance, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",azimeadem@gmail.com; profgrk@gmail.com; drmelesse@gmail.com,"Gollagari, Ramakrishna/AAL-2820-2020; Gollagari, Ramakrishna/HCI-4909-2022",,,,,,32,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,291,309,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_13,0.0,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900013,0

There is thus strong empirical and theoretical interest to analyze the cross-section Engel function of real populations. A prerequisite of any economic interpretation is a reasonable estimation of these curves from given cross-section data containing households' expenditures and income. In submitted paper the Engel curves computation was applied on the Slovak household's income and expenditure. A double-log specification of the Engel's function has been chosen in order to estimate the expenditure elasticity of households by using an economic status of households' head at work for each household by children per person. The household Budget Survey of the Slovak Statistical office was used for the period 2004-2014. Analysis of income elasticity demonstrated negative correlation of food expenditure in Slovak households and the number of children in all food groups of the consumer basket classified as necessary goods. Examination of the households based on the economic activity of their head (employee, self-employed, retired, and others) showed differences in availability of various food groups for the households (inferior, necessary, luxury goods).

Consequently, the paper presents some relevant achievements in comparison theory and illustrates the connected concepts of similarity and classification. Finally, the paper recognizes that even though scientific comparisons are methodologically feasible, at the operational level they are not yet available, this exhorts the appraisers' community to a deep and thoughtful reflection and further researches.","[Berni, Marta] Univ Florence, Dept Architecture DIDA, Via S Niccolo 93, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Berni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Architecture DIDA, Via S Niccolo 93, Florence, Italy.",marta.berni@unifi.it,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,171,189,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_13,0.0,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600013,0

In the optimal contractual arrangement, the bride's cost moderates the threshold value of the conspicuous spending that she requires for marriage. We also find that a sound observable financial background ('old money') benefits both the suitor and the woman, and reduces wasteful spending on status goods.

Companies strive to deliver high service quality in order to meet growing customer requirements and to succeed on today's competitive market. Although the Saxon recreation centre for children and youth KiEZ Querxenland is situated very close to the CzechGerman border, it has difficulty acquiring Czech customers (primarily organized children and youth groups). Therefore, two types of research were carried out in order to define its competitive advantage that would appeal to Czech customers: firstly, a comparative price analysis with selected similar Czech recreation centres, secondly, qualitative research that used the focus group technique. Although KiEZ Querxenland possesses various quality certifications and is equipped above-average, the difference between the Czech and German price level is significant. Nevertheless, cross-border stays of Czech groups might be realized thanks to subsidies or grants. This was proved in a Czech-German cross-border project carried out by KiEZ Querxenland and is considered to be an example of best practice.","[Cervova, Lenka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46001, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Cervová, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Voronezska 13, Liberec 46001, Czech Republic.",lenka.cervova@tul.cz,,,Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec,Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec,"This article was written as part of a project to support research teams of excellence at the Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec, which is financed by institutional support for long-term conceptual development at the Faculty of Economics of the Technical University of Liberec.",,19,0,0,1,3,VERLAG GUC-GESELLSCHAFT UNTERNEHMENSRECHNUNG CONTROLLING M B H,LOBNITZ,"STEINWEG 32, LOBNITZ, D-08294, GERMANY",,,978-3-86367-051-1,GUC FACHB,,,2017,33.0,,,,,,23,30,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426794300002,0

The EN 9100 Standards (AS 9100 in America and SIAC 9100 in Asia), are a quality management system for the aerospace industry derived from the ISO 9001 standard, that include the requirements derived from the ISO 9001 and 83 specific additional requirements for the aerospace industry. This research aims to begin covering the virtual lack of studies about the results arising from the implementation of quality assurance standards in this sector. In particular, the objective of the research involves analyzing whether the appearance of the various positive effects that may arise as a result of implementing EN 9100 Standards is influenced by the following factors: a) size of the company; b) implementation of EN 9100 seniority; c) prevailing type of motivation (external and/or internal) to adhere to such standards. To that end, the research was addressed to the Spanish aerospace sector, and the population subject to the investigation was defined by 317 companies. A questionnaire was sent by postal mail and e-mail to the directors of quality of all the selected companies, and a multiple linear regression model was applied to data from the 126 valid survey responses. The results show that EN 9100 adherence seniority, as well as the prevailing type of motivation (internal or external), are significant variables for the appearance of positive effects arising from the implementation of EN 9100, while the size of the company is non-significant for the emergence of such positive effects.","[del Castillo-Peces, Carlos; Mercado-Idoeta, Carmelo; Prado-Roman, Camilo] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Social & Legal Sci Fac, Business Econ Dept, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"del Castillo-Peces, C (通讯作者)，Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Social & Legal Sci Fac, Business Econ Dept, Madrid, Spain.",carlos.delcastillo@urjc.es; carmelo.mercado@urjc.es; camilo.prado.roman@urjc.es,"Roman, Camilo Prado/A-3511-2016; Mercado-Idoeta, Carmelo/B-2840-2017","Roman, Camilo Prado/0000-0002-1540-0643; Mercado-Idoeta, Carmelo/0000-0002-1679-893X; del Castillo-Peces, Carlos/0000-0002-7912-5687",,,,,49,1,2,1,19,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Motor insurance with its two components - the Motor Third Party Liability Insurance (MTPL) and the Motor Damage insurance - constitutes the largest line of business of the non-life insurance sector in Europe. The present study models the voluntary motor damage insurance consumer behaviour using discrete choice models, hypothesizing a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical decision. The sample consists of 311 car owners from Cluj County, Romania. The econometric estimations use binary logit, multinomial logit and nested logit models. The predictive power of these models is compared by means of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for discrete choice models. The results reveal that the main factors affecting the purchase of a voluntary motor insurance policy are risk preference/aversion, the distance travelled by car, the driver's education level and the ratio between the driver's income and the car price. In contrast to previous studies who estimated the risk profile only through proxy variables without accounting for any behavioural aspects, our study has successfully integrated the risk profile of the policyholders as a self-standing explanatory variable. Since the explanatory variables are representative not only for a particular geographical area, the highlighted behaviour may be applied to all cases where motor damage insurance is voluntary.","[Dragos, Cristian Mihai] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Stat Forecasting & Math, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Dragos, Simona Laura] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Dragos, CM (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Stat Forecasting & Math, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristian.dragos@econ.ubbcluj.ro; simona.dragos@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Dragos, Cristian/IAO-9689-2023; Dragos, Simona Laura/B-4689-2016","Dragos, Simona Laura/0000-0002-3037-3401","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0745]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0745: Study of Romanian Life Insurances in International Context: Innovation, Spatial and Behavioral Modelling; Impact of Institutional Factors.",,29,2,2,6,17,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In this paper, we take a first step towards answering these questions by leveraging the rich debate on the EU to identify several institutional dimensions of democratic legitimacy and operationalizing them for comparative analysis. We then investigate the most important regional economic organizations (REOs) in the world. Our findings are three-fold: (i) there is systematic variation across REOs, with a group doing rather well, one mixed, and one poorly; (ii) procedural dimensions fare better than those related to representation or local self-determination; (iii) no organization exhibits or lacks legitimacy in all dimensions. These results qualify the perception that democratic legitimacy deficits are indiscriminately pervasive and indicate that the EU belongs to the most democratically legitimate group.","[Duina, Francesco] Bates Coll, Dept Sociol, 4 Andrews Rd, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA; [Lenz, Tobias] Univ Goettingen, Inst Polit Sci, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Duina, F (通讯作者)，Bates Coll, Dept Sociol, 4 Andrews Rd, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.",fduina@bates.edu; tobias.lenz@sowi.uni-goettingen.de,"Duina, Francesco/O-4082-2019","Duina, Francesco/0000-0002-5871-1222; Lenz, Tobias/0000-0002-6031-5261","European Research Council [249543]; Daimler-and-Benz Foundation postdoctoral scholarship; Max Weber fellowship at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy; European Research Council (ERC) [249543] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Daimler-and-Benz Foundation postdoctoral scholarship; Max Weber fellowship at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","The work on this paper was supported by the European Research Council [Grant 249543 'Causes and Consequences of Multilevel Governance'], a Daimler-and-Benz Foundation postdoctoral scholarship and a Max Weber fellowship at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy.",,89,7,7,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

However, many researchers have shown that this assumption is violated in practice. Such violations include the statistical properties of heavy tails, volatility clustering, leptokurtosis and long memory. This paper considers the pricing of contingent claims when the underlying is assumed to display long memory, an issue that has heretofore not received much attention. Aim: We address several theoretical and practical issues in option pricing and implied volatility calibration in a fractional Black-Scholes market. We introduce a novel eight-parameter fractional Black-Scholes-inspired (FBSI) model for the implied volatility surface, and consider in depth the issue of calibration. One of the main benefits of such a model is that it allows one to decompose implied volatility into an independent long-memory component-captured by an implied Hurst exponent-and a conditional implied volatility component. Such a decomposition has useful applications in the areas of derivatives trading, risk management, delta hedging and dynamic asset allocation. Setting: The proposed FBSI volatility model is calibrated to South African equity index options data as well as South African Rand/American Dollar currency options data. However, given the focus on the theoretical development of the model, the results in this paper are applicable across all financial markets. Methods: The FBSI model essentially combines a deterministic function form of the 1-year implied volatility skew with a separate deterministic function for the implied Hurst exponent, thus allowing one to model both observed implied volatility surfaces as well as decompose them into independent volatility and long-memory components respectively. Calibration of the model makes use of a quasi-explicit weighted least-squares optimisation routine. Results: It is shown that a fractional Black-Scholes model always admits a non-constant implied volatility term structure when the Hurst exponent is not 0.5, and that 1-year implied volatility is independent of the Hurst exponent and equivalent to fractional volatility. Furthermore, we show that the FBSI model fits the equity index implied volatility data very well but that a more flexible Hurst exponent parameterisation is required to fit accurately the currency implied volatility data. Conclusion: The FBSI model is an arbitrage-free deterministic volatility model that can accurately model equity index implied volatility. It also provides one with an estimate of the implied Hurst exponent, which could be very useful in derivatives trading and delta hedging.","[Flint, Emlyn; Mare, Eben] Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Maré, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Math & Appl Math, Pretoria, South Africa.",eben.mare@up.ac.za,"Mare, Eben/D-9752-2018","Mare, Eben/0000-0001-5966-3296; Flint, Emlyn/0000-0003-0626-3525",,,,,43,2,3,0,13,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this new approach, the management of an organisation is no longer about managing the return from capital, but it is about recognising and making use of the organisational, structural resources and the knowledge of the staff. While IC marked the transition from the traditional approach in which financial capital was key to gaining wealth to an approach in which knowledge stood out as the main resource of an organisation, be it public, private or education-oriented, the interest in identification and reporting of IC has grown as several models were developed to help orient management decisions. Building on the early work of several scholars (Hermanson, 1964, Hekimian and Jones, 1967) who first tried to account for the worth of employees, several models have been proposed in time (Sveiby, 1997, Mouritsen 1998, Meer-Kooistra and Zijlstra, 2001), in the attempt to report on IC resources and turn IC management into a pillar of strategic management. As IC has become one of the concepts embraced even by higher education institutions from business along with strategic planning or total quality management (Leitner et al., 2016), the transfer of IC models to public institutions has posed several challenges in terms of performance, bureaucracy and the role of the public servant (Sousa et al., 2016). Against the multitude of IC reporting models, scholars agree that, for an institution that wishes to be connected to the demands of the society, IC management and IC reporting is a way to make a the activity of an organisation more transparent, visible and more efficient. The purpose of this article is to generalize the concept of intellectual capital and its role in the development of an organisation, private and public. The methods applied are the synthesis and analysis of academic research and publications.","[Frusinoiu, Paula; Dima, Cristina; Constantinescu, Mihai] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Frusinoiu, P (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",paula.frusinoiu@gmail.com; cristina.dima@man.ase.ro; miconsysnet@yahoo.com,"Dima, Cristina/AAD-6401-2019","Dima, Cristina/0000-0001-7972-6004",,,,,17,0,0,0,2,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,999,1004,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100104,0

For this purpose, the internal documents were studied and interviews with the quality manager and employees were conducted. The main shortcoming of the system is almost zero awareness about the suggestion system among the employees and management. Other shortcomings are the insufficient motivation of employees, low awareness about current events in the system of suggestions and the fact that it is taking too long to approve suggestion and to start its realization. There is also no education of employees in the area of suggestions. To remove the first deficiency a training, that emphasizes the benefits of a well-functioning system of suggestions, is suggested. After the training should follow workshop that would teach employees and their managers to cooperate and allow them to experience the process of innovation in practice. Optimalization of reward system should be done to increase the motivation of employees to create suggestions. Author of suggestion should get a proportionally higher reward, which derives from the benefits of implementing his suggestion. As an additional element to motivate employees a yearly competition in individual innovations is suggested. Lack of information within the suggestion system can be easily solved by creating boards that will contain the necessary informations. To faster the evaluation process it is proposed to involve the evaluation of suggestions into the job descriptions of the relevant heads of the departments and it is also proposed to exclude the financial manager from the process of approval and evaluation of the suggestions if the amount of reward will not exceed 10 000 CZK. To increase employees skills needed for creating suggestions further trainings in this area are strongly advised. These proposals will start the process of individual innovations within the company and therefore enhance its competitiveness.","[Fuka, Jindrich; Bednarova, Dagmar] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Fuka, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",fukaji00@jcu.cz; bednar@ef.jcu.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-499-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,268,278,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ7IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427306200029,0

Based on previous studies we expected that IN indexes are superior to Ohlson and Altman model. The excellency of our research lies in validation and assessing the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction models at three levels: the overall accuracy, accuracy of the bankruptcy prediction, and the non-bankruptcy prediction accuracy. This analytical structure enables to look at the topic more complexly and to increase the objectification of accuracy of analysed models. Based on the results, we showed that Ohlson model is not applicable to predict bankruptcy in the Slovak conditions as reached the lowest bankruptcy prediction ability even if has high non bankruptcy prediction ability. On the other hand, we have confirmed our expectation about the bankruptcy prediction ability of index IN05, that is proven to be superior to Ohlson and Altman model and so is the most appropriate model for Slovak business environment.","[Gavurova, Beata; Packova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Misankova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Smrcka, Lubos] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Technical University Kosice; University of Zilina; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; miroslava.packova@tuke.sk; maria.misankova@fpedas.uniza.sk; smrckal@vse.cz,"Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Packova, Miroslava/AAE-5555-2020; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015","Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Kovacova, Maria/0000-0003-2081-6835; Packova, Miroslava/0000-0001-7042-0981",Slovak Research and Development Agency: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies,This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under Grant number APVV-14-0841: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies.,,54,69,69,8,72,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Its main focus is on examining how functional income distribution can influence the evolution of productivity and thereby promote economic growth. We obtained key variables and their evolution from the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency dataset on medium and large scale manufacturing firms. The paper uses the evolutionary economic framework and the evolutionary theory jointly with its evolutionary econometric approach. This sees economic growth as an open-ended process. The major findings and conclusions of this paper are lack of strong evidence of evolution (intra-industry selection) to foster productivity growth and reallocation (structural change). The employment share of each firm within an industry entered the model with a negative sign but a significant coefficient. In economic terms, the positive and negative coefficients of labor share within a firm and employment share of each firm within the industry give us important information about structural changes within the manufacturing sector. The key policy lesson is that access to bank loans is of great importance to firms. This is particularly so for industries such as spinning, tanning and publishing in which all firms that had access to bank loans revealed movements in their employment shares. This is evidence of structural transformation. It is desired that future research includes economy-wide modeling, estimation and more formalization of evolutionary economic models to study the link between access to bank loans and its effects on income distribution and inclusive economic growth.","[Gebremeskel, Atnafu] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Gebremeskel, A (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",atnafuga@gmail.com,,,"Jonkoping International Business School, Jonkoping University (Sweden); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)","Jonkoping International Business School, Jonkoping University (Sweden); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)","This research is supported by the Jonkoping International Business School, Jonkoping University (Sweden), in collaboration with Addis Ababa University for doctoral studies in economics, a project supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).",,54,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,177,203,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_9,0.0,,,27,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900009,0

After we had established the existence of panel cointegration in the sample, we estimated cointegration equations using FMOLS and DOLS estimator. The results show that real effective exchange rate appreciation had an adverse effect on the current account, while the net inflow of direct foreign investments has a positive impact, as private remittances. The survey also confirmed that the current account deficit in the SEE countries is persistent. The results indicate that the structural changes in the SEE countries should be carried out in order to reduce the CA deficit.

The publicly traded firms listed in the KOSPI market are examined from 2000 to 2016. Our empirical analysis finds inactive capital structure adjustments for the listed Korean firms, consistent with the U.S. evidence. However, our duration analysis emphasizes the significant role of fixed adjustment cost in the determination of capital structure adjustments, in contrast to the existing studies emphasizing both of fixed and convex cost components. This paper verifies the existence of capital structure adjustment costs for the publicly traded Korean firms.

Yet these factors have often been poorly approximated in empirical research that has used generalized proxy measures to account for subtle personal differences. This article argues that the psychological literature on personality traits can help address this issue and provide important insights into the socioinstitutional determinants of innovation. It uses a unique, large-scale psychological survey to investigate the relationship between the Big Five personality traits commonly used in psychology-openness to experience, neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness -and patenting in travel-to-work areas in England and Wales. The main personality trait associated with innovation is conscientiousness, a trait defined by organization, hard work, and task completion. Instrumental variable analysis using religious observance in 1851 suggests that this is a causal relationship. Research on the role of intangibles in innovation has been preoccupied by factors, such as creativity and trust, but the results of this article suggest that a new focus-on hard work and organizational ability-is needed.","[Lee, Neil] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.d.lee@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,79,35,36,8,68,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

A better understanding of the relevance of local factors that determine the competitiveness of these economies in providing multinational firms with location advantages can guide policymakers in their attempt to attract foreign capital flows. This, however, has not been previously addressed by the empirical literature at a firm level and across sectors. Our results suggest that Spanish investments in developing and transition economies are mainly driven by market-seeking factors. They also confirm the relevance of the business and financial climate in the location decision of multinational firms. Finally, the estimations reveal differences between manufacturing and services foreign direct investments in several local factors, such as the agglomeration effects, skilled labour and financial risk.","[Marti, Josep; Alguacil, Maite; Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Ave Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Alguacil, Maite; Orts, Vicente] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Ave Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Ave Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.;Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Ave Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",arnauj@uji.es; alguacil@uji.es; orts@uji.es,"Alguacil, Maite/AAA-2338-2019; Orts, Vicente/K-5921-2014; Alguacil, Maite/K-9815-2014","Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170; Orts, Vicente/0000-0003-1708-9868; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FinMaP) [FP7-SSH-612955]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; FEDER [ECO2014-58975-P]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054]; University Jaume I [UJI-B2016-53],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FinMaP)(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); University Jaume I,"The authors thank the anonymous referees and editor for their helpful comments.

A brand's personality is known to increase consumers' preference for and usage of a brand, which may result in stronger emotional ties and loyalty towards that brand and, ultimately, a sustainable competitive advantage for that brand. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data from a sample of 1822 Generation Y students aged between 18 and 24 years, registered at two South African public higher education institutions. The questionnaire comprised 66 brand personality traits of symbolic products, anchored on a five-point Likert-type scale. Participants were requested to indicate the extent to which each of those traits reflected the Nokia brand. The captured data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and a t-test. The findings suggest that Generation Y students perceive the Nokia brand to be reliable, trustworthy and intelligent. The findings also suggest that African respondents have a notable higher brand personality perception of the Nokia brand than White respondents.","[Muller, Re-An; Bevan-Dye, Ayesha L.] North West Univ, Fac Econ Sci & IT, Vaal Triangle Campus, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; Vaal University of Technology (VUT),"Muller, RA (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Fac Econ Sci & IT, Vaal Triangle Campus, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.",Rean.Muller@nwu.ac.za; ayeshabevandye@gmail.com,"Muller, Re-an/AAM-4023-2020; Bevan-Dye, Ayesha L/D-7165-2012",,,,,,34,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,785,796,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_50,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000050,0

The objectives of the research were to identify the the influencing words for each metaprogram extracted from the previously mentioned instrument. In order to do that, the research was conducted in three stages: identifying the typologies of the sample population, identifying the preferred words from the Influencing Language, and testing the words by creating a set of messages for different companies, which will result in finding the magical words. Three semi-structured interviews were used for each stage. Throughout the research two contexts were taken into consideration, normal groceries shopping and Christmas shopping case, in order to prove whether or not the metaprograms are context related and how it influences the magical words. From the research results we can see that the majority of the sampled population were influenced by the preferred words to a certain extent, however only half of the messages created with those set of words had a real impact.","[Roman, Teodora; Manolica, Adriana; Ionita, Laura-Elena] Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Roman, T (通讯作者)，Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania.",throman@uaic.ro; manolica@uaic.ro; ionitalaura@gmail.com,"Roman, Cristina/JPY-2979-2023; Manolica, Adriana/AAK-4579-2021; Roman, Teodora/ACO-3152-2022","Roman, Teodora/0000-0003-4828-9723",,,,,9,0,0,2,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,943,955,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100097,0

I analyse some key elements of these movements, the new epistemologies that they employ and the ethopolitics that they espouse, and suggest that the key operative concepts may be the people', security and control.

Knowledge search is an issue of concern for Chinese firms because many firms generally have relatively weak research and development (R&D) and innovation capabilities that cannot support innovative development through mere internal innovations. This study examines the interactive effects of network centrality, structural holes, and knowledge tacitness when formal knowledge search depth (FKSD) affects innovation performance from the perspective of formal/informal knowledge search. A survey of 161 firms in China suggests that FKSD positively affects innovation performance, and the effect is positively moderated by network centrality. Given high knowledge tacitness, FKSD is more effective in fostering innovation performance when firms' network centrality is higher. Furthermore, high knowledge tacitness results in rich structural holes negatively moderating the effect of FKSD on innovation performance, whereas low tacitness generates a positive moderating role. This indicates that Chinese firms may consider using more formal search channels to increase external knowledge search depth and to dynamically adjust the depth of such a formal search or the mode of network structural embeddedness according to the degree of knowledge tacitness.","[Ruan, Aijun] Taizhou Univ, PR China Sch Econ & Management, 1139 Shifu Rd, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jin] Tsinghua Univ, PR China Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Taizhou University; Tsinghua University,"Ruan, AJ (通讯作者)，Taizhou Univ, PR China Sch Econ & Management, 1139 Shifu Rd, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.",ruanaj@aliyun.com,,,"National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [CNSF 71172111, CNSF71232013, CNSF 71102154, 71272171]; Philosophy and Social Sciences Fund of Zhejiang Province [15JDJS02YB]",National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Philosophy and Social Sciences Fund of Zhejiang Province,"This article is the partial fulfilment of the projects sponsored by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (CNSF 71172111, CNSF71232013, CNSF 71102154 and 71272171) and the Philosophy and Social Sciences Fund of Zhejiang Province (15JDJS02YB).",,53,8,8,7,98,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

After conducting research in many different aspects, this paper finds out the main reasons why banker resources have not met the requirements of society, which can be summarized as follows: management methods of State agencies have only been implemented for form's sake and their development planning is not appropriate for economic environment; most of training facilities focus on scale rather than the quality; the way of doing business of some banks creates a lot of potential risk but they have no appropriate management mechanism; and students majoring in banking sector have negligent learning attitude and deviant thinking of their career in future.","[Truong, Van Khanh] Univ Finance Mkt, Finance & Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Tram, Bich Loc] Saigon Univ, Finance & Accounting Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Saigon University,"Truong, VK (通讯作者)，Univ Finance Mkt, Finance & Banking Fac, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",vankhanh.ufm@gmail.com; trambichloc@gmail.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,255,258,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000070,0

It is suggested to assess the market reaction on change in share price via using graphical approaches. Investors buy shares with the expectation that its price will rise in the future. But sometimes expectations don't coincide with reality and then shares are sold. This work has been taken into account in the asymmetry between expectations of investors and results. In order to identify the position of a company in 2D space, the paper uses classification algorithm of random forests with data on change in share price during the period of the year in the inputs, and the forecasts of analysts, i.e., whether a price will increase or decrease, for the same year in the outputs. Thus, two clusters of companies are seeking to represent: one of the companies whose changes in share price coincide with investors' expectations, and another one - on the contrary. This method can be useful to investors, for whom it is important to identify the market reaction about companies from the whole industry or its branches and analyze its trend.","[Vaiciulyte, Ingrida] Siauliai State Coll, Fac Business & Technol, Ausros Al 40, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Kalsyte, Zivile] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Studentu G 50, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sakalauskas, Leonidas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Fundamental Sci, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Plikynas, Darius] Vilnius Univ, Inst Math & Informat, Akad G 4, LT-08663 Vilnius, Lithuania",Siauliai State College; Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius University,"Vaiciulyte, I (通讯作者)，Siauliai State Coll, Fac Business & Technol, Ausros Al 40, LT-76241 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",i.vaiciulyte@svako.lt; kalsyte@yahoo.com; leonidas.sakalauskas@mii.vu.lt; dplikynas@gmail.com,,"Vaiciulyte, Ingrida/0009-0008-0895-9343",,,,,30,1,1,0,3,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

To assess the forecasting performance a recursive pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting experiment for six key euro area macroeconomic variables is conducted.

The sub-objective is to identify the seasonality related with the harvest of major producers. The data set is based on closing daily prices, liquidity (volume) and open interest at CME futures market for the period 2006 - 2015. The historical volatility index was used to determine volatility in the data. The seasonality pattern is obvious only for volume of individual contract months of corn futures. The analysis of daily closing prices found the more volatile second part of the calendar year, but this volatility decreases by the end of November and is the lowest in February. It was the year beginnings which were supposed to be more volatile, because the new harvest is traded via the December contracts. The liquidity is probably related with the business cycle. The observed volume reached its maximums during the years of world financial crisis (2008 - 2009). The seasonality pattern is obvious only for volume of individual contract months of corn futures. The volume is the highest for December contracts and then it gradually decreases for the rest of contracts. This findings corresponds with the assumption about the impact of harvests. Analysis of individual futures contract volatility didn't prove this assumption.

However, according to the Czech Statistical Office, Czechs prefer pastry to bread. While the average person consumed more than 80 kg of bread a year after World War II, its consumption was only half (39.72 kg) in 2016. On the other hand, consumption of wheat pastry increased from 16 kg in 1949 more than three times to 48.3 kg. It is, therefore, undisputed that the consumption of bread is constantly decreasing. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the development of bread consumption in the past few decades and to identify the possible causes of this development. The analysis uses data from the Czech Statistical Office, from the Association of Bakers, and information obtained by qualitative research. Statistical analysis of the data was complemented by a pilot survey of consumer behaviour on the bread market. The results of the survey include the identification of basic breakpoints in the development of bread consumption and the analysis of their causes Quantitative analysis was compared with qualitative research focusing on changes in production technology, production management, and changes in consumer behaviour. The conclusions of the paper include the identification of basic breakpoints in the development of bread consumption and the analysis of their causes. Important factors influencing the consumption of bread are changes in eating habits, a significant increase in the range of wheat pastry products, the entry of whole grain products on the market etc. The price analysis of both bakery products (bread and wheat pastry) showed that the price had a negligible impact on consumption. E.g. since 1995, the price of bread has grown by about 75%, while for the price of ordinary pastry by 115%. Still, the sales of pastry were steadily rising, while the sales of bread fell.","[Strachotova, Dana; Kutnohorska, Olga; Sudzina, Frantisek] UCT Prague, Dept Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Strachotová, D (通讯作者)，UCT Prague, Dept Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",dana.strachotova@vscht.cz; olga.kutnohorska@vscht.cz; frantisek.sudzina@vscht.cz,,,,,,,16,1,1,2,21,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,359,366,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800050,0

It starts with the challenge of defining and measuring animal welfare. Subsequently, the demand for farm animal welfare is evaluated from both the citizens' perspective and the consumers' perspective. The much-cited preference gap in between these perspectives constitutes a dilemma for the governance of animal welfare. Literature on the supply of farm animal welfare discusses the implications of enhancing farm animal welfare for production cost. The linkages between farm structure, farm technology, and animal welfare are discussed, and the frequently voiced hypothesis that smaller and more traditional farms automatically imply higher farm animal welfare levels is rejected. We examine the central challenge to the governance of farm animal welfare: its effects on competitiveness and trade. We also discuss objectives, governance instruments, the interplay of different policy instruments, and how to combine them for an effective and efficient strategy for farm animal welfare.","[Grethe, Harald] Humboldt Univ, Int Agr Trade & Dev Grp, D-10009 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Grethe, H (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Int Agr Trade & Dev Grp, D-10009 Berlin, Germany.",grethe@hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,68,37,39,3,59,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4709-3,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Especially in the case of food, we meet on the part of consumers with an emphasis on place of production, composition and authenticity. This interest grows along with the attention and space in the traditional and modern media dedicated to food fraud and adulteration. The regional product represents an alternative for the consumer, which, in the case of certification of this product, provides a relative assurance of authenticity guaranteed by an independent authority. This paper deals with the regional product, which, as previous research has shown, consumers associate mostly with food, agricultural and natural products. The aim of the paper is to identify the most appropriate distribution places for regional products. The research findings are supported by both secondary and primary data which derived from research conducted through a questionnaire survey, whose 1,390 respondents are residents as well as visitors of eight different micro-regions in the Czech Republic. Half of the respondents who have ever purchased a certified regional product have done so on the farmers' markets. The second most frequent place of purchase was then specialized stores. Almost a third of respondents purchased a regional product directly from the producer either to his own store or directly to the place of production.","[Margarisova, Klara; Vokacova, Lucie; Kuralova, Katerina; Stanislavska, Lucie Kvasnickova] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Margarisová, K (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",margarisova@pef.czu.cz; vokacova@pef.czu.cz; kuralova@pef.czu.cz; kvasnickova@pef.czu.cz,"Kvasničková Stanislavská, Lucie/R-8301-2017; Kuralová, Kateřina/C-1197-2017; Vokáčová, Lucie/B-9767-2017; Margarisova, Klara/B-8090-2017","Kvasničková Stanislavská, Lucie/0000-0001-7360-8509; Kuralová, Kateřina/0000-0001-9104-7696;","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM, CULS Prague [20181004]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM, CULS Prague","This paper was supported by Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM, CULS Prague [nr. 20181004 -Innovative activities in the context of sustainable development: the potential of regional labeling].",,26,1,1,1,8,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,174,180,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800024,0

But what exactly is a social norm? Environmental economists studying the topic draw on diverse scholarly traditions and may not have the same phenomenon in mind when using the concept. For example, social norms may refer to common, but not necessarily socially approved, behaviors; to internalized ethical rules; or to one of several equilibria in a coordination game. I first discuss some of the definitions used in the environmental economics literature. Then, I outline a simple framework for analysis of voluntary contributions to public goods. Using this framework, I illustrate differences and similarities between altruism, moral norms, and social norms and discuss implications for environmental policies. In particular, when a social norm represents one of several stable equilibria, policy can potentially invoke abrupt and dramatic behavioral changes.","[Nyborg, Karine] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Nyborg, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway.",karine.nyborg@econ.uio.no,,"Nyborg, Karine/0000-0002-0359-548X",,,,,92,36,36,2,41,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The study was conducted on a sample of 125 farmers markets' products. Based on the analysis of 127 products from the farmers' markets in Prague, it can be said that the distance from the destination of their origin is from 1 km to 838 km. The most local products sold at the farmers' markets are vegetable and bakery products. Beyond that the least local products are wine, beer, meat and sausages. According to the regional labelling rules, regional food can be considered as such that is produced in the region and coming mainly from local resources. In the field of beer, wine, meat and sausage, the distance these products was identified as the greatest and therefore there is a high possibility of increasing the competitive advantage based on the production of food that will meet this requirement.","[Balcarova, Tereza; Pilar, Ladislav; Polakova, Jana] CULS Prague, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Petkov, Rosen] Tech Univ, Sofia, Bulgaria",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Technical University Sofia,"Balcarová, T (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",balcarova@pef.czu.cz; pilarl@pef.czu.cz; polakovaj@pef.czu.cz; rosen@scas.acad.bg,"Balcarova, Tereza/N-4869-2017",,"IGA PEF CZU (CULS) - Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda [20171033, 00001959]",IGA PEF CZU (CULS) - Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda,"This research article was supported by IGA PEF CZU (CULS) 20171033 - Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda, Nr. 00001959.",,46,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,7,13,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800001,0

I then focus on the role of CRBFM in addressing environmental and social impacts external to the group of fishers, such as bycatch, habitat impacts, and spatial conflicts. The review suggests that CRBFM can effectively address both intrafishery and external impacts, provided there is sufficient incentive to do so, including maintaining access to preferred markets or the threat of further regulation. However, CRBFM can create moral hazard and adverse selection problems, and successful CRBFM institutions generally have homogeneous membership with well-aligned interests and/or formal contracts with monitoring and enforcement provisions.","[Holland, Daniel S.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Holland, DS (通讯作者)，NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",dan.holland@noaa.gov,,,,,,,87,19,19,0,9,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

This framework highlights the dual role of inputs as a source of environmental problems and part of the solution; it also addresses uncertainty and momentum effects.

This category of approaches exhibits a limited conceptual capacity of modelling the dynamics of production systems that are in a permanent interaction with the multitude of factors that influence the profit dynamics. Reducing the complexity of interactions to simple linear causality relations leads to an assessment with great approximation of production risk and farm resilience. Many studies made by international institutions as well as academic studies have proposed solutions for production risk assessment through yield adjustment policies, and by means of financial products like futures contracts and contracts with options acting in a coupled way with production diversification, crop insurance, production contracting, etc. as instruments limiting the production risk. The Dynamic Bayesian Networks are a generalization of hidden Markov models as the space of states is represented in a factored form instead of a single discrete random variable. In their turn, the Dynamic Bayesian Networks are a generalization of Kalman filters [Kevorchian and Hurduzeu, 2000] by the fact that the Gaussian distributions can be replaced by any probability distributions. By combining the causal analysis associated to Bayesian inference with the stochastic approach on agricultural production risk assessment, a unitary theoretical context is provided for the approach of risk assessment and mitigation by means of an index acting as a proxy for the forecast losses. Our approach is based on using the Selyaninov (SHR) index, as bi-dimensional indicator (rainfall / temperature). The weather risk coverage category can supply an on-line insurance scheme to be implemented with low transaction costs on the background of low risk appetite. The class of Markov models helps us in modelling the Selyaninov index dynamics, being an important instrument in the management of production risk dynamics.","[Kevorchian, Cristian; Gavrilescu, Camelia] Romanian Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Kevorchian, C (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",ck@fmi.unibuc.ro; cami_gavrilescu@yahoo.com,"Gavrilescu, Camelia Anisoara/HHC-0836-2022","Gavrilescu, Camelia Anisoara/0000-0003-1538-7642",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

Land degradation was identified as one of the major threats to the European agriculture. Ukraine is particularly vulnerable to the effects of land degradation with one of the highest rates of soil erosion in Europe. Land degradation, due to irrational land use, hinders development of agricultural sector and rural areas. This paper estimates the losses from land degradation on the value of agricultural production in Ukraine. The strategy for development of rural areas and adaptation of agricultural enterprises of Ukraine to global warming proposes to put a number of strategic measures that would allow to prevent soil degradation processes on the one hand, and on the other - that would contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during cultivation and increase carbon sequestration, i.e. humus in the soil, thus ensuring rational land use. Strategic priorities of development of low-carbon agricultural land use are proposed. Practical implementation of these activities may contribute to the development of rural areas of Ukraine and adaptation of agriculture to climate change.","[Kucher, Anatoliy] Natl Sci Ctr, Inst Agrarian Econ, Inst Soil Sci & Agrochem, Chaikovska 4, UA-61024 Kharkov, Ukraine",National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine; National Scientific Center Institute for Soil Science & Agrochemistry Research named after O.N.

Both agrarian trade competitiveness and territorial and commodity structure changes are analyzed from the perspective of the last 20 years (1995-2015). Agrarian trade commodity structure is analyzed based on standard Harmonized System (HS 01 - HS 24). The basic source of data for the analysis is UN COMTRADE. The analyses are done through the application of the following methods: Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage, respectively Lafay Index, Trade balance index and also the Product mapping approach. Except for above mentioned methods also some other statistical characteristics are applied: basic index, chain index, geomean, import/export coverage ratio etc. The export of agricultural products of Uzbekistan is quite competitive especially in relation to the Asian countries and CIS countries, the comparative advantages in relation to other territories are limited.

Of course, the hypothesis raises many questions. What exactly is the dichotomy of secondary towns versus big cities? What is the evidence for the contribution of secondary towns versus cities to poverty reduction? What are the economic mechanisms for such a differential contribution, and how does policy interact with them? We find preliminary evidence and arguments in support of our hypothesis, but the impacts of policy on poverty are quite complex, even in simple settings.

Development of sustainable competitive advantage refers to a logical understanding of advantages and flaws of a firm in regard to possibilities and threats on the market. Research on behaviour of buyers and appropriate targeting of the real segment provides input values for development of a special marketing mix. The essential connection of the consumers' needs with the firm's possibilities constitutes brand development. This process enables a firm to develop a special distinctive identity and to position itself on the market so as to differ from its competitors. The traditional economic theory is based on the assumptions of perfect competitive markets, on which numerous salesmen offer identical products for sale. It is assumed that all the products are perfectly replaceable; thus, by competition process, the prices become minimal up to the sufficient level to pay suppliers, in order for them to be able to continue operation on the market. The research shows that the products differ with the level to which they can be differentiated. Most of the agricultural products are homogenous because of their basic market and commercial-technological features. In other words, agriculture, as an economic activity, is as specific as the most of raw agricultural products, and also some food products (raw meat), can be classified in the group of homogenous products, with small or no opportunities for differentiation. The exception is surely production of healthy, organic food, where there are significant opportunities for brand development and products differentiation. Generally, the agricultural products have insignificant opportunities for differentiation, but such products are the best to check the talent for marketing.","[Mihailovic, Branko; Vukovic, Predrag] Inst Agr Econ, Volgina 15 St, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Mihailovic, B (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ, Volgina 15 St, Belgrade, Serbia.",brankomih@neobee.net; predrag_v@iep.bg.ac.rs,,,"Republic of Serbia strategic goals' realization within the Danube region - Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development [III - 46006]","Republic of Serbia strategic goals' realization within the Danube region - Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development","The paper represents a part of the research at the project III - 46006 - Sustainable agriculture and rural development in terms of the Republic of Serbia strategic goals' realization within the Danube region, funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development.",,13,0,0,0,2,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

The industrial revolution contributed to excess consumption by stimulating demand and lowering the cost of alcohol. It also led to concentration in some alcohol industries, especially brewing. In recent years, the emergence of craft producers has countered firm concentration and the homogenization of alcoholic beverages. Meanwhile, governments have intervened extensively in alcohol markets to reduce excessive consumption, raise taxes, protect domestic industries, and/or ensure competition.

In the first part the long-term development tendencies of the typical primary farm production natural indicators and of the selected foodstuffs consumption in the CR have been discovered, described and modeled. The exponential smoothing methods have been applied in the forecasts for non-seasonal time series with local linear trend (the Holt method) and the double exponential smoothing method (the Brown method).

Even despite the convenient natural and climate conditions of Czech rural landscape it has failed so far to increase volume or at least mitigate the decline of domestic production in economically demanding and traditional commodities. Socio-economic factors have been projected into the food consumption development, changes in purchase demand and life priorities and attitudes in particular.

The empirical literature generally finds a positive link from good environmental performance to financial success. However, many studies reveal a negative link. Given this mixed evidence, literature reviews and meta-analyses help to discern the conditions under which better environmental performance prompts financial success or disappointment. Similarly, this review organizes the empirical evidence by the specific measures of environmental performance and financial performance to discern which links are positive or negative. Lastly, the review identifies shortcomings in the empirical literature and offers suggestions for future research. For example, analyses should more fully explore the factors shaping the links from environmental to financial performance, such as firm size and economy type (e.g., mature market).","[Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Earnhart, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",earnhart@ku.edu,,,,,,,86,8,8,7,76,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Food security, income, savings, and work participation are thus inseparable components of the wellbeing of India's rural population, and key variables in understanding the impact elderly farmers have on household income, spending and savings, and consequently, food security. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire administered within Lakhisarai district, resulting in 388 household samples, and 203 elderly household member samples. Recorded household income, spending and savings, and the number and average age of elderly household members were used in the regression analyses, while the self-reported difficulty levels were used to calculate the work intensity indices by age, gender, and agricultural activity. They were supplemented with descriptive statistics, including the most common activities performed by rural elderly, and the most and least difficult activities. Regression output highlighted the statistically significant relationship between the number and average age of elderly household members, and the household income and spending, but not the savings. In other words, having an additional elderly household member contributed slightly more to household income than spending, although the predictive power of regression models was fairly low. Similarly, there was a statistically significant link between the age of elderly household members and the self-reported difficulty of performed agricultural activities, with difficulty being negatively correlated with the increase in age. Lastly, produce selling was reported as the least difficult activity, while transporting grains was rated the most difficult.","[Milovanovic, Vladimir; Smutka, Lubos] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Milovanovic, V (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",milovanovic@pef.czu.cz; smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20171018]","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","The project was realized with the support of the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (20171018 -Aging in rural India: Implications for agriculture and smallholder farmers).",,26,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,181,188,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800025,0

Since 2001, rural areas have been showing a higher population growth than cities in the Czech Republic. This change is reflected not only in the agricultural sector, but also in the structural characteristics of the present countryside. The number of small municipalities with up to 200 inhabitants has been decreasing for a long period. However, this is not only caused by their decline, but also by an increase in their population figures to more than 200 inhabitants. Traditionally shown indicators, such as specific features of rural families, cohesion of rural communities, lower educational level, fewer job opportunities, lower purchasing power or rural interconnection with the agricultural sector, could recently be evaluated within the context of current megatrends.

Nowadays, the internet is used by more and more people and for many companies represents an important distribution channel, to target on groups of customers. Currently the internet is increasingly used in food sale as a distribution channel. The subject of the paper is to evaluate consumer preferences when purchasing food online. This paper, follow up customers experiences, preferences and last but not least willingness try to use e-grocery among customers of all ages in various regions of the Czech Republic. Data acquired in the framework of quantitative research and questionnaire survey has been selected as a methodological tool for this paper. Respondents were persons from different age groups and from various regions of the Czech Republic. The questionnaire concerning online shopping of food preferences has been answered by 669 respondents, 44 % of men and 56 % women. For the evaluation of the questionnaire survey statistical methods were used to examine the dependence between the variables (Fischer, Pearson test). Research shows that over 24 % of the respondents have experience buying food online and over 5 % buy food online on regular basis. Furthermore, it has not been proven that the frequency of food shopping affects the place of purchase. There has been evidence of dependence between age and experience of purchasing food online, where younger persons have more experiences. The research was realized through questionnaires survey at the turn of 2017 and 2018. The contribution of this paper is to present current preferences of customers in innovative approaches in food buying as a guide for food vendors.","[Eichler, Michal; Salkova, Daniela; Hes, Ales] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Broz, David] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Eichler, M (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",eichlerm@pef.czu.cz; salkova@pef.czu.cz; brozd@pef.czu.cz; hes@pef.czu.cz,"Hes, Aleš/H-3788-2018; Šálková, Daniela/H-4401-2018",,Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague [20171014],Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague,"This article was supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague, No. 20171014 - Optimizing the distribution of food intended for special nutrition with a focus on gluten-free products.",,16,0,0,3,14,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,36,43,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800005,0

The price projections are modelled for three years ahead. Two different types of regressions for both current and constant (fixed) prices are available - polynomic and linear. The CEN model was originally developed for the price predictions in the sector framework of the Czech Economic Accounts for Agriculture. From this, the price predictions can be utilized not only in the private sector by individual farmers, but also by policy-makers to prepare or assess policy measures for the price risk management.

Every year, Europeans throw into the containers 89 million tons of unused food every year. A large share of this has a current trend in food purchases over the last decade.

This review considers several demand-side issues associated with the economic analysis of these attributes. First, despite ample research and media discussion suggesting strong preference for these food attributes, market shares remain low. Hypothetical bias and social desirability bias likely play a prominent role in explaining this disconnect. There has also been an increase in government and food industry regulation aimed at socially acceptable credence attributes, and this article considers why public votes and policy positions appear discordant with retail shopping behavior. One set of policy proposals involves more information disclosure related to such attributes; however, the welfare economics associated with information provision is not straightforward. While much has been learned about consumers' stated willingness-to-pay for socially acceptable credence attributes, this review suggests that more research is needed to understand the current environment surrounding these food characteristics.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jlusk@purdue.edu,,,,,,,118,15,17,2,11,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

On the one hand, it is a loan granted by the supplier to the recipient with the sale of goods and services (receivables from the supplier), on the other hand, it is a short-term source of financing of current supplies (liabilities to the supplier). This form of financing of agricultural activity with limited access to external sources of financing ensures the continuity of production processes. The purpose of the study is to indicate the credit position of farms in Poland. The goal is realized in two stages. In the first stage, on the basis of the review of the current research results, the role and significance of trade credit in business activity was determined. In the second stage, the credit position of farms in Poland was determined. Research results should help determine whether mutual lending can effectively provide and increase agricultural production. The analysis was carried out on the basis of accounting data obtained in 2010-2015 by agricultural holdings that keep accounting under the Polish FADN. To determine the credit position of agricultural holdings, the credit position indicator was used, which is the relation of trade receivables to trade payables. The obtained research results indicate that among farms in Poland a much larger percentage are farms that credit their recipients than they themselves use deferred payment terms for delivered goods or services. The credit position of farmers is significantly different due to the type of production, economic size and area of agricultural land. Taking into account the average production volume, it should be noted that farmers from farms who take the position of recipient of commercial credit reach a much higher value of production than farmers who have credited their recipients.","[Zawadzka, Danuta; Kurdys-Kujawska, Agnieszka] Koszalin Univ Technol, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Koszalin, Poland",Koszalin University of Technology,"Zawadzka, D (通讯作者)，Koszalin Univ Technol, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Koszalin, Poland.",danuta.zawadzka@tu.koszalin.pl; agnieszka.kurdys-kujawska@tu.koszalin.pl,"Kurdyś-Kujawska, Agnieszka/D-1835-2019","Kurdyś-Kujawska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6024-2947",,,,,15,2,2,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,452,458,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800063,0

As a food of animal origin, edible insects may contain undesirable pathogenic microorganisms. This study was therefore focused on the identification and enumeration of microorganisms in adult house crickets (Acheta domestica), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) superworms (Zophobas mono) in their raw states, after killing with boiling water, and after drying at 105 degrees C. Determination of the total bacteria count, the presence of bacteria of the genus Bacillus, and the presence of yeast was carried out by cultivation on Petri dishes. Detailed identification of bacteria was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The results of the enumeration of microorganisms indicated significantly higher values in raw and boiled samples than in the dried samples. In total, ten different bacterial species were detected by MALDI-TOF MS. The occurrence of the species was dependent on the sample processing. In conclusion, the microbiological safety of edible insects should be monitored in the same way as in conventional foods. Insects can contain various microorganisms even after processing. Tested samples contained multiple bacterial strains that are known to cause nosocomial infections and possess antibiotic resistance. Our findings indicate that immunosuppressed individuals in particular could be at risk when consuming edible insects.","[Kourimska, Lenka; Svejstil, Roman; Popelarova, Eva; Modrackova, Nikol; Homolkova, Dana] CULS Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Microbiol Nutr & Dietet, Prague, Czech Republic; [Adamkova, Anna] CULS Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Qual Agr Prod, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kulma, Martin] CULS Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Zool & Fisheries, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kourimska, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Microbiol Nutr & Dietet, Prague, Czech Republic.",kourimska@af.czu.cz; svejstil@af.czu.cz; popelarova@af.czu.cz; adamkovaa@af.czu.cz; kulma@af.czu.cz; modrackova@af.czu.cz; homolkovad@af.czu.cz,"Modrackova, Nikol/D-7242-2018; Kouřimská, Lenka/ABH-9315-2020; Švejstil, Roman/V-9131-2018","Modrackova, Nikol/0000-0002-4390-1277; Kouřimská, Lenka/0000-0002-1102-7239;",Internal Grant Agency of The Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CIGA) [20182009],Internal Grant Agency of The Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CIGA),"We are thankful to our student Zaneta Ferusova, who collaborated on laboratory analyses.

The main objective of this paper is to provide a tentative assessment of the EU food self-sufficiency after Turkey's accession under the customs union conditions. The research was based on data of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The self-sufficiency ratio (SSR) for Turkey and the EU both before and after Turkey's accession was measured as the ratio of food produced to food consumed at the domestic level, using the following equation with respect to food production and trade: SSR = Production x 100 / (Production + Imports - Exports). The following items were considered: cereals, fruits, oil crops, sugar and sweeteners, sugar crops, vegetable oils, vegetables, meat, animal fats, eggs and milk The research results showed that potential Turkey's accession to the EU does not considerably change the EU self-sufficiency ratios. It is possible that EU self-sufficiency will decrease in some cereals, oil crops, animal fats and milk, whereas it is estimated to increase for fruits, vegetables, sugar and sweeteners, meat (excluding beef) and eggs. Self-sufficiency in the case of fruits may improve the most, although the EU will probably still be unable to satisfy its food needs. However, the abovementioned results imply that Turkey's membership in the EU does not conflict with one of the initial objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was to promote increased rates of self-sufficiency for the EU.","[Pawlak, Karolina; Jabkowski, Dawid] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pawlak, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland.",pawlak@up.poznan.pl; dawid.jabkowski@up.poznan.pl,"Pawlak, Karolina/ABE-9279-2020","Pawlak, Karolina/0000-0002-5441-6381",,,,,22,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,222,228,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800031,0

Apart from the primary sources they also used secondary sources which encompassed both domestic as well as foreign literature. As results from the conducted investigations, the issue of farm animal welfare is important for the consumers (71%) or very important (29%). A vast majority of them think, that animal welfare should be better protected in Poland than it has been done so far. These attitudes are determined by the respondent gender, age, education and place of dwelling. Protecting animal welfare is a significant problem for a majority of women, persons with tertiary education and city dwellers. Regarding food consumer attitudes towards farm animal welfare, three types of attitudes were identified: active consumer, consumer cautiously adjusting to new trends on the food market and consumer who does not follow new trends.","[Szafranska, Monika] Univ Agr, Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow,"Szafranska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Agr, Krakow, Poland.",m.szafranska@ur.krakow.pl,,"Szafranska, Monika/0000-0002-4948-7636",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,374,380,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800052,0

Many decisions in the agriculture have the outcomes which are realized through the longer period, after the decision is made. The sources of risk and uncertainty in agriculture are varied, but it can be summarized in five areas of management: production and technology, prices and market, finance, legislation and employees. Risk management in agriculture is engaged in reducing the possibilities of unfavourable outcomes or alleviating its negative effects. Not every decision will be right every time, but decision-making under uncertainty is difficult. The decision can be improved by identification of possible events, assessment of values of its outcomes and variability.

The promise of these technologies is more food, produced on less land, with fewer inputs and a smaller environmental footprint. At present, however, barriers to realizing this potential include a lack of ability to aggregate and interpret data in such a way that it results in useful decision support tools for farmers and the need to train farmers in how to use new tools.

The share of individuals employed in agriculture in the total labour force employed in the national economy in Poland was over 2.5-fold higher than the EU-27 mean. The high employment rate in Polish agriculture is reflected in the offered low wages and as a consequence - the income per capita in farmers' households being lower than outside agriculture. Excessive labour resources in agriculture discourage farmers from any attempts to modernise the production system, since investments or the use of specialist service providers are rarely economically competitive in relation to the use of cheap labour resources (employed for low wages). In the analysed years the share of individuals employed in agriculture in the total labour force employed in the national economy was systematically decreasing. This was made possible thanks to the absorption of labour resources released from agriculture by non-agricultural sectors, the occupational deactivation of older farmers and economic migration abroad. Without a further reduction in employment in agriculture it is impossible to limit the income disparity between the farming population and the individuals earning their living outside agriculture. Additionally, attainment of economic and social goals of sustainable agriculture will also be hindered since land use and capital utilisation may not be optimised.","[Kolodziejczak, Wlodzimierz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Finance & Accounting, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kolodziejczak, W (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Finance & Accounting, Poznan, Poland.",kolodziejczak@up.poznan.pl,"Kołodziejczak, Włodzimierz/ABE-9463-2020","Kołodziejczak, Włodzimierz/0000-0001-7315-6717",National Science Centre within the MINIATURA research project [NCN DEC-2017/01/X/HS4/00565],National Science Centre within the MINIATURA research project,"The paper is funded by the National Science Centre within the MINIATURA research project No. NCN DEC-2017/01/X/HS4/00565, entitled Determinants of Economic Activity of the Rural Population in Poland.

Increasing data saturation demands more efficient processing, but also provides possibilities with regards to higher interactivity of GIS applications. These current trends push GIS towards more dynamic solutions that can be more readily deployed. This is also evidenced by the increasing abandonment of classic software models and shift towards utilization of cloud-based solutions.

Our focus turns to review the recent history of public policy tackling risk management of the farming sector. In this exercise, we focus on both the EU and the national perspective, with special emphasis on implementation experience. We discuss in details the current two-pillar risk management system that was introduced in Hungary in 2012 in which the first pillar refers to an all-risk crop damage mitigation fund, while the second pillar is a voluntary, market-based insurance with state support scheme. In this regard we present recent figures of all important aspects of the system including participation and financial performance using the annual assessment reports. Finally, we present the continuing progress of the national risk management system discussing the challenges of the implementation of the IST programmed in the RDP and possible ways to go forward with the risk management system based on the most recent developments in the field.","[Kemeny, Gabor; Molnar, Andras; Zubor-Nemes, Anna; Illes, Ivett; Juhasz, Aniko] Res Inst Agr Econ AKI, Budapest, Hungary",,"Kemény, G (通讯作者)，Res Inst Agr Econ AKI, Budapest, Hungary.",kemeny.gabor@aki.gov.hu; molnar.andras@aki.gov.hu; nemes.anna@aki.gov.hu; juhasz.aniko@aki.gov.hu,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,2,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

We address the extent to which traditional wisdom and standard conceptual and empirical models that have girded thought about market power in the food chain for decades apply in modern food-market contexts and examine recent work on competition in the food chain to gauge the most promising paths forward. A key conclusion is that considerations that go beyond the bounds of standard models likely cause market power to be less than would be predicted based on the highly concentrated structures of many modern agricultural and food markets. These considerations include downstream buyers who rationally internalize long-run implications of their pricing decisions to farmers, powerful food manufacturers and retailers who countervail each other's market power, and the complex pricing decisions of multistore and multiproduct food retailers.","[Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Xia, Tian] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Kansas State University,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,163,59,64,1,40,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The goal of the paper is to study the price mechanism in the dairy chain and transmission of milk price from the farm to the final products delivered by dairies.

At present, the Russian agricultural insurance market is in imperfect condition. It is not regulated by market laws of supply and demand, but rather is strictly administrated by the government. The number of agricultural companies having an insurance contract decreased five-fold in the past 6 years because of decreasing government insurance support, oligopoly in the insurance market, and unprofitable terms of insurance for farmers.

It is concluded that household consumption patterns, structure and failure of nutrition, are determined by the composition and socio-demographic structure of the family, the availability of children, their age, income level and the state of health of family members, as well as the influence of different socio-cultural factors (education level of family members, their system of values and cultural attitudes).","[Morekhanova, Marina; Vyalshina, Anna] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agrarian Problems, Moscow, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Agrarian Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Morekhanova, M (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agrarian Problems, Moscow, Russia.",mayurm118@gmail.com; anvyal@mail.ru,"Vyalshina, Anna/V-5999-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,189,195,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800026,0

The purpose of social farming is to provide social services when using agricultural resources. Thus, it is a concept where social issues are solved via agricultural activity. In the Czech Republic it is still a slowly developing concept, to which, however, considerable potential is contributed. Because the primary goal of a social farm is not to generate profit but a public benefit activity, the key factor for ensuring of their development and operation are subsidies. All social farms in the Czech Republic draw subsidies support for different activities, namely in social, agricultural, environmental, educational or cultural area. Also difference between institutions granting subsidies derives from it. From the point of view of granted subsidies the turning point was the programming period 2007 to 2013 when the biggest support ever was paid to social farms. Nevertheless, the subsidies support which has been paid in recent years has proved to be decreasing, even though the highest number of social farms ever was registered in the Czech Republic in 2017. Thus, it seems that social farms are beginning to be capable of self-funding. Although there are subsidy titles for social farms also in the programming period 2014-2020, until now the demand for subsidies has proved to be not as high as in the previous period. In comparison in particular with western countries in the European Union the number of social farms in the Czech Republic is at lower level. These countries are well aware of importance of services ensured by social farms. Thus, it is necessary to create further stimuli which would support social farms in the Czech Republic.","[Prochazka, Jan] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cejpova, Irena] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Psychol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Smekalova, Tereza] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Procházka, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",prochazka3@pef.czu.cz; cejpova@pef.czu.cz; smekalovat@pef.czu.cz,"Cejpová, Irena/H-2949-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,252,261,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800035,0

We show that existing constraints on take-up can partially be overcome using revised contract designs, advanced technology for better measurement, improved marketing, and better policy support.

Agriculture in Slovakia has also currently different structure compared to agriculture in old EU member states. The majority of UAA (75%) is cultivated by large farms - agricultural holdings - with 1200 ha per farm on average. Therefore, although subsidies in form of direct payments per hectare are lower than in old EU member states, the payment per farm is one of the biggest in EU. In the paper, we analyse the effect of large farms on rural employment, wages, agricultural production and profitability of large farms. The analysis is based on individual farm data in the period 1994 to 2014 in Slovakia.

The sugar industry in Poland has a long tradition and is of great economic, social and environmental importance as well as an essential part of the food security policy. The sugar industry is a strategic food economy branch as sugar is the main sweetener. The social importance of the sector results from the fact that the sugar beet production is a source of income for growers while the sugar industry and service companies generate national income and jobs. The sugar beet cultivation is a part of sustainable agriculture. The abolition of production quotas will result in significant changes in the sugar industry. The scenarios for the evolution of the situation in the sugar industry should take into account two basic elements: changes in the EU market following the regulatory reform as well as changes in the economic situation in the global market and foreign trade conditions.

In this guide for practitioners, we discuss several features of this regression discontinuity in time framework that differ from the more standard cross-sectional RD framework. First, many applications (particularly in environmental economics) lack cross-sectional variation and are estimated using observations far from the temporal threshold. This common empirical practice is hard to square with the assumptions of a cross-sectional RD, which is conceptualized for an estimation bandwidth shrinking even as the sample size increases. Second, estimates may be biased if the time-series properties of the data are ignored (for instance, in the presence of an autoregressive process), or more generally if short-run and long-run effects differ. Finally, tests for sorting or bunching near the threshold are often irrelevant, making the framework closer to an event study than a regression discontinuity design. Based on these features and motivated by hypothetical examples using air quality data, we offer suggestions for the empirical researcher wishing to use the RD in time framework.","[Hausman, Catherine] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rapson, David S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hausman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",chausman@umich.edu; dsrapson@ucdavis.edu,,"Rapson, David/0000-0001-8711-7030",,,,,31,163,196,14,131,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The structure of the consumption has not changed much, but beef meat (BM) consumption decreased. Consumers started to prefer poultry meat (DM) due to health reasons and high increase of BM price. Knowledge about future consumer' prices is desirable to ensure that meat is available also to low-income households. The aim of the paper is to model consumer prices of BM, PM and DM and predict them from 03/2018 to 02/2019. Methodological objective is to find suitable method for modelling of consumers price of meat: Box-Jenkins methodology (ARIMA) or VAR model. Monthly data were taken from Czech Statistical Office for 01/2006-02/2018. First, the time series were explored in terms of their stationarity and seasonality. Time series were non-stationary and only PM price was seasonal, but insignificantly. The consumer prices depended mainly only on the lag of price one month ago: BM - ARIMA(1,1,0)c, PM - ARIMA(1,1,0) with unit impulse in 06/2008, DM - ARIMA(1,1,0) with unit impulse in 07/2008. However, the projections of price were unsatisfying. VAR(2) model showed weak relations between consumers' prices.

This may cause certain problem to low-income households that might not be able to afford enough meat for balanced nutrition.

Due to the nature of the food supply chains, especially temporal imbalance of supply and demand, quality requirements and exchange of quality information, an important issue might be an increase in the level of integration within the chains. It is to be noticed that integration of supply chain is one of the factor for using or limiting the functional weaknesses of the market, which are related to the three sustainability aspects as environmental, social and economic resources, as assumes the concept of sustainability.

From the application of social cost-benefit analysis to investments in developing countries in the 1970s to the use of increasingly sophisticated general equilibrium models today, the menu of available techniques for policy assessment has expanded rapidly. In addition, both partial and general equilibrium models have been developed to analyze world markets for agricultural commodities and the effects of government policies on such markets. Alongside the modeling of markets and the quantitative impact of policies, several indicators have been developed that build on trade policy measures, including effective protection and tariff equivalents. One example is the producer subsidy equivalent. This has been used by theOECD to estimate the level of support provided by government policies to the agricultural sector. The indicators have more recently been applied to developing countries as a form of benchmarking to give a snapshot of the transfers among stakeholders inherent in such policies.","[Josling, Tim] Stanford Univ, Food Res Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Josling, Tim] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Josling, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Food Res Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Josling, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",josling@stanford.edu,,,,,,,56,0,0,3,9,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

However, most SP researchers are still reluctant to pose WTA questions to respondents due to concerns about reliability of responses and confusion about what contexts warrant a WTA question compared to a willingness-to-pay question. This review synthesizes the current literature, provides guidance on when and how to use WTA elicitation formats, and identifies research needs. We present a typology of valuation tasks that illustrates the situations in which WTA questions are appropriate and should be used to estimate welfare-theoretic measures of economic benefits-and when they should be avoided. We also discuss three different design issues that SP researchers need to consider when they use WTA questions: (a) elicitation of reference and status quo conditions, (b) incentive compatibility and private versus public goods, and (c) nonconforming responses. We conclude that good survey design makes it possible to ask respondents sensible WTA questions in many cases, yet several key research issues require attention.","[Whittington, Dale] Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27559 USA; [Whittington, Dale] Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27559 USA; [Whittington, Dale] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9SS, Lancs, England; [Adamowicz, Wiktor; Lloyd-Smith, Patrick] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P5, Canada",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Manchester; University of Alberta,"Whittington, D (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27559 USA.;Whittington, D (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept City & Reg Planning, Chapel Hill, NC 27559 USA.;Whittington, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9SS, Lancs, England.",dale_whittington@unc.edu,"Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/ABE-4463-2020","Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/0000-0002-0786-0877; Whittington, Dale/0000-0002-6075-8812; Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",,,,,39,24,25,2,36,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4709-3,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The aim of the paper is to assess the height of domestic production to preserve current consumption structure of beef, pork and poultry in the Czech Republic (CR) and not to overcome production possibilities in crisis if imports, exports or both are limited or impossible. The development is simulated by optimization model AGRO-2014 that links agriculture, food industry, trade and food consumption. Five scenarios were calculated. In case of a crisis where imports are eliminated, and exports kept at the current level (scenario 1), the level of domestic resources would be exceeded. The need for areas for growing not only feed crops exceeds the land in the CR by 66%. Therefore, scenario 2 - crisis when import and export are impossible - was considered. Even in this case, the Czech area would not be sufficient. In scenario 3, imports are limited to 20% of current levels and the country does not export. Then the land area would be sufficient. It would require less sucker cows, but significantly more pigs and poultry. Scenario 4 (where imports are possible from 50% while export is on 50% level) needs slightly more cattle but pork could be partly imported. The increase in land claims would exceed available by 20%. Optimal use of land would occur in scenario 5 with imports on 50% level and exports reduced to 18%. It is problematic to increase the export of agricultural commodities while reducing imports. In the case of pork, it would be necessary to increase the number of pigs to cover domestic consumption and exports to the extent that it would be impossible to provide enough grain feed due to lack of available land.","[Foltyn, Ivan; Simpachova Pechrova, Marie; Zednickova, Ida] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Foltyn, I (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic.",foltyn.ivan@uzei.cz; Simpachova.Marie@uzei.cz; zednickova.ida@uzei.cz,,,Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information [1110/2018],Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information,The research was financed from Internal Research Grant of the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information No. 1110/2018.,,11,0,0,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,44,50,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800006,0

Another benefit lies in measures estimation to minimize the risks to a safe level. The HACCP methodology can be used at any steps of a food production sequence, from food preparation processes to packaging and final distribution. There are seven HACCP principles, which are described in the international standard ISO 22000 FSMS (2011). The paper objective is to design the critical control points monitoring requirements (the fourth HACCP principle) for the meat-processing industry. Data is obtained in the processing of sausage in MP Krasno Company, Limited. The methodology is based on the two regression models designs to describe the progress of transmitted pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and fungus) that can result in the disease or death of the person. The second model describes the rate of sterilization after the control measurement. These two variables are put into balance, and then we have determined constant of a random vector cover the entire incidence of pathogens by using the integral calculus of more variables. We have equilibrated these two variables and then determined a constant by using the integral multiplicity of functions covering the entire random vector of the pathogens. The constant is covering the random vector of the pathogens and can be used to determine control area monitoring in the fourth HACCP principle. We have formulated two research questions to verify the practical benefits. First, we focused on the use of a factorial design to reduce the occurrence of pathogens, and then we investigated the use of the random vector M region to downsize the production variability.

The paper aims to provide an overview of different approaches to the understanding of food self-sufficiency and to present the relationships between agricultural productivity, trade and self-sufficiency in the agriculture of the EU countries, including Poland, and the US. The research was based on data of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT). The research results showed that Poland was self-sufficient in all basic agricultural products, while the self-sufficiency ratios increased in 2004-2013. In 2004-2013, the EU and the US improved their self-sufficiency in products of animal origin, whereas domestic production of commodities of plant origin was stable or even increasingly lower compared to available supply. The study confirmed that foreign trade either improves or does not disrupt self-sufficiency of the countries considered. Favourable production ratios and relatively high productivity levels of available land, labour and capital usually support adequate levels of agricultural production and promote achievement or improvement of food self-sufficiency.","[Pawlak, Karolina] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pawlak, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland.",pawlak@up.poznan.pl,"Pawlak, Karolina/ABE-9279-2020","Pawlak, Karolina/0000-0002-5441-6381",National Science Centre within the OPUS research project [2015/17/B/HS4/00262],National Science Centre within the OPUS research project,"The paper is funded by National Science Centre within the OPUS research project No. 2015/17/B/HS4/00262, titled,Polish agri-food sector under the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP).",,16,2,2,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,215,221,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800030,0

The aim of the paper is to describe the current situation at the global market with butter and to explain the main reasons of rapidly increasing prices during the last periods. Within the analysis the main attention is paid to the Czech market. However, the tendencies and the main factors are common for the all countries all around the world, just with some regional specifics that are also depicted. The examination of butter market and possibility of its modelling and forecasting arisen from the current situation in the dairy agri-food chain all around the world. The general overview as well as consecutive analysis is based on the determination of the main factors influencing the butter market. The possibility of forecasting of the consumer price of the butter is strongly affected by rapid increase of the price during the 2nd half of the year 2017. The question is whether any suitable model can be estimated and used for the prognostic purposes of the price of butter. The structure and the development of the consumer price of butter in the Czech Republic were modelled using the time series analysis. Concretely, SARIMA (1,1,0) (1,0,1)(12) model with 2 instrumental variables representing the specifics of the butter market in analyzed period was selected as the most suitable for the description of analyzed time series as well as for the prognostic purposes. Based on this model, the consumer price of butter was forecasted for the period January 2018 - April 2018. The analysis has shown that the consumer price of the butter should decrease in the following periods; however, its level seems to be still higher compared to the level before its increase in year 2017.","[Rumankova, Lenka] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Rumánková, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",rumankova@pef.czu.cz,"Rumánková, Lenka/H-4357-2018",,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,304,310,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800042,0

The study used the diagnostic survey method with an original questionnaire, by means of which 1128 respondents from three regions of eastern Poland were eventually examined. The methodological procedures allowed to calculate the sample, where the confidence interval was set at 0.95, the fraction size was 0.50, and the maximum error was 0.05. The Student t test, ANOVA statistics and the Pearson correlation test were used in statistical analysis. The analyses have shown that inhabitants of eastern regions emphasize the importance of regional products - 44.48% of respondents buy local products several times a month. According to respondents, it is best to promote regional events, such as fairs and markets using TV and radio advertising. Statistical analysis demonstrated that respondents' gender influenced the perception of various forms of advertising. It was shown that curiosity and uncommonness of local products is one of the main reasons for purchasing them at regional fairs.

The implementation of restrictions as 5% environmental tax per tons of fuel, between 1 and 5% environmental tax on the use of pesticides and between 1% and 5% of the profit to be invested for research and development would have a strong negative impact on agricultural holdings in economical aspect and highly positive impact on environment. Implementation of integrated production, whose main element is integrated pest management.

We review the literature on this topic from a global perspective. In terms of environmental and climate change effects, organic farming is less polluting than conventional farming when measured per unit of land but not when measured per unit of output. Organic farming, which currently accounts for only 1% of global agricultural land, is lower yielding on average. Due to higher knowledge requirements, observed yield gaps might further increase if a larger number of farmers would switch to organic practices. Widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats and also entail output price increases, making food less affordable for poor consumers in developing countries.

Maize seeds were found more tolerant as compared to weed species. Furthermore allelopathic plant water extracts applied in combination had more inhibitory effect than their sole application, however the efficacy of commercial herbicide was more pronounced in suppressing the germination and seedling growth of test species. Hence it is concluded from the current study that allelopathy could be a potential source for designing an alternative to synthetic herbicide. Results showed that S.bicolor, H.annuus and P.hysterophorus WE @ 33.33+33.33+33.33 (g/L) reduced the dry biomass of T.portulacastrum and L.regidum by 54-68 % and 35-41 %, whereas the commercial herbicide","[Rashid, Haroon Ur; Khan, Ayub; Khan, Sami Ullah; Saeed, Muhammad; Khan, Shah Masaud] Univ Haripur, Dept Agr, Kpk, Pakistan; [Hassan, Gul] Univ Agr Peshavar, Dept Weed Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan",,"Rashid, HU (通讯作者)，Univ Haripur, Dept Agr, Kpk, Pakistan.",haroonkhanaup@yahoo.com; peerayub@gmail.com; hassanpk_2000pk@yahoo.com; samiullah@uoh.edu.pk; msaeed@uoh.edu.pk; drshahmasaudkhan@uoh.edu.pk,"Masaud khan, Shah/JDD-2846-2023; Hassan, Gul/L-9648-2019",,Higher Education Commission (HEC) Pakistan,Higher Education Commission (HEC) Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"This study is a part of PhD dissertation that will be submitted to the University of Haripur Pakistan.

Although expectations are high, less is known about the economic importance of the bioeconomy. This article reviews the methodological challenges of measuring the bioeconomy, the approaches used, and the outcomes reported. The results show that measuring the bioeconomy is still in its infancy and faces a number of methodological challenges. Bioeconomy cuts across sectors and therefore cannot be treated as a traditional sector in economics. Economics must catch up with bioeconomy realities. For a comprehensive economic assessment, information about bioeconomy resources, compounds, and product flows is required.

The empirical data for the study was provided by a survey, which was performed in 2017 on a group of 283 respondents, out of which 143 were customers of traditional grocery shops, and the remaining 140 were customers of organic food fairs. The authors deliberately chose different types of consumers because they tried to compare different product preferences among them. The study revealed that when buying food products, the majority of consumers carefully examined attached labels with nutritional information. What is more, they were willing to buy products obtained from primary wheat forms. Certain differences were observed in feedback provided by members of both groups. Customers who regularly bought organic products were more concerned with the quality of the cereals and they were more willing to buy products with increased nutritional value. Thus, it can be argued that promoting primary wheat types through scientific and introductory studies, as well as the production of high-quality cereal products is beneficial.","[Szczepanek, Malgorzata] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Dept Agron, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Prus, Piotr] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Dept Agron, Lab Econ & Counseling Agribusiness, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Knapowski, Tomasz] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Dept Biogeochem & Soil Sci, Lab Agr Chem, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology,"Szczepanek, M (通讯作者)，UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Dept Agron, Bydgoszcz, Poland.",piotr.prus@utp.edu.pl; malgorzata.szczepanek@utp.edu.pl; knap@utp.edu.pl,"Knapowski, Tomasz/AGS-8612-2022; Prus, Piotr/L-6034-2019; Szczepanek, Malgorzata/AAD-3638-2019","Prus, Piotr/0000-0002-4447-4019; Szczepanek, Malgorzata/0000-0003-1354-5627",,,,,36,4,4,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,381,387,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800053,0

Nowadays, all those working in scientific research raise the concern of how to clearly define their identity and put their name under their own publishing activities, quotations, research agriculture projects or patents. There are different solutions; however, these are often very heterogeneous tools with a number of different specifics and problems. Thus, it is not possible to establish a simple methodology for creating a unique signature or identity that could be used to clearly identify the author of a paper, scientific project or a patent. Problems often occur when a large number of authors have the same surname and same initial of their first name. In addition, authors of scientific publications with more than one first name (this occurrence is more common outside the countryside of the Czech Republic) often do not use all of their initials, which contributes to confusion over the allocation of publications to the author.

The research problem analysed within this study was connected with a tentative answer to the question whether and to what extent agricultural production of individual EU-28 countries guarantees food self-sufficiency at present and may do so in the future. The aim of this study was to investigate the diverse agricultural production levels in EU countries in view of the potential permanent food self-sufficiency. The study was conducted using the deduction and comparative methods based on FAOSTAT, EUROSTAT and BFCN data as well as literature on the subject. The largest food producers in UE-28 are the countries belonging to the EU-15 group: Germany, Italy and Spain, and in the case of some products also Great Britain. Among the EU-13 countries only Polish agriculture has reached the volume of agricultural production comparable to the level in those countries. As a whole the EU-28 group as well as its old part, i.e. EU-15, and the new part (EU-13) presently are and until 2080 will continue to be self-sufficient in terms of food production. The only exception in this respect is fruit, the demand for which within the forecasted period is and will still be covered by internal EU production in approx. 2/3 in the EU-15, at the forecasted surplus in 2080 in the EU-13 countries. The degree of self-sufficiency varies in individual EU countries. Thus it is necessary to ensure effective mechanisms for surplus reallocation to regions suffering from shortages thanks to promotion of exchange of goods within the EU, while maintaining economic, social and natural sustainability of agricultural production.","[Kolodziejczak, Malgorzata] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kolodziejczak, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland.",mkol@up.poznan.pl,"Kołodziejczak, Małgorzata/ABE-9746-2020","Kołodziejczak, Małgorzata/0000-0001-5615-5560",,,,,15,3,3,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,136,143,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800019,0

Although in the recent 2 decades EU dedicated a lot of efforts to diversify the rural economy and to provide other alternatives for employment and incomes, and to improve the territorial balance at the urban-rural axis, the agriculture is still the staple industry for rural areas. Meanwhile, the rural areas are characterized with higher unemployment rate compared to the national averages whereas the agriculture very often faces problems hiring not just qualified working force but also non-professional seasonal labour, which is denoted as unemployment paradox. The main goal of this research is to analyse how the changes in production structure of Bulgarian agriculture weigh on the employment development and income growth in the rural areas and why relatively high unemployment in rural areas co-exists with demand of labour in the agriculture - unemployment paradox. The analysis also aims to determine the current and prospective contribution of agriculture to the income development and employment opportunities in the Bulgarian rural areas. It also analyses the importance of the higher incomes in the rural areas for the labour intensive sectors - such as vegetable production and dairy farming. The main results confirm the interconnection between agriculture and income in the rural areas. Although the unemployment rates are not directly correlated to the shift in the Bulgarian production structure, it is still one of the main factors that is strongly correlated with labour productivity and demand of labour in the rural areas.","[Ivanov, Bozhidar; Sokolova, Emilia] Inst Agr Econ, 125 Tsarigradsko Shosse Blvd, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria",Agricultural Academy - Bulgaria,"Ivanov, B (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ, 125 Tsarigradsko Shosse Blvd, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",bozidar_ivanov@yahoo.co.uk; emilia.sokolova@iae-bg.com,"Ivanov, Bozhidar/HJP-4157-2023",,,,,,6,0,0,1,3,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

This order confronts increasing opposition, reflecting concerns about adjustment costs and distributional effects of globalization and the ability to pursue national policy goals. At the same time, the development of complex production relations distributed across many countries calls for cooperation on a variety of regulatory policies. Contrary to what is argued by opponents of globalization, this does not imply one-size-fits-all rules that constitute a threat to national sovereignty and democratic legitimation. There remains an important traditional integration agenda that centers on rule making by major trading powers on policies that generate negative international spillovers.

It is very important to utilize the land efficiently (mainly nowadays) when the competition increase in EU. The structure of farms differs significantly across Member States, and the physical size of farms is one of the indicators by which we can see these differences. For example, Slovakia is EU 28 leader in the average size of farm. But, determining the size of farms in terms of their agricultural area is just one of the approaches. In many cases more significant is to measure the economic size, which based on the indicator of standard output. Slovakia is also the leader in the amount of per hectare standard output. But, deeper analysis shows unexpected negative moderate relationship between these two variables, which can be defined as inverse. The main goal of this paper is to identify, whether the remuneration of subsidies is more suitable in connection to physical or to the economical size of farm (agricultural unit). Analysis is based on the FADN data from 2004-2015 period and includes 28 EU members. In this period total subsidies in EUR average per farm and the two indicators of farm size were analyzed: standard output (SO) in EUR.ha(-1) and utilized agricultural area (UAA) in hafarm(-1). The research shows that the remuneration of subsidy by the number of hectares of UAA results in big negative correlation for Slovakia, but when put into the correlation with standard output this resulted in moderate positive relationship. The simple no intercept regression analysis also showed better relationship of TS with SO than UAA. In conclusion it would be therefore more efficient to remunerate subsidies according to SO than UAA.","[Urbanova, Maria; Dobosova, Ludmila; Kozakova, Jana; Durisova, Eva; Ceryova, Dominika] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Urbánová, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",urbanovam@uniag.sk; ludmila.dobosova@uniag.sk; jana.kozakova@uniag.sk; xdurisovae@uniag.sk; dominika.ceryova@uniag.sk,"Bullová, Tatiana/AAL-6756-2020; Čeryová, Dominika/AAL-5526-2020; Kozáková, Jana/AAC-7916-2020","Kozáková, Jana/0000-0001-7913-9053",,,,,22,1,1,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,408,415,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800057,0

This review outlines the key characteristics of globalization and then details the changes occurring to agriculture and the broader agrifood system. It addresses the worldwide spread of productivist, specialized, industrial-style farming methods and their consequences, both positive and negative. The review focuses on three key issues: the world's capability to produce enough food to feed humankind; the important roles played in shaping globalization by transnational corporations, global finance, and government policies; and the emerging challenges to globalization. The first of these addresses the current debate regarding whether it is possible to maintain ecological diversity while producing sufficient food to feed the world. The other issue acknowledges that outcomes of global processes are spatially uneven and strongly contested by forms of agriculture antithetical to the homogenized, capitalist, neoliberal model associated with globalization.","[Robinson, Guy M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Robinson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",guy.robinson@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,162,27,31,6,73,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Nevertheless, there are also customers' demands beyond this framework for independent declaration of compliance not only with these legal requirements, but also with some of the preferred standards. These are frequently essential prerequisites in order to establish or maintain a customer-supplier relationship. The HACCP system is fundamental (essentially stipulated by the legal framework) and generally forms only the basis for other required standards, such as the GFSI, BRC, IFS, FSSC2200, and ISO 22000 norms or the GLOBAL.G.A.P. standard for primary production. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the key aspects which might influence the success rate and effectiveness of implemented systems to ensure food safety in food operations in the Czech Republic. The research methodology is based on using a modified version of the Delphi method as an experimental method for group problem solving. The panel comprises twelve experts specializing in food operations who are responsible for effective setting of the food safety system, expert consultants on correct implementation of the food safety system, university experts in this area as well as representatives from inspection and certification authorities. A questionnaire with closed-ended questions and the Likert scale, designed to measure attitudes and opinions, was the tool used in the research. The MaxAgr. software developed at the CULS Prague was used for evaluation. The research questions are as follows: Which aspects influence effectiveness of the implemented food safety system the most? Which aspect is considered key in terms of a potential negative consequence? Are certified solutions to these systems the key to increasing sales on the domestic and international market?","[Sanova, Petra] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kvasnicka, Roman] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kvasnickova-Stanislavska, Lucie] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Laputkova, Adriana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Languages, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Sánová, P (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",sanova@pef.czu.cz; kvasnicka@pef.czu.cz; kvasnickova@pef.czu.cz; laputkova@pef.czu.cz,"Laputkova, Adriana/AAV-7801-2020; Kvasničková Stanislavská, Lucie/R-8301-2017; Kvasnicka, Roman/R-8327-2017","Laputkova, Adriana/0000-0001-6483-9081; Kvasničková Stanislavská, Lucie/0000-0001-7360-8509; Kvasnicka, Roman/0000-0002-6707-1183",,,,,17,0,0,2,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,388,394,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800054,0

In the publication the statements and methods of solving the problems of disaggregation of FTI allowing calculating the indices of groups of significant goods and groups of other goods of export and import are described. The proposed index methods allow analyzing changes in the dynamics of these groups of goods taking into account the factors price-quantity-value. For approbation of methods the commodity Agricultural products and foodstuffs (APF) group (HS 01-24 codes) and a task of the analysis of export of goods of this group from the Czech Republic to the Russian Federation were considered. The information base for the analysis was the mirror statistics of Russia on the import of Czech goods to Russia. Based on the results of calculations, the analysis of aggregate FTI of goods from groups 01-24 was carried out with the allocation of an additional subgroup of goods with the greatest growth in the value of sales. The analysis of the state of Czech goods and goods of other non-CIS countries in the Russian market was also conducted. It was revealed that unlike the non-CIS countries, where the level of sales of APF in the Russian market as a whole decreased due to falling prices and sales volumes, the Czech Republic was able to ensure sales growth of agricultural products on the basis of practically stable prices and growth of natural supplies.","[Yurik, Sergey] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pushkin, Nikolay] Belarusian State Univ, Fac Econ, Minsk, BELARUS",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Belarusian State University,"Yurik, S (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",yurik@pef.czu.cz; nikolai_pushkin@mail.ru,"Yurik, Sergey/AAC-6671-2019","Pushkin, Nikolay/0000-0001-5425-8347; Yurik, Sergey/0000-0001-5174-0162","IGA, FEM, CULS Prague [20181018]","IGA, FEM, CULS Prague","The paper is processed with financial support of IGA, FEM, CULS Prague.

Adaptation to climate risks that can no longer be avoided is an important aspect of the global response to climate change. Humans have always adapted to changing climatic conditions, and there is growing, if still patchy, evidence of widespread adaptation behavior. However, adaptation is not autonomous as sometimes claimed. It requires knowledge, planning, coordination, and foresight. There are important knowledge gaps, behavioral barriers, and market failures that hold back effective adaptation and require policy intervention. We identify the most urgent adaptation priorities, including areas where delay might lock in future vulnerability, and outline the decision-making challenges of adapting to an unknown future climate. We also highlight the strong interlinkages between adaptation and economic development, pointing out that decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning, and infrastructure investment all have a strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change. We review the implications of these links for adaptation finance and what the literature tells us about the balance between adaptation and mitigation.","[Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fankhauser, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Fankhauser, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,150,44,50,120,573,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4709-3,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Farm resilience to such shocks is thus of crucial importance for food security. Improving resilience of farms in transition countries may be of a particular importance as these farms still suffer from high technical inefficiencies and structural weaknesses. This study addresses the issue of organizational resilience in Russian agricultural enterprises, and focuses on the differences between various legal forms - cooperatives, limited liability companies, and joint stock companies. Using financial statement data from farms in northwestern Russia from 2001 to 2012, descriptive analysis and a fixed-effect growth model, we investigate farm resilience in the form of post-2008 crisis sales growth robustness and recovery. The empirical results show a significant negative effect of the economic crisis on farm production and farm survival rate, both of which suggest low farm resilience. The recovery from the economic crisis was mainly driven by farm restructuring, in which the formation of limited liability companies played a significant role. Profitability (performance) was also found to significantly increase farm resilience; not necessarily farm robustness, but farms' speed of recover from the negative consequences of the economic shock.","[Curtiss, Jarmila] TC ASCR, Leibniz, Germany; [Curtiss, Jarmila; Epshtein, David] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Leibniz, Germany; [Epshtein, David; Unay-Gailhard, Ilkay] Russian Acad Sci, North West Inst Agr Econ, Moscow, Russia",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Russian Academy of Sciences,"Curtiss, J (通讯作者)，TC ASCR, Leibniz, Germany.;Curtiss, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Leibniz, Germany.",curtiss@tc.cz; gagalyuk@iamo.de; epsteindb@gmail.com; unaygailhard@iamo.de,"Epstein, David Berkovich/E-2298-2016",,IAMO; Leibniz Association,IAMO; Leibniz Association,This work was carried out during Jarmila Curtiss' visiting research fellow position and David Epshtein's research stay at the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO).

Since the 1990s, a literature has emerged arguing that these gaps not only are inequitable but also reduce economic performance. This review finds that, first, it is methodologically difficult to determine reliable effects of gender gaps on economic performance. Second, accounting studies that calculate how much larger GDP would be if gender gaps in employment disappeared vastly overestimate likely effects. Third, the theoretical literature has generated important insights on mechanisms linking gender gaps to economic performance. Fourth, systematic reviews of the cross-country evidence robustly show that lowering gender gaps in education leads to higher economic performance, while the literature on the impact of other gaps is much more limited. Fifth, there is accumulating micro evidence on how reducing particular gender gaps at the level of households, farms, or firms can improve economic performance in particular contexts, with robust results in some areas, and less clear evidence in others.","[Klasen, Stephan] Univ Goettingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",sklasen@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,94,43,50,7,49,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4710-9,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The exact causes and the extent of food losses and food waste vary throughout the world. The main objective of this paper is to provide a regional assessment of the scale of food losses and food waste along the entire food supply chain. Quantitative food loss, which is analysed in this paper, is defined as the decrease in the quantity of food available for human consumption throughout the different segments of the supply chain Food waste refers to the removal from the food supply chain of food which is fit for consumption, or which has spoiled or expired. According to the FAO data, 32% of all food produced in the world was lost or wasted in 2009 (in terms of weight). If we converted the FAO's estimates into calories, global food loss and waste amounts to approximately 24% of all food produced. The distribution of food losses and waste varies significantly between developed and developing regions. Regionally, about 56% of total food losses and waste occur in the developed world, whereas the developing world accounts for 44% of the losses. In the developed countries most food losses and waste occur at the retail and consumption stage, whereas in the developing countries food is lost mainly during the early stages of the food supply chain It should be noted that only a combined effort by farmers, the food industry, retailers and consumers made along the entire supply chain can contribute to improving food security at the global level.","[Pawlak, Karolina; Krysztofiak, Julia] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Pawlak, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy Agribusiness, Poznan, Poland.",pawlak@up.poznan.pl; julia.krysztofiak@up.poznan.pl,"Pawlak, Karolina/ABE-9279-2020","Pawlak, Karolina/0000-0002-5441-6381",,,,,24,1,1,2,37,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,229,235,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800032,0

The study was conducted on a sample of 4,172 messages from 2,096 unique posters. Messages were captured as Instagram social media communications using Netlytic software. Based on the Eigenvector Centrality analysis, four of the most significant characteristics that Instagram users communicate in connection with the hashtag #safefood have been identified: 1) Healthyfood (Healthy) 2) glutenfree 3) vegan and 4) organic. These results can be used by food producers focusing on healthy foods in their marketing as well as their portfolio management. It is significant that for customers in the Safe Food area, it is more important that a product be gluten-free than organic, which can be related to the growing number of people on gluten-free diet and celiac disease.","[Pilar, Ladislav; Polakova, Jana; Rojik, Stanislav] CULSPrague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Gresham, George] Jacksonville Univ, Davis Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL USA",Jacksonville University,"Pilar, L (通讯作者)，CULSPrague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",pilarl@pef.czu.cz; polakovaj@pef.czu.cz; rojiks@pef.czu.cz; ggresha1@ju.edu,"Rojík, Stanislav/D-1663-2017","Rojík, Stanislav/0000-0002-3506-8799","IGA PEF CZU (CULS) - Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda [20171033, 00001959]",IGA PEF CZU (CULS) - Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda,"This research article was supported by IGA PEF CZU (CULS) 20171033 -Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda, Nr. 00001959.",,24,2,2,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,236,242,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800033,0

An important issue is to ensure that subsidiary administrative processes are in compliance with the key processes - this is one factor supporting process management and the need to ensure enterprise performance. A subsidiary aim of the research is to identify and define a competence model for administrative employees in the field of agriculture. The design of documentation for the competence model is important for providing efficient support for key processes. The research for this article was developed using quantitative research methods. Data were obtained by means of an electronic questionnaire (N=980). For data evaluation a mixture of statistical methods was used. Firstly, categorial variables were analysed by means of frequencies. Secondly, the Pearson Chi-Square test in contingency tables was used for testing hypotheses and correlation analysis was used for measuring the strength of relationship. Employees in the field of agriculture mainly need professional skills and specific knowledge, rather than general skills, to be able to design documentation effectively. Ensuring that employees have the appropriate level of professional skills is one of the main requirements for the effective design of documentation. This is one of the key requirements for providing effective support for organizational processes, to ensure high performance in an enterprise.","[Venclova, Katerina; Kriz, Josef] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Jindrova, Andrea] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Venclová, K (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",venclovak@pef.czu.cz; krizj@pef.czu.cz; jindrova@pef.czu.cz,"Drahotová, Kateřina/AAV-3366-2020","Drahotová, Kateřina/0000-0002-6032-2488",,,,,25,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,423,429,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800059,0

The theoretical framework of submitted paper was carried out by means of scientific and professional papers and supported by contemporary information coming from relevant Internet resources. The method of studying documents was used. The primary data was obtained by means of quantitative research, using a questionnaire survey. In the whole amount of respondents (n=1220) there were 47 % of men and 53 % of women. They were 18-year-old and older inhabitants from general population living in the Czech Republic. The questionnaire survey was conducted in autumn 2016. The results show that when buying foods, the respondents make the final decision according to the following significant factors: price (59 %) and pleasure (35 %). The responses the awareness of food ingredients and the importance to health were chosen by one third of respondents approximately, and the response the food origins was chosen by one fourth of respondents approximately.

Its turnover value increased from 118 bil. CZK to 426 bil. CZK. The goal of this article is to identify significant changes that occurred in its territorial and commodity structure in relation to the EU and third countries. In addition, the analysis also includes an element that is related to the development and condition of unit prices (CZK/kg) and the physical volume (in kg) of agrarian trade. This paper is based on the application of standard comparative advantage instruments such as the LFI, RCA and TBI indices. The basic source of data for the analyses is the CZSO foreign trade database. The most noteworthy partners of the Czech agrarian trade are the developed countries, particularly the member countries of the OECD (more than 90% of trade value) and more specifically the EU28 (trade turnover is about 376 bil. CZK/year). Based on the overview of the results, which originate from the analysis of the relationship between exports and imports, it is possible to detect the deterioration of the coverage of unit prices of import by the unit prices of export (from 70% to 42%). The basic pillars of Czech agrarian trade comparative advantages and competitiveness in relation to EU countries, respectively third countries are the following aggregations (positive values of LFI a TBI index): cereals, tobacco products, living animals, dairy, beverages, oil seeds, animal and vegetable fats, sweeteners, oleaginous fruits, seeds and fruit industrial plants and fodder, cereal preparations, starch or milk pastry cooks' products. In period 2001-2016 the export value of above mentioned aggregations increased from 23 bil. CZK up to 124 bil.

Perceived self-efficacy (PSE)-individuals' perception of their domain-specific capabilities-fundamentally shapes these internal constraints and thereby drives economic behavior. Without sufficient PSE, individuals have little reason to invest greater effort or attempt anything new. Individuals with higher PSE set more ambitious goals, try harder, and persist more diligently. Such proactive engagement in perceiving and creating possibilities is often either ignored or implicitly assumed in simple optimization models. Growing evidence from psychology and economics suggests that PSE deserves greater attention. We review the theoretical and empirical literature on PSE with a focus on its relevance to poverty and economic development. We discuss promising avenues for future research at the interface of PSE and poverty as part of the broader frontier of behavioral development economics.","[Wuepper, David] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr Econ, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Lybbert, Travis J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Technical University of Munich; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Wuepper, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Agr Econ, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",david.wuepper@tum.de,,"Wuepper, David/0000-0002-1344-6023",,,,,126,52,66,7,59,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4709-3,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

But these regulators often lack the capacity to implement, monitor, and enforce CAC and MBI policies. As a result, the efficacy of those policies is an empirical matter. We review emerging experimental and quasi-experimental evidence on CAC and MBI policies in developing countries, specifically, from 32 studies of CAC policies and 8 studies of MBIs. Although drawn from a small and decidedly nonrandom sample of countries and policy types, the evidence clearly indicates that CAC and MBI policies can have significant environmental benefits in developing countries.

The research is based on data of the Land Survey Office in Prague, the Czech Statistical Office, Farm Accountancy Data Network, official prices of agricultural land based on public notice of the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic, information of the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Research Institute for Soil and Water conservation. There were used methods of comparison, correlation and index analyses to process the data. The selected factors which could have some impact on the soil quality are; 1) Grown crops on fields (there were selected perennial fodder crops and maize for grain). 2) The extent of rented land. 3) Investments to land. The regions with the highest decrease of of the official price of agricultural land (2009-2018) are: Zlinsky, Moravskoslezsky, Jihomoravsky, Olomoucky, and Stredocesky region. The official land price slightly increased or didn't change in these regions: Vysocina, Kralovehradecky, Ustecky, Jihocesky. The correlation analysis found that the official prices are influenced by the extent of grown maize for grain. There weren't founded correlation between the official price and the other factors. The analysis of documents of the Czech Chamber of Commerce have found that significant decrease of the official prices (more than 10 %) are based from 60.6 % on negative anthropogenic factors (erosion processes caused by intensive agricultural production (40.15 % of cases), the influence of other agricultural processes (17.42 %), and floods (3.03 %)).

It has been found that this self-sufficiency has fallen since 1991, on average by 1.4 % per year. In connection with this phenomenon, the following research questions have been asked: (i) which factors are essential explanatory variables, (ii) which one of these factors is most effective and (iii) is there a long-term relationship between the variables? The source of data was the time series of the CZSO and the Ministry of Agriculture from 1991 to 2017. As a tool of exploration, a simple LRM model was used, including cointegration analysis of time series to determine long-term relations between values. Significant variables influencing the changes in self-sufficiency were the export and import of milk in millions of litres and number of heads of dairy cows. The results determined the non-elastic responses of self-sufficiency to changes in these variables. Nevertheless, the most sensitively self-sufficiency responds to exports (export elasticity coefficient 0.4 %), followed by imports (-0.23 %) and the number of cows (-0.06).","[Mach, Jiri; Halova, Pavlina] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Mach, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",mach@pef.czu.cz; halova@pef.czu.cz,"Hálová, Pavlína/H-6831-2018; Mach, Jiri/H-4657-2018","Mach, Jiri/0000-0002-0526-4246",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,153,158,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800021,0

As the study results shows, in spite of dynamic growth of the organic agricultural area and number of organic farms, the production volume and the offer in retail remained quite narrow. Considering consumers, quality, taste and health properties of organic food are vital for them. They rather live in cities, have more than average incomes and are mostly interested in purchase of fruit, vegetables or meat. However, only specialist shops have sufficient product range to fulfil the consumers' expectations. Other retailers' offer mostly limits to selected processed products, which mainly results from low level of production and processing. Therefore, large part of the offer must be imported. This reflects in high price of organic food in relation to conventional, which, in terms of relatively small consumers' incomes, lowers the demand quantity.","[Smoluk-Sikorska, Joanna; Luczka, Wladyslawa] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Smoluk-Sikorska, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ, Poznan, Poland.",smoluk@up.poznan.pl; luczka@up.poznan.pl,"Smoluk-Sikorska, Joanna/J-5187-2019","Smoluk-Sikorska, Joanna/0000-0001-9599-0497",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [NN112 385440],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The research in the distribution sphere was funded by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education within the research project No NN112 385440 State and Condition of the Development of the Organic Food Retail.,,19,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,326,332,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800045,0

We also focus on the barriers that stand out and hamper the possibilities of continuing education for managers today. At a time of high competition, when businesses have the same or similar technologies, the processes of the company, whether they are innovations, customers, production, but also sales efficiency, and others, are decisive for the success of the enterprise. This is why agricultural businesses should invest in the development of their employees. Investing in human resources leads to their overall appreciation, in particular through increased staffing and service levels, increased business competitiveness, employability of own resources to meet the needs of employees, self-reliance and employee satisfaction, loyalty to the company, time savings and financial costs. Formation of work skills goes beyond the limits of qualifications and increasingly involves shaping the social and personal characteristics of employees (behavior, attitudes, motivation and work performance). Therefore, education and the formation of work knowledge and skills should be considered as a lifelong process and an important part of personal work.","[Polakovic, Peter; Hennyeyova, Klara; Hallova, Marcela] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat, Nitra, Slovakia; [Silerova, Edita; Vanek, Jiri] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Polakovic, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat, Nitra, Slovakia.",peter.polakovic@uniag.sk; klara.hennyeyov@uniag.sk; silerova@pef.czu.cz; marcela.hallova@uniag.sk; vanek@pef.czu.cz,"Vaněk, Jiří/H-5280-2018",,"Internal grant agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [2017023]","Internal grant agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague","The results and knowledge included herein have been obtained owing to support from the following institutional grant.

While trade barriers are being steadily reduced, the attention has been shifted on food safety standards, which subsequently have a direct effect on the access of developing countries in global markets. Substantial investments in the field of food safety standards are required to be implemented in developing countries, so that the output is in accordance with the regulatory requirements and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures. In reality, the developed countries set the regulations which apply in trade; hence, the burden falls in the developing countries. As a result, due to the lack of sufficient resources, Kosovo is failing to comply with international practices and regulations. Given the complexity of the topic, the UNIDO cost benefit approach was undertaken. The approach measures three indicators of a country's standard compliance capacity: i) import rejection data; ii) buyers' perceptions on the compliance capacity; and iii) Trade Standards Compliance Capacity Index. As such, a comprehensive picture on Kosovo's compliance with the food safety standards was created. A consensus among researchers has been reached in highlighting that the exports of developing countries are negatively affected from the food safety standards In accordance, the model shows that SPS measures are highly subjective and allow room for interpretation; therefore, there is room for manipulation. Throughout history, Kosovo has been denied access to export markets under the pretext of failing to meet the food safety standards and regulations. However, findings show that buyers are optimistic on the potential benefits which may derive from imposing food safety standards Last but not least, the findings show that Kosovo needs more financial and technical support in complying with the safety regulations and standards.","[Sahatqija, Jeta; Maitah, Mansoor] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Sahatqija, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",sahatqija@pef.czu.cz; maitah@pef.czu.cz,"Maitah, Mansoor/G-7556-2014","Maitah, Mansoor/0000-0003-2797-3155",,,,,12,0,0,1,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,311,317,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800043,0

Self-sufficiency was calculated according to share of domestic production and domestic consumption. The results show that the Czech Republic is self-sufficient in the case of sugar and rape. In the case of sunflower there is a decrease in self-sufficiency in the analysed period due to the decrease of the sown areas and the growth in the domestic consumption. Slovakia is self-sufficient in all monitored commodities - except for small fluctuations in sugar. Hungary is self-sufficient in the case of rape and sunflower. The situation differs in the case of sugar. The rate of self-sufficiency is gradually increasing over the reporting period, but this indicator was only 50% in 2016. Poland is, except for minor fluctuations, fully self-sufficient in sugar and rape. Sunflower is a minor crop in Poland, which is also reflected in the results of the self-sufficiency rate. This rate has a declining tendency over the analysed period, ranging from 21% to 3%.

In general, food production is growing steadily. However, the bakery industry experiences a decline in bread consumption. In addition, bakeries are negatively influenced by various economic effects. E.g. after 2009, a number of bakery producers claimed that the sharp rise in their main material (flour) significantly reduces their profitability. The rise in flour prices stopped around 2012 and, lately, the price of flour declines again though not back to pre-2009 levels. The aim of this paper is to identify future developments in bread consumption. The partial objective will be to compare the consumption forecasts obtained using different forecasting methods and to identify other causes that influence the development of the bakery industry and its economic stability. Several methods are used to predict bread consumption. In order for them to be comparable with each other, the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) is provided for each method. The used methods are the sliding average method, the Holt method, the linear and exponential regressions. The forecast was based on the period from 1996 to 2016, i.e. for the period when complete and relevant data from the Czech Statistical Office are available.Results of the quantitative research show that the most accurate estimate of future bread consumption provides the use of a Holt method; it gives the results with a great precision. Nevertheless, this prediction procedure is far from sufficient for ensuring the future economic stability of bakery companies. Finally, the Discussion offers other factors influencing bread consumption.","[Zemanova, Petra; Strachotova, Dana; Botek, Marek] UCT Prague, Dept Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Zemanová, P (通讯作者)，UCT Prague, Dept Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",petra.zemanova@vscht.cz; dana.strachotova@vscht.cz; marek.botek@vscht.cz,"Botek, marek/M-6637-2019","Botek, marek/0000-0002-5941-3040",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2890-7,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2018,,,,,,,459,465,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO3XF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000512313800064,0

A dramatic increase in the volatility of milk prices received by dairy farmers has adversely affected dairy farm profitability. Furthermore, the effects that the private Exchange spot cheese market has on FMMOs milk pricing have raised concerns, mostly due to an imperfectly competitive nature of competition process in this market. This research analyzes the behavior of Class III milk price, which is the mover of the overall FMMOs pricing structure, during three milk pricing regimes: Minnesota-Wisconsin price series (1960s-1995), Basic Formula Price (1995-1999), and Multiple Component Pricing (2000-present). The empirical evidence presented in the article indicates that changes in the level of Class III milk price were rather minor in magnitude. However, changes in the milk price volatility were dramatic. There is empirical evidence indicating that the private Exchange spot cheese price is the main determinant of the Class III milk price, which is consistent with the design of Class III milk pricing during the analyzed FMMOs milk pricing regimes.

Two price equations are deduced from simultaneous partial equilibria of the endogenous variables and are embedded in a VECM to account for a long-run cointegration relationship. The model is estimated via the Kalman-Filter to allow for time variation in the long-run parameters, and a dynamic factor model used to extract a common factor from the time-variant coefficients. The results are then used to calculate the industry average input conjectural elasticities. The framework is applied to German dairy value chain data over the time period of January 2000 to March 2011. The results indicate almost perfect competition in the raw milk market and imperfect competition in the dairy output market, which is however far from monopsony.

In French viticulture, most of the production is done under an appellation regime that constrains maximum authorized yields. We consider a trans-log cost function under the constraint of this maximum yield and estimate winegrowers' attitudes to risk. Our estimates are based on the European Farm Accountancy Data Network database (2005-2014) and data from the French National Institute of Origin and Quality. We find that winegrowers are risk averse. For the majority of winegrowers, risk aversion is declining with expected profit. In the Champagne region, however, where expected profits are far higher than in the other regions, we observe the reverse relation: winegrowers become more risk averse as expected profits rise.","[Aka, Joel] Irstea & Bordeaux Sci Agro, 1 Cours Gen Gaulle, F-33175 Gradignan, France; [Ugaglia, Adeline Alonso] Bordeaux Sci Agro, UMR 1065 SAVE, 1 Cours Gen Gaulle, F-33175 Gradignan, France; [Lescot, Jean-Marie] Irstea, UR ETBX, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France",INRAE; INRAE,"Aka, J (通讯作者)，Irstea & Bordeaux Sci Agro, 1 Cours Gen Gaulle, F-33175 Gradignan, France.",joel.aka@agro-bordeaux.fr; adeline.ugaglia@gro-bordeaux.fr; jean-marie.lescot@irstea.fr,"ALONSO UGAGLIA, Adeline/M-7422-2019","ALONSO UGAGLIA, Adeline/0000-0003-4520-3330",French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program [ANR-10-EQPX-17]; Bordeaux Sciences Agro; Irstea,French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Bordeaux Sciences Agro; Irstea,We are indebted to an anonymous reviewer for comments and suggestions that helped to improve this paper.

Our methodology is twofold. First, we study comparative advantages in 16 countries using Porter's diamond. Then, we report results from a survey in which wine economists are asked to assess the future trade performance of these countries. Results are relatively consistent across methods regarding the future heavy weights like China, but also New Zealand and Chile, countries show the greatest potential to succeed in the future global wine trade. It is also expected that Georgia, the United Kingdom, and Australia play an important role, although to a lesser extent. Our findings indicate that comparative advantages in wine trade are neither uniform nor static; especially, terroir is no longer sufficient. The diamond approach contradicts experts from two countries in particular, France and Argentina, suggesting that experts put great emphasis on demand and market structures as key trade determinants for the future.","[Bargain, Olivier; Cardebat, Jean-Marie; Chiappini, Raphael; Laffitte, Corentin] Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Ave L Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Cardebat, Jean-Marie] INSEEC U, H19, Bordeaux, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Bargain, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Ave L Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",olivier.bargain@u-bordeaux.fr; jean-marie.cardebat@u-bordeaux.fr; raphael.chiappini@u-bordeaux.fr; corentin.laffitte@u-bordeaux.fr,"Chiappini, Raphaël/JNR-8433-2023; Cardebat, Jean-Marie/JED-5290-2023; Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019","Chiappini, Raphaël/0000-0003-4819-8792;",,,,,14,8,8,4,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

In particular, we are interested in examining whether Fairtrade wines are different from non-Fairtrade wines. Because Fairtrade wines serve an additional social purpose, one may think that consumers search less aggressively for the outlet with the lowest price, thus allowing for a larger price dispersion than for regular wines. We draw on data for about seven thousand wines from South Africa, Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade, sold in the United Kingdom between 2007 and 2012. In a first step, we run a hedonic regression model explaining the wine prices using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Instrumental Variable (IV) approaches. In the next step, we regress the squared residuals from the first step on a Fairtrade 0-1 dummy-variable. When using the squared residuals from the OLS model, we find that Fairtrade is a negative determinant of price dispersion. Therefore, Fairtrade wines exhibit a significant lower price dispersion than the comparison group. When using the squared residuals from the IV model, we find mixed results and suspect the presence of a substantial bias due to weak instruments. Finally, in order to avoid IV pitfalls, we ran Fairtrade and Non-Fairtrade wines in separate equations. We find support for the OLS results, i.e., Fairtrade wines appear to exhibit lower price dispersion than their non-Fairtrade counterparts. Whether this is due to consumer search is a priori unclear.","[Niklas, Britta] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Dev Res & Dev Policy, Univ Str 105, D-44789 Bochum, Germany; [Storchmann, Karl] NYU, Econ Dept, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Ruhr University Bochum; New York University; Stellenbosch University,"Niklas, B (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Dev Res & Dev Policy, Univ Str 105, D-44789 Bochum, Germany.",britta.niklas@rub.de; karl.storchmann@nyu.edu; nv@sun.ac.za,"Niklas, Britta/AAB-4219-2020; Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Niklas, Britta/0000-0002-7804-309X;",,,,,12,6,6,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

Despite those differences, dozens of state fair and other wine competitions determine winners' ribbons, medals, scores, and ranks by pooling the opinions of female and male judges. This article examines twenty-three blind wine tastings during which female and male judges scored more than nine hundred wines. Two-sample t-test results show that the gender-specific distributions of scores do have similar means and standard deviations. Exact p-values for two-sample chi-square tests show that the distributions of men's and women's scores are not significantly different, and exact p-values for likelihood ratio tests of Plackett-Luce model results show that the genders' preference orders are not significantly different. The correlation coefficient between women's and men's scores is weakly positive in 90 percent of the tastings. On that evidence, indications that the genders prefer different wines are difficult to detect. If such differences do exist, as the nonwine literature implies, the results of this analysis show that those differences are small compared to non-gender-related idiosyncratic differences between individuals and random expressions of preference. The potential for accept-a-false-null-hypothesis Type II error when pooling female and male judges' wine-related opinions appears to be small.","[Bodington, Jeffrey C.] Bodington & Co, 50 Calif St 630, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Bodington, JC (通讯作者)，Bodington & Co, 50 Calif St 630, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",jcb@bodington-andcompany.com,,,,,,,31,5,6,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

A rank-ordered logit model was used to assess the effects of price- and quantity-based contract mechanisms, risk preferences, and farm characteristics on ranking of contract preferences. Our empirical results show that, under price-based contract, farmers are likely to prefer contract that set fixed price when a contract was offered over short term, however, over the long term, farmers prefer a contract item that set formula with a floor price. Under quantity-based design mechanism, our model results illustrate that contract items that limit biomass quantity delivery requirement become less preferable even if farmers are allowed to negotiate on delivery price. In addition, farmer's risk perception factors toward engaging in marketing organization and vertically coordinated supply chains play a significant role in ranking contract preferences.

Many producers in the northern United States are attracted to aquaponics for its potential to produce indoors year-round. However, little is known about consumer preferences for products grown in aquaponic systems. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an experimental auction to measure the impact of information about production method on consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for lettuce. For most participants, WTP was similar for both aquaponic and soil grown lettuce with overall average bids of $1.47 per 8 ounces and $1.48 per 8 ounces, respectively. Learning how samples were grown (either aquaponic or soil-grown) rarely changed bids significantly, although on average, participants with environmental group membership lowered their bids for aquaponic lettuce samples. In general, higher frequency shoppers expressed higher average WTP for all types of lettuce.

Perceived hops quality (hoppiness) is one of the main attributes that micro-brewers alter to differentiate their products to satisfy consumers' changing tastes and preferences. We hypothesize that, in addition to manipulating beer-processing conditions, the conditions under which the hops are grown may also influence the final sensory properties of the beer. Using hops from a field experiment coupled with sensory attributes and sociode-mographic characteristics from a contingent valuation survey, we analyzed the impact of under-fertilized hop treatments during the growing season on consumers' willingness to pay for beer. The results indicate that uninformed consumers in a blind tasting could identify the differences in beer made from hops across the fertilization treatments and, thus, implying that all else equal sufficient fertilizer is required to achieve satisfactory hoppiness for which consumers are willing to pay.","[Gabrielyan, Gnel] Cornell Univ, Coll Business, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Marsh, Thomas L.; McCluskey, Jill J.] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ross, Carolyn F.] Washington State Univ, Sch Food Sci, Food Sci & Human Nutr Bldg, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Cornell University; Washington State University; Washington State University,"Gabrielyan, G (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Coll Business, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",gg352@cornell.edu; tl_marsh@wsu.edu; mccluskey@wsu.edu; cfross@wsu.edu,,,USDA-SCRI grant; Agronomic and Biochemical Impacts of Biotic and Abiotic Stress on Pacific Northwest Flavor Crops,USDA-SCRI grant; Agronomic and Biochemical Impacts of Biotic and Abiotic Stress on Pacific Northwest Flavor Crops,This article was supported by an USDA-SCRI grant; Agronomic and Biochemical Impacts of Biotic and Abiotic Stress on Pacific Northwest Flavor Crops.

It employs group concept mapping, a mixed methods-based approach. Given the limited research on the economic conceptualization of horizontal coordination for guiding collective strategic action orientations, this contribution is threefold: methodological, empirical, and practical. Methodologically, the results show the perspective of horizontally coordinated cidermakers and use statistical estimates and retroduction as an inference mode to produce and structure the concept map. Empirically, the spatial economic conceptualization consists of a concept map with seven strategic action clusters organized around the notions of product supply and demand and highlights tensions between individual and collective strategic actions. Practically, measures of relative importance and relative feasibility are obtained for each cluster on the map, and implications are discussed.","[Cloutier, L.

We provide a comparative analysis of the retailers' liability rule-based accountability and the liability rule polluter pays, which penalizes an operator who is directly responsible for a noncompliant product. We show that choosing the optimal liability rule is a complex problem, as the choice depends on the effectiveness of food safety controls and on the magnitude of the fine associated with rejecting noncompliant products.

Because PMP is not straightforward if farmers are assumed to maximize expected utility (as a risk parameter also needs to be calibrated), we consider possible ways to address this issue but settle on a traditional approach used in the EU's Farm System Simulator. We calibrate farm management models for six different Alberta regions and use it to determine how changes in the AgriStability's payment trigger affect production incentives. Results indicate that, although the initial introduction of the AgriStability program in 2008 might have tilted farmers' planting decisions toward crops with higher returns and greater risk, changes to this program reduce indemnities and farmers' expected profits, but do not further alter land-use decisions. Rather, it is increases in farmers' aversion to risk that lead to the greatest changes in crop allocation. [EconLit citations: Q14, Q18, C61].","[Liu, Xuan; Duan, Jun; van Kooten, G.

Econometric models used in this study consider potential nonlinearity and asymmetry in price transmissions using threshold autoregression and threshold error correction methods, and generalized impulse response functions. Overall, the surge of corn ethanol production after the EPA enactment appears to lead lower integration and slower price adjustment between markets, particularly between noncorn-belt and corn-belt markets. Our analysis also finds strong evidence of the existence of threshold effects and limited evidence of asymmetric price responses in the short and long run for both pre- and post-EPA periods.

Results for four wine tastings that include blind replicates are examined in this article. Although perfection is rare, the probability distributions of those results show that wine judges do tend to assign closer ratings to replicates than is likely due to chance alone. Approximately one-third of judges assign ratings that are within one rank of perfect consistency, and two-thirds assign ratings within two ranks of perfect consistency. This finding is sensitive to judges' capabilities, the mechanics of the tasting protocol, and the extent to which the replicate is different from other wines in the tasting. Much wine-related research to date takes judges' individual ratings as deterministic, yet these results show that those ratings are stochastic. These results yield a probability distribution that may guide future research concerning the uses and economic implications of wine ratings.","[Bodington, Jeffrey C.] Bodington & Co, 50 Calif St, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Bodington, JC (通讯作者)，Bodington & Co, 50 Calif St, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",jcb@bodingtonandcom-pany.com,,,,,,,18,7,7,2,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

Our analysis reveals that cooperative membership has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple price, gross income, farm profit, and ROI. In addition, we find that the highest profit effect of cooperative membership does not in fact result in the highest ROI effect of the membership, revealing differences in farm income and profitability of investment.

Both presentations ranked safety as the most important, taste as the second most important, and convenience as the least important meat purchasing attribute.

To do so, we apply LML methods to cross-sectional, farm-level data collected from a sample of 60 Egyptian farms.

The exit behavior meant establishing a marketing or processing operation in parallel to cooperative deliveries or the planning such an action. Scale development to measure cooperative attributes resulted in six latent variables: A need to restructure the farm business, the membership role in the cooperative, opportunity, fear of negative evaluation, self-efficacy, and cooperative (dis)loyalty. The latent variables identified were tested against behavioral intentions in two logistic regressions where the dairy farmers' plans for remaining or exiting the cooperative and their plans for postfarm gate entrepreneurial activities were the dependent variables. Two latent variables emerged as significant predictors: restructuring the farm business and the membership role. These predictors were push factors in the model, suggesting that dissatisfaction with delivery to existing dairy cooperatives, rather than job or life satisfaction from setting up their own business, acted as farmers' motive to exit. These results can be used in developing communication and strategies for more viable dairy cooperatives and in understanding the incentives behind the ongoing restructuring of the dairy market from a supply perspective.

In northeast Asia those statistics are exaggerated for a combination of several reasons. One is a labelling issue: imported bulk wine is able to be added to domestically produced wine without the front label having to declare the bottle may contain foreign product. Similar freedom applies to wine made from imported grape juice concentrate. A second (particularly in China) is a double-counting issue: domestic wine produced in one region of the country may be blended with wine produced in and packaged for final sale from another region, with both regions claiming it as their contribution to national wine output. A third possibility is a smuggling issue: some wine re-exports and imports are unrecorded. These possibilities of the wine market being exaggerated are significant for firms seeking to export to and sell in such countries, especially in the fast-growing ones of northeast Asia. This article shows the extent to which estimates for the region could change for such indicators as per capita wine consumption, wine self-sufficiency, and the region's share of global wine consumption, when alternative assumptions are made in response to these issues.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Wine Econ Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Harada, Kimie] Chuo Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Harada, Kimie] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University; Chuo University; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Wine Econ Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",anderson@adelaide.edu.au; kimie.hara.harada@gmail.com,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,15,12,13,2,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

Such constraints may be overcome by the adoption of organizational innovations, including collaborative structures such as joint venture (JV) arrangements. Given the predominance of the owner-operator family farm model in the Australian grains sector, organizational innovations have largely been overlooked by the research and extension community. This paper examines business alliance formation in agriculture and farmer perceptions of, interest in, and barriers to participation in JV structures. A telephone survey of 573 Australian grain growers revealed that 3% of farmers had adopted a JV structure and that such farms were significantly more likely to have a larger crop area and be less diversified compared to nonadopters. Another 21% of farmers expressed an interest in adopting a JV structure in the future, particularly to reduce costs and improve productivity. A multinomial logit model showed that such farmers were significantly different for a number of sociodemographic variables including age and education, when compared to farmers not interested in adopting JV structures. To build on this basis of interest and motivation for innovative farm business structures, further understanding of perceived trade-offs and preferences is needed to identify the most attractive JV designs.","[Lynch, Brendan; Umberger, Wendy J.] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Lynch, Brendan; Llewellyn, Rick S.] CSIRO, Locked Bag 2, Glen Osmond, SA 5064, Australia; [Llewellyn, Rick S.; Kragt, Marit E.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Llewellyn, Rick S.; Kragt, Marit E.] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Adelaide; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Llewellyn, RS (通讯作者)，CSIRO, Glen Osmond, SA 5005, Australia.",rick.llewellyn@csiro.au,"Llewellyn, Rick S/F-8068-2010; Umberger, Wendy/HSF-2064-2023; Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011","Llewellyn, Rick S/0000-0002-4152-7699; Umberger, Wendy/0000-0003-4159-7782; Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817",,,,,57,7,7,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2018,34.0,2,,,,,472,491,,10.1002/agr.21525,0.0,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,GE0NP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430911700019,0

Agricultural technical education is differentiated as training through a short course and additional personal guidance both offered through agricultural extension agencies. Results show that training alone may generate the desired result of reducing fertilizer usage. However, additional personal guidance does not support the intended goal of reducing the application of either fertilizer or pesticide. This study also detects technology diffusion effect in that farmers who are not offered education but are in the same village where the education programs are offered are more likely to change their behavior. Implications of this study call for better supervision and implementation of agricultural extension efforts in China.

Using farm-level data from Nepal and a nonparametric matching estimator, the study finds a negative and significant effect of CF on employment. However, CF through cooperatives has a positive and significant impact on profits, and yield. We find that small farms (0.51ha) with contracts tend to gain in profits and yield per hectare. However, large farms (>0.85 ha) with contracts employ significantly less hired labor per hectare. Finally, our estimates reveal that, compared to independent producers, smallholder households in Nepal that engaged in CF with both input and output conditions received, on average, higher profits and yield.

This paper distinguishes production uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty in examining four kinds of business relationships of Chinese vegetable farmers: market exchange, cooperative membership without marketing transaction, cooperative membership with marketing transaction, and contract farming. We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

We select Japanese consumers as an example because Japan is the world's largest chicken importer. The additional willingness to pay is estimated to be 38.87 JPY (about 0.39 USD)/150 g (when food poisoning levels reduced from 1/500 to 1/1,000) and 80.29 JPY (about 0.80 USD)/150 g (1/2,000). These values are high enough to cover additional associated costs, implying that producers' spontaneous provision of Campylobacter-reduced chicken is feasible. Our study is the first to confirm this fact.

Using a price decomposition method with distributed lags, we test imperfect reversibility and asymmetric price responses. Empirical models consisted of prices coupled with promotions and prices decoupled from promotions to determine the effect of trade promotions on retail prices. The results showed that the demand for OJ was imperfectly price reversible when we used prices coupled with promotion, and asymmetric price responses were found in not from concentrated OJ demand. Prices coupled with promotions were more elastic than prices decoupled from promotions. The demand for OJ was influenced by both current and previous information. Dynamic adjustments toward price and promotions may result in irreversibility. Competitions with price reduction increase sales in the short run, but frequent promotions may lead to lower reference prices that eventually weaken consumer willingness to purchase at regular prices without promotions.","[Kim, Hyeyoung] Oregon Employment Dept, Salem, OR 97311 USA; [Zansler, Marisa] Florida Dept Citrus, Econ & Market Res, Gainesville, FL USA; [House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Oregon Employment Dept, Salem, OR 97311 USA.",Hyeyoung.Kim@Oregon.gov; mzansler@ufl.edu; lahouse@ufl.edu,"House, Lisa/V-5724-2017","House, Lisa/0000-0002-1901-6550",,,,,28,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2018,34.0,2,,,,,363,376,,10.1002/agr.21523,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,GE0NP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430911700012,0

Data shows that campaign contributions from the wine industry to officials running for state offices have increased over time. Given this reality, one can expect wine excise tax to remain low in states that receive higher campaign contributions. In addition, there are theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that these tax rates are interdependent based on Tiebout competition and yardstick competition. Based on this reasoning, one can hypothesize wine excise tax rates to be spatially dependent. In this study, I test this hypothesis using state-level campaign contributions data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics and Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. and find that there is strong statistical evidence of spatial dependence between state wine excise tax rates.

The results of our multinomial logit model indicate farmer cooperatives can command a price premium as compared to store brands, but not as much as non-cooperatives. Cheese and cereal consumers also indicate a general willingness to pay for product origin and family ownership attributes, but the effects are not always compatible with farmer cooperatives.

We explore the case of wine-grape farmers in Chile where we observe a bifurcation of farmer types.Quasi-subsistence farmers produce traditional wine-grape varieties and complement their subsistence income with cash coming from wine-grape sale. On the other hand, we observe entrepreneurial farmers who produce classic varieties that have the potential to produce high-quality wines. We study this bifurcation empirically using primary data collected during the 2011-2012 growing season. We find that wealth and cultivation ability provide economically and statistically significant explanatory power, but that buyer characteristics also matter. Our results suggest that a farmer's entry into the supply chain for high-quality production is not an individual's choice. Rather it is a joint decision that cannot be fully understood without considering the objectives, incentives, and information of supplier and buyer.

One challenge in combating childhood obesity via induced shifts toward a healthier diet is that the majority of food consumed by younger children is purchased or prepared by someone else, i.e., a parent. Hence, it is critical to design initiatives and marketing efforts aimed at affecting parents' purchases of healthy foods for their children. In this study, we focus on the potential of front-of-package health labels specifically designed to signal to parents those foods that are healthy for children. We report results of a choice experiment administered to 733 parents. In the experiments, branded and unbranded yogurts marketed to children are considered with different health labels. In our analysis, we control for the child's body mass index (BMI) to assess how labels affect parents' food choices in the context of varying BMI data for the children. We also include whether parents worried about their children's eating patterns react differently to the labeling. Results from two multinomial logit models indicate that parents prefer and are more likely to purchase yogurts with a label denoting the food is a healthy choice for children. Critically, we find parents with children who are overweight or obese, and hence already in the high-risk category due to their body weight, are most affected by the labels. Overall, results indicate that health labels can be an effective signal and marketing effort to nudge parents of overweight or obese children toward healthier food purchase.

Using information from more than 9000 households collected by the World Bank and the Central Statistical Agency-Ethiopia in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014, and applying econometric estimation approaches, this study reveals that Teff is mainly produced by uneducated, male-headed rural households which have access to relatively more land and more family labor. In contrast, a higher proportion of Teff is consumed by urban households and those headed by an older, educated head. Based on the findings, this study asserts that the productivity of Teff should be enhanced by developing and disseminating high-yielding varieties as Teff consumption has been increasing in general and, secondly, the resource-poor Teff cultivators should be linked with the global value chain which may bring extra benefits to them in Ethiopia; however, the loss of domestic consumers' surplus should also be considered economically.

A group of 384 panelists in three locations in the United States evaluated the appearance, the internal quality characteristics, in three sequential rounds, for the two apple variety samples. Each panelist responded to a sensory evaluation questionnaire, and then bid on the samples in an incentive compatible second price auction. We found that panelists' bids increased with the amount of information given. Also, we found that for some attributes such as sweetness, panelists preferred levels closer to their ideal rather than objectively measured higher levels. When evaluating consumers' preference and valuation for different fresh fruit varieties, a greater explanatory power is obtained when including an indicator variable for the variety along with the set of quality attributes. The indicator variable could improve the control of inherent factors related with the varieties but cannot be observed or inferred easily. Finally, our findings add to previous studies in that flavor, when expressed as a combination of sweetness and acidity in addition to textural attributes, are important determinants of consumers' acceptance.","[Gallardo, R.

These opinions can be contrasted with factual binary questions about wine: Is it oaked? Does it contain sulfites? Is it filtered? Is the grape varietal Cabernet Sauvignon or Cabernet Franc? Syrah or Grenache? Pinot Noir or Gamay? Such factual binary issues are examined within the broader context of the various measures of factual judgment: Overall Accuracy (OA), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Predicted Positive Accuracy (PPA), and Predicted Negative Accuracy (PNA). The resulting biostatistical methodology derives from biobehavioral diagnostic research investigations. The purpose of this report is to apply this methodology to the discipline of oenology to compare wine judgments with wine facts. Using hypothetical examples, wine judges' classifications of wines as oaked or unoakedwere analyzed for their degree of accuracy. The results show that OA is a poor measure of the accuracy of binary judgments relative to Se, Sp, PPA, or PNA. The biostatistics of the problem could have wide-ranging applications in the design of future oenological research investigations, and in scientific research more broadly.","[Cicchetti, Dom] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biometry, Home Off, Box 317, North Branford, CT 06471 USA",Yale University,"Cicchetti, D (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biometry, Home Off, Box 317, North Branford, CT 06471 USA.",dom.cicchetti@yale.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

It draws upon the archives of the major French champagne houses and the extensive collection of price lists and marketing material in the scattered archives of W. & A. Gilbey, the dominant wine distributor in nineteenth-century Britain, to focus on the period from 1850 to the early 1900s. This period saw the creation of a powerful marketing template centered on a group of premium brands that endured for well over a century and influenced champagne marketing worldwide. Contemporary commentators saw a cult of famous brands, which disadvantaged consumers and merchants. Looking back at this period through the lens of a century of marketing history, we can clearly see a different picture: one of astute marketing (although that termwas not then in use) that exploited selective distribution and created the concept of vintage-dated wine (what we would today call limited-edition product lines), making the champagne houses and their agents early exponents of Jean-Noel Kapferer's twenty-first-century anti-laws of luxury marketing.","[Harding, Graham] Univ Oxford, St Cross Coll, 61 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LZ, England",University of Oxford,"Harding, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, St Cross Coll, 61 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LZ, England.",Graham.Harding@history.ox.ac.uk,"Harding, Graham/A-9341-2019",,,,,,13,2,2,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

The basic idea is that, if the relation between weather and grape quality is known for each grape type in existing growing areas, then it is possible to predict the quality of grapes that would be produced in other locations, or in the same location with a changed climate. This permits the optimization of grape type selection for a location and also provides an indication of the value that a particular planting should produce. The relation of grape quality to the weather is provided for several well-known viticultural areas, including Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rioja, and the Piedmont. An application of the method to a new vineyard area in the Czech Republic following the demise of Communism is used to demonstrate the method.","[Ashenfelter, Orley] Princeton Univ, Firestone Lib, Ind Relat Sect, Econ Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Ashenfelter, O (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Firestone Lib, Ind Relat Sect, Econ Dept, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",c6789@princeton.edu,,,,,,,14,9,10,2,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

To do so, this paper investigates the value addition relationships of different supply chain players from farm to retail level. Based on extensive literature review and deep discussions with supply chain practitioners as well as academicians, a conceptual framework is developed to assist those players in identifying the importance of adding value, defining a common definition of value addition practices, and getting motivation for superior value addition improvement. Value addition practices of five stages at the food supply chain, namely, farmer, supplier, processor, distributor and retailer, are conceptualized and formulated to tests the relationship among these stages. The study mainly focuses on the value addition of farm products in Indian scenario. The findings affirmed that the farmer's value addition is positively related to supplier's value addition, processor's value addition, and distributor's value addition. Moreover, supplier's value addition is positively related to processor's value addition, and processor's value addition is positively related to distributor's value addition. Besides, distributor's value addition is positively related to retailer's value addition.

Results of a bivariate ordered probit model suggest that less conscientious individuals, males, and individuals who have a greater trust in food manufacturers and the government to ensure the safety of food are less likely to desire GM labeling.

Empirical results from a sample of Spanish fruit and vegetable firms for the period between 2009 and 2012 reveal different adjustment processes of current, debt, and return on assets ratios between cooperatives and IOFs. We find significant differences between these firms, with slower adjustment rates for current and debt ratios in cooperatives. These findings may arise from the weakness associated with ownership structure in cooperatives, which reduces their adjustment processes compared to those of IOFs. The identification of differences in adjustment processes between cooperatives and IOFs may provide us with additional information regarding the specific management characteristics of these agri-food firms, thus identifying those firms that are most dependent on external market conditions.","[Martinez-Victoria, MCarmen] Tech Univ Cartagena, Business Econ Dept, Fac Business Adm, Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain; [Sanchez Val, Mariluz Mate] Tech Univ Cartagena, Finance & Accounting Dept, Fac Business Adm, Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain; [Arcas Lario, Narciso] Tech Univ Cartagena, Business Econ Dept, Paseo Alfonso XIII 48, Cartagena 30203, Murcia, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Martinez-Victoria, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cartagena, Business Econ Dept, Fac Business Adm, Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain.",mluz.mate@upct.es; arcas.lario@upct.es; mdc.mvictoria@gmail.com,"Mate, Mariluz/H-2131-2015","Mate, Mariluz/0000-0002-9805-6365; Martinez-Victoria, MCarmen/0000-0003-3964-2759","Catedra Cajamar de Cooperativismo Agroalimentario, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Seneca Foundation [19884/GERM/15]","Catedra Cajamar de Cooperativismo Agroalimentario, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Catedra Cajamar de Cooperativismo Agroalimentario, Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, and from Seneca Foundation.

A combination of two successive CEs are designed with focus on consumers' demand for the attributes of baby milk formula in China, where the first CE includes the full set of attributes and the second excludes consumers' self-reported nonattended attributes in the first CE. Significant discrepancies are detected for both WTPs for an individual attribute and the total WTPs (the sum of all WTPs for individual attributes in each CE), and in most cases WTPs decrease as a result of excluding the ignored attributes. Changes in WTP are mainly driven by the variation of choice task complexity. However, there is no significant difference in the influence of excluding nonattended attributes on the WTPs for the same attended attribute in different subsamples. In addition, we also find that consumers in China have significantly higher but dispersed WTP values for imported (11.6-47.0%), organic (6.9-52.5%), and probiotics (7.3-35.5%) and sugar-free (5.9-26.0%) attributes for baby milk formula.","[Quan, Shiwen] China Acad Social Sci, Inst Rural Dev, Jian Guo Men Nei Str 5, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yinchu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, MZG 10-121,Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Bao, Te] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Renmin University of China; University of Gottingen; Nanyang Technological University,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, MZG 10-121,Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",quanshiwen@163.com; zengyc@ruc.edu.cn; xyu@uni-goettingen.de; baote@ntu.edu.sg,"Bao, Te/S-2353-2019","Bao, Te/0000-0001-6397-9365; Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",MOE of Singapore [M4011676]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [RTG1666]; SUG grant of Nanyang Technological University [M4081740]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71633005],"MOE of Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); SUG grant of Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank editor Dr. Rigoberto Lopez and three anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

It is based on primary data from 400 orchid and mango producers from the major production areas in Thailand. Mixed logit model estimations show that producers with higher levels of education and awareness about environmental and social requirements are more likely to adopt GLOBALG.A.P. standards. Prior experience in high-value market channels and with public Good Agricultural Practice standards are also crucial factors that motivate producers to adopt GLOBALG.A.P. standards. However, certification costs and time needed for record keeping and training are major adoption barriers. Against this background, we propose more education and stakeholder workshops to increase the likelihood of adoption among Thai horticultural producers. The formation of regular discussion groups would allow fruitful interaction among producers and with advisors, eventually providing vital links between implementation of standards and day-to-day farm practices.

Using data from surveys of members of 60 cooperatives in Fujian province, China, this study shows that social capital is related to cooperative financing performance, interpreted as (1) members' willingness to provide equity, (2) loans from members and from banks, and (3) cooperatives providing financing services to members. Three dimensions of social capital are identified; external, relational, and cognitive. The findings indicate that Chinese cooperatives obtain bank credit more easily if they have been granted government honors and if the chairperson has government contacts (external social capital). Loyal members (relational social capital) are more likely to obtain financial services, such as guarantees for member loans. Cooperatively convinced members (cognitive social capital) are more willing to provide capital.

Furthermore, we note that individuals with stronger preferences for organic products tend to attach a global value to the certification program, whereas the valuation tends to be more restrictive among respondents that prioritize the status quo option (conventional alternative). We also observe that differences in respondents' geographic location and level of awareness of organic food production characteristics (prior to the survey) have significant impact on consumers' choices.","[Bello, Muhammad; Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",mbello@food-econ.uni-kiel.de; aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,17,6,7,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2018,34.0,2,,,,,190,203,,10.1002/agr.21506,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,GE0NP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430911700002,0

Methods to overcome this problem have largely been rejected by the research community (i.e., conjectural variations). The primary objective of our research is to introduce a new methodology for measuring imperfect competition under product differentiation in consumer goods. We develop the empirical procedures for estimating a competitive toughness model as proposed by d'Aspremont, Dos SantosFerreira, and Gerard-Varet. This approach presents a theoretically grounded procedure that measures market power in an empirically tractable framework. We estimate the proposed model on the retail market for ground coffee. Our results suggest that market power is understated in a model that imposes the restriction of Bertrand pricing. The results suggest that this could be a promising approach for use in many applications.

The tasting involved three successive experiments. First, our subjects tried to distinguish bottled waters in a sensory discrimination test. They were only slightly better than random chance at doing so. Next, they rated bottled waters and tap water on a 14-point scale used at an international water competition. Some subjects preferred the inexpensive tap water to any of the bottled waters, and there was no association or a weak negative association between a bottled water's price and its rating. Finally, our subjects tried to distinguish tap from bottled water while matching the bottled waters to expert descriptions. They were no better than random chance at doing either of those things.

We use pre-harvest forward contract bids from 1977 to 2013 in Illinois to estimate the cost of forward contracting corn and soybeans. Prior to 2007, it cost 1.55% of the October spot price or 3.74 cents/bushel on average to forward contract corn at the end of February. In 2007-2013, a period of high price volatility, the average cost increased to 3.31% or 16.40 cents/bushel. In the soybean market, before 2007 the average cost was 0.77% or 6.26 cents/bushel and thereafter increased to 1.46% or 15.62 cents/bushel. Default risk does not appear to be a determinant of forward contracting cost. However, evidence suggests that the higher cash flow risk associated with volatile market prices is likely to be the main driving cause of increasing forward contracting costs observed after 2007.

The estimated VECM shows that violations of spatial price equilibrium are corrected faster between Arkansas River-New Orleans prices than New Orleans-Middle East prices.

However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice-producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

Focusing on the Canadian wine industry, this article examines the determinants of a winery's decision to adopt Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) certification for wines. The analysis also examines whether wineries seek VQA certification for higher-priced wines or whether VQA certification leads to higher wine prices. To examine the certification decision, a probit model is applied to a detailed data set of Canadian wines sold in Ontario over the period 2007-2012. Wines from wineries that supply large volumes of wines ( more than 1,000 cases) are more likely to have VQA certification, as well as ice wines and wines from specific regions. A Hausman specification test for endogeneity suggests that VQA certification leads to higher wine prices and not the other way around.","[Ugochukwu, Albert I.] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada; [Hobbs, Jill E.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Bruneau, Joel F.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, 9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Ugochukwu, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada.",a.ugochukwu@usask.ca; jill.hobbs@usask.ca; joel.bruneau@usask.ca,,"Hobbs, Jill/0000-0003-0357-6817; Ugochukwu, Albert/0000-0001-8536-7028","Canadian Agricultural Innovation and Regulation Network; Alliance for Food and Bioproducts Innovation Scholars program, Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture","Canadian Agricultural Innovation and Regulation Network; Alliance for Food and Bioproducts Innovation Scholars program, Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture","The authors thank the Liquor Control Board of Ontario and Vintners Quality Alliance of Ontario for providing data.

The main reasons discussed in the literature are information asymmetries, which leads to adverse selection and moral hazard, as well as the absence of profit orientation due to poorly specified and diluted property rights. However, although, in reality, many cooperatives indeed perform poorly, and some are apparently able to completely avoid or at least reduce the problems that are considered prototypical for this hybrid organizational form. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics required to reduce the problems resulting from poorly specified property rights and information asymmetries and, hence, to successfully compete in the market. The data we use to identify the characteristics that separate good and bad cooperatives encompass 136 organizations in Austria, Germany, and northern Italy. Our logistic regression estimations show that older and larger cooperatives (in terms of acreage) have a significantly higher probability to be listed in at least one of two highly respected wine guides. Moreover, German cooperatives have a significantly lower probability of being listed than either Austrian or northern Italian cooperatives. The findings suggest that differences in performance can be explained by the management of cooperatives.","[Fanasch, Patrizia; Frick, Bernd] Paderborn Univ, Management Dept, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Frick, Bernd] Castle Seeburg Univ, Dept Sport Econ & Sport Mkt, Seeburgstr 8, A-5201 Seekirchen Salzburg, Austria",University of Paderborn,"Fanasch, P (通讯作者)，Paderborn Univ, Management Dept, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",patrizia.fanasch@uni-paderborn.de; bernd.frick@uni-paderborn.de,,"Fanasch, Patrizia/0000-0002-6254-8106",,,,,68,10,13,1,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

Results show the improved speed of price adjustment after the MPR in the supply chain of the beef industry, whereas a limited evidence of the increased price asymmetry is detected. The increased asymmetry is observed mostly through the long-run regime switching coefficients of threshold autoregressive and error correction models. The price asymmetry mostly disappears in both pre- and post-MPR periods when only short- and long-run price adjustment coefficients are considered.

We investigate the territorial distribution of direct sales practices (on-farm and off-farm) in Piedmont (Italy) and we assess the main determinants of these choices via probit models, separately for on-farm and off-farm sales. The explanatory variables comprise structural characteristics of the farms, type of farming, characteristics of the operators and of their products, and the proximity to urban and commercial areas. The most important factor affecting these choices is the type of farming (TF). The effect of other variables differs according to the TF. Conditional on it, other significant variables are generally farm location, organic farming and, especially for on-farm direct sales, the complementarity with agro-tourism and recreational activities. Operators' and farm characteristics are found to affect the choice of selling directly rather weakly.

Local economy benefits were perceived as the most beneficial (compared to environmental or product quality benefits) with participants' demographics influencing their perceptions of those benefits. Visual attention to the agricultural promotional campaign logo increased consumers' purchase likelihood if they perceived locally grown plants as benefiting the local economy.

One example, fair trade, relies on a diverse set of third party standards and certification organizations. Food marketing data are used to compare products launched between 1999 and 2013 in the coffee, tea, and chocolate categories. Out of 3,257 observations making a reference to fair trade, 2,745 were certified. The other items follow certain fair trade practices or support fair trade. Many products claim both fair trade and organic (congruent claim). Fairtrade Labeling Organizations - International (FLO-I) certifiers dominate, but Fair Trade USA (breaking from FLO-I in 2012) is important. A double hurdle hedonic regression model explores the relationship between claims and suggested retail price in the United States, Canada, and European Union over two periods (1999-2011 and 2012-2013). Two models are run, one aggregating non-FLO-I members and one accounting for each individual certifier. The models (first hurdle) are not able to identify factors explaining which products are certified. Results suggest (second hurdle) that after controlling for congruent claims, having a fair trade claim certified by certain third parties significantly raises the price (above an uncertified product). In particular FLO-I certification leads to a higher price in all models in both periods. Conversely, there is a range of premia for non-FLO-I certifiers, not all statistically significant. Implications for stakeholders are advanced. [EconLit citations: D40, L15, L66].

We apply this method to a sample of about 200 breweries in Germany, because beer is a differentiated product and at the same time the sector has repeatedly been suspected to show collusive behavior. Our empirical results show that a significant part of the estimated markup is due to product differentiation. This is especially true for beers produced in Bavaria. However, there are other important sources of imperfect competition. Markups are higher for large firms and increase over time. In addition, we observe increasing returns to scale and average costs above marginal costs. Hence, in the German brewing sector a high markup does not necessarily translate into a high profit margin.

The production of sliced fresh pears is a promising alternative to overcome the lack of supplying consistently a product with superior quality with added convenience, potentially able to increase domestic consumption. In this paper, we used sensory evaluation and a Vickrey experimental auction to elicit consumers' preferences and willingness to pay for sliced packed fresh pears treated with SmartFresh (1-methylcyclopropene) and subsequently with a ripening compound (RC) in the form of glyoxylic acid at different concentration levels (1%, 2%, 3%, and control). Panelists were willing to pay a price premium equivalent to $0.119/2 oz packet for the 2% RC sample, $0.055/2 oz packet for the 3% RC sample, and $0.025/2 oz packet for the 1% RC sample compared to the control sample. Results from a market segmentation analyses indicate the presence of two groups in the panelist sample. The group that liked sliced pears assigned higher importance to locally grown fruit and price, shopped at conventional retailer grocery stores, had fewer children in the household, and were younger compared to the group that disliked sliced pears.","[Ikiz, Dila] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, POB 646210, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Gallardo, R.

We address the self-selection into CF by using propensity score matching and translog stochastic frontier function to estimate our empirical model. Using farm-level data from Nepal, our findings show that CF increased the average TE levels of HYV paddy seed producers from 87% to 94% and the average TE levels of ginger producers from 89% to 97%.

In a competitive market, the effectiveness of the various elements of a firm's marketing mix depends not only on the absolute value of each element but also on the relative values of the elements with respect to the firm's position in the market. In this paper, we analyze the demand structure and market positions of a variety of seafood products in the French retail market. We used a labeled choice experiment to analyze 12 seafood species. The choice options were labeled by the names of the seafood, providing researchers the opportunity to analyze the competitive interactions among the species. Competitive clout and vulnerability measures were estimated for each species as summary measures of species competition. These measures were calculated from cross- and own-elasticities and reveal that salmon and cod have the strongest market position, while monkfish and pangasius have the weakest. In general, the demand for seafood is moderately sensitive to price (market elasticity of -1.31). Large size and low-income households, female consumers, people in the age range 35-44 years, and self-employed consumers are the most sensitive to price. Four segments were identified and described in terms of both consumer characteristics and preferences. Our results are meaningful for producers and retailers to develop marketing strategies and production plans.","[Nguyen Tien Thong; Solgaard, Hans Stubbe; Haider, Wolfgang; Roth, Eva; Ravn-Jonsen, Lars] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Sociol Environm & Business Econ, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark; [Nguyen Tien Thong] Nha Trang Univ, Fac Econ, 04 Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam",University of Southern Denmark; Nha Trang University,"Thong, NT (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Sociol Environm & Business Econ, Niels Bohrs Vej 9, DK-6700 Esbjerg, Denmark.",thongtiennguyen@gmail.com; hso@sam.sdu.dk; er@sam.sdu.dk; lrj@sam.sdu.dk,"Roth, Eva/IUM-6965-2023","Ravn-Jonsen, Lars J./0000-0003-4063-852X; Roth, Eva/0000-0002-4054-2715","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation under the MarBioShell project; European Commission under PrimeFish project-EU Horizon 2020 [635761]","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation under the MarBioShell project; European Commission under PrimeFish project-EU Horizon 2020","The research was funded partly by the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation under the MarBioShell project, and partly by European Commission under PrimeFish project-EU Horizon 2020 (Grant Agreement Number 635761).",,49,10,10,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0742-4477,1520-6297,,AGRIBUSINESS,Agribusiness,SPR,2018,34.0,2,,,,,163,189,,10.1002/agr.21504,0.0,,,27,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,GE0NP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430911700001,0

Evidence from a Compositional Time Series Approach,JOURNAL OF WINE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,alcohol consumption shares; compositional data analysis,,"Holmes and Anderson (2017a) introduce two extensive data sets on world alcohol consumption and expenditure and with them investigate, among other things, the possible convergence of national alcohol consumption patterns using wine, beer, and spirit shares. Such share data define a composition, on which conventional statistical analysis using covariances and correlations is invalid. This note reanalyses the data using techniques appropriate for a composition and introduces a statistic that can validly track the variation in national shares around the global mean through time. This variability statistic shows that such convergence of national alcohol patterns has clearly taken place over the period 1961 to 2014 and thus confirms Holmes and Anderson's findings using a valid statistical approach.

It is therefore not surprising that suppliers of those imports and U.K. wine consumers, producers, traders, distributors, and retailers are focusing on what the United Kingdom's planned withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) might mean for them. In this paper, a model of the world's wine markets is used to project those markets to 2025 without, and then with, the occurrence of Brexit. The Brexit scenarios involve adjustment not just to U.K. and EU27 (the countries remaining in the European Union) bilateral tariffs but also to assumed changes to the United Kingdom's income growth and currency. The relative importance of each of these three components of the initial shock are reported, as are impacts on bilateral wine-trade values and volumes for still and sparkling wines. The results suggest that the impact outside the United Kingdom will be minor compared with other developments in the world's wine markets. Inside the United Kingdom, however, the effect of Brexit on incomes and the British pound are likely to have nontrivial initial impacts on the domestic wine market and to be far more consequential than the direct impact of changes in bilateral tariffs.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Wine Econ Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Wittwer, Glyn] Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University; Victoria University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Wine Econ Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au; Glyn.Wittwer@vu.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,22,17,17,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

The first two are the original-score average and rank average, which are conventional methods in practice. The third is a relatively new ranking method called Shapley ranking. It is a game-theory-based ranking method, whereby judges are required not to rank order or score all the wines but only to choose a subset that they find meritorious. A simulation study is designed, wherein the data-generating scheme mimics how the real wine-tasting data are produced. We also consider two criteria in the comparison: the squared-error loss, which is a suitable measure when accurate ranking of all wines is of interest; and the percentile loss, which only considers whether the wines are correctly put in a certain subset. The main conclusion from our study is that the ranking based on score average is generally more accurate than that based on rank average. Shapley ranking, with the consideration that it puts less burden on judges in wine tasting, may outperform the other methods in certain conditions.","[Cao, Jing; Stokes, Lynne] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, 3225 Daniel Ave,POB 750332, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Cao, J (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, 3225 Daniel Ave,POB 750332, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",jcao@mail.smu.edu; slstokes@mail.smu.edu,,,,,,,6,4,4,1,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

The extent to which this has been the case in alcohol consumption has been the subject of previous studies, but those studies have been limited in scope to a specific region or group of high-income countries or to just one or two types of alcohol. The present study updates earlier findings, covers all countries of the world since 1961, and introduces two new summary indicators to capture additional dimensions of the extent of convergence in total alcohol consumption and in its mix of beverages. It also distinguishes countries according to whether their alcoholic focus was on wine, beer, or spirits in the early 1960s as well as their geographic regions and their real per-capita incomes. For recent years, we add expenditure data and compare alcohol with soft drink retail expenditure, and we show the difference it makes when unrecorded alcohol volumes are included as part of total alcohol consumption. The final section summarizes our findings and suggests that further research could provide new demand elasticity estimates and use econometrics to explain the varying extents of convergence over time, space, and beverage type.","[Holmes, Alexander J.; Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Wine Econ Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Wine Econ Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",alexander.holmes@student.adelaide.edu.au; kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",University of Adelaide's EU Centre for Global Affairs,University of Adelaide's EU Centre for Global Affairs,The authors are grateful for helpful journal reviewer comments and for financial support from the University of Adelaide's EU Centre for Global Affairs.,,21,58,61,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

To that effect, we run a Dirichlet model on Nielsen scan data to estimate brand performance measures and study purchase patterns in the sparkling wine market. We find that Prosecco wines benefit from high-consumer loyalty, and that this loyalty can be explained by both the appeal of the Prosecco appellation and its upper-tier price point.

We conducted online choice experiments with a sample of over 1,400 consumers from the U.S. to determine WTP for production and region of origin labeling accounting for simultaneous versus individual labeling. Results indicate consumers prefer dates grown in Arizona over dates not labeled for region of origin. Also, pesticide-free and GMO-free dates are preferred, with pesticide-free having a larger impact on choices. Furthermore, accounting for interactions between these two labels reveals that they can be considered subadditive in that labeling the product with both designations reduces WTP relative to pesticide-free labeling only.

Based on 2,221 Wine Spectator-rated pinot noirs from between 1984 and 2008, regression analyses demonstrate that regional reputation premiums have significantly increased with the creation of sub-AVAs and that the price-quality ratio gap between sub-AVAs and the rest of Willamette has widened.","[Gokcekus, Omer; Finnegan, Clare M.] Seton Hall Univ, Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA",Seton Hall University,"Gokcekus, O (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",Omer.Gokcekus@shu.edu; finneganclare@msn.com,,,,,,,14,5,5,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

This study employs also a comparison of dynamic with static inefficiency measures to address the importance of accounting for adjustment costs when measuring a firm's inefficiency. Dynamic and static cost inefficiencies and their decomposition into technical, allocative, and scale inefficiency are derived using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Results show that firms' low levels of dynamic cost inefficiency are mainly due to dynamic allocative inefficiency rather than technical and scale inefficiency. The 2008 financial crisis appears to hamper firms' dynamic technical performance, but has also a positive influence on the dynamic allocative and scale inefficiencies. We further show that the average static measures tend to underestimate all inefficiency components compared to dynamic counterparts.

We use this database to construct descriptive statistics concerning the evolution of Cognac exports during this period. We also construct a database of protectionist policies that affect worldwide Cognac exports. We analyze the determinants of Cognac exports and base our empirical strategy on Heckman's (1979) procedure. We estimate successively the impact of geographical, demand and policy factors on the extensive margin of trade and the intensive margin of trade. We also control for the possibility of an endogeneity bias on the probability of trade. We show that i) as with other luxury products, the elasticity of Cognac exports to distance is negative, significant, and relatively small, while the elasticity to gross domestic product (GDP) is positive, significant, and relatively large; and ii) average customs duties do not have a significant impact on the intensive margin but significantly and positively affect the probability of trade. We discuss this last result and correct the endogeneity bias using tax revenues of importing countries in percentage of GDP as an instrument.","[Bouet, Antoine; Lamani, Viola] Univ Bordeaux, Dept Econ, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Bouet, Antoine] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Emlinger, Charlotte] CEPII, 113 Rue Grenelle, F-75007 Paris, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Bouët, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Dept Econ, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.;Bouët, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.bouet@cgiar.org; charlotte.emlinger@cepii.fr; viola.lamani@u-bordeaux.fr,,"Emlinger, Charlotte/0000-0002-3593-0617",,,,,25,10,11,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1931-4361,1931-437X,,J WINE ECON,J.

They claim that a firm's organizational form, when agreed upon competitively, conditions the sense of entitlement of the involved parties. The sense of entitlement determines their feeling of grievance for the outcome of the contract and, if so, their shading efforts by partially withholding consummate performance, creating deadweight losses. We consider two main organizational forms: non-integration, where growers interact in the winemaking process and can highlight the quality of their individual contributions, and integration, where individual contributions to the process may not be explicitly acknowledged and the winemaker cannot exert quality control over the production chain. We present a formal coordination model that illustrates how cooperatives and private firms can coexist within a market. Furthermore, given the reasonable parameter constraints, it illustrates how an integrated cooperative can obtain a higher social surplus than a non-integrated private firm.","[Santos-Arteaga, Francisco J.; Schamel, Gunter] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Santos-Arteaga, FJ (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Pl 1, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",FSantosArteaga@unibz.it; guenter.schamel@unibz.it,"Schamel, Guenter/J-1735-2012; Santos Arteaga, Francisco Javier/D-6725-2019","Schamel, Guenter/0000-0003-0481-432X; Santos Arteaga, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-2385-4781",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano [WW2032],Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"We would like to thank, without implicating, an anonymous reviewer for valuable comments on an early version of this paper.

Further, a majority of plants are expenditure-elastic with the estimates of foliage plants manifesting the greatest variability. Finally, plants in the same category appear to be closer substitutes.

The results suggest that there exists an oligopolistic structure in the Chinese wine industry, and geographical region has significant impact on the market power. We also provide discussions on future directions of market structure for domestic as well as multinational firms.

These changes are forcing sugarcane producers and processors, to re-evaluate their vertical coordination and growth strategies. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between the vertical coordination strategies at the production-processing interface of the Brazilian ethanol supply chain and the technical efficiency of the mills. It utilizes data envelopment analysis and a Tobit censored model in combination with unique data on 204 mills that account for around half of Brazil's sugar and ethanol production. Results indicate that vertical integration and the location of the mill have a statistically significant impact on efficiency. The findings show that the technical efficiency is not the main driver of vertical integration implying that such decisions are primarily motivated by strategic considerations. The mills are likely to forgo gains in technical efficiency in exchange for improving their strategic position through vertical integration. These findings shed light on the underlying motivation for the observed level of vertical integration that accompanies the expansion of the Brazilian sugarcane industry.

We found that U.S. consumers would reduce their poultry demand and substitute by livestock meats when such news is reported by media negatively.

Furthermore, since the early 2000s the craft segment has realized consistent growth whereas large breweries have seen a steady decline in sales. Macro-breweries have responded by acquiring smaller breweries to capture a share of the craft market. This study implements an experimental approach to measure consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for locally produced and independently owned beer.

The purpose of this paper is to gain a more in-depth understanding of the strategies used by those farmers to manage these risks by analysing portfolio strategies in marketing methods and in production decisions. The findings show that three main categories of marketing methods can be adopted in different proportions: forward contracts, average price contracts and spot market selling. A hundred farmers are surveyed in South-West France. An empirical analysis of the determinants of their marketing methods show that risk perceptions and the farmer's level of education influence the choice to sign a preharvest contract for part of their production. In addition, agricultural diversification is negatively correlated with the choice to use forward contracts to hedge against market risk.

This study also examines the cost-push and demand-pull theories. The results indicate the presence of cointegration among the three price series for each of the eight food chains. The demand-pull factors are found to have a stronger impact along the food supply chain than the supply-push factors. The short-run causality results show bidirectional causal relations among the three prices, whereas the long-run causality findings support the assertion that consumer prices dominate the other two prices, implying an attempt by retailers to exert control over the pricing mechanisms along the Finnish food supply chain. The impulse response functions show that the agricultural product prices experience higher and more prolonged fluctuations around the long-run equilibrium than the other two prices.

Next, the relevance of gold medals as indicators of wine quality is assessed, using the average scores from Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator as surrogates for quality. By itself, knowledge that a wine is a gold medal winner appears to have little relevance, as these wines do not score significantly higher than other medal winners.

Dairy hubs promoted by East African Dairy Development project are collective farmer-owned milk bulking and/or chilling plants through which farmers get access to output markets and inputs as well as other services necessary for their dairy enterprises. The hubs act as a linkage between large processors and smallholder dairy farmers. They enable farmers to supply milk to large dairy processors who are emerging key players in the East African dairy industry. In addition to the different forms of linkages with large processors, these hubs also differ in their level of growth toward sustainability. In light of this background, this work aims to provide evidence on the effects, at farm level, of different types of linkages between smallholder dairy farmers and large processors through dairy hubs. The study uses cross-sectional survey data collected from 993 smallholder livestock keeping households living within the dairy hubs' catchment areas in Kenya and Uganda. Statistical tests on technical efficiency estimates from dairy farm enterprises were conducted in order to provide evidence of the effects of the types of processor linkages on the performance of the dairy farm enterprises. The results provide evidence of no strong influence at farm levels that can be attributed to different forms of linkages with processor that dairy hubs adopt. Moreover, though hub sustainability is directly linked to the producer organization's efficiency level, our results show that it does not sufficiently translate to more productive farmers. These findings call for concerted efforts by development agents in the dairy sector, policy makers, and even large processors to intervene in order to support improved farmperformance. As evident from the study, one direct policy tool at the disposal of these agents is extension messages. [EconLit citations D24; L25; Q12]. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We find that brand loyalty factors based on the psychology of consumers who seek value-added vegetables with health and safety characteristics have the largest effect on the WTP premium.

APC algorithms are designed to separate price appreciation with the age of the wine from overall wine-market conditions as well as to adjust for the unique value of specific vintages. In this context, the APC modeling provides a kind of Hedonic modeling, with specific controls regarding specification errors. The analysis was segmented by Chateau Lafite Rothschild, Bordeaux excluding Lafite, and Burgundy so that we could test specific events related to Chateau Lafite Rothschild. The results show price dynamics versus the ages of the wines and allow for the measurement of long-term price-appreciation potential. Environment functions versus auction dates quantify the Lafite Bubble and suggest past correlation to Chinese stock-market indices. An analysis of wine ratings versus price quantifies their nonlinear relationship.

We examine whether terroir matters in the New-World wines produced in California's Napa and Sonoma Counties by conducting a hedonic price analysis of vineyard sales over the period 1991 to 2007 to determine the relative effects on vineyard sales prices of designated appellations versus biophysical site attributes commonly associated with terroir, such as slope, aspect, elevation, and climate. Because vineyards that are sold are not necessarily representative of the universe of vineyards, we employ Heckman's two-stage econometric approach to control for possible sample-selection bias. We find that intrinsic site attributes and designated appellations influence vineyard prices, although our results are stronger and more consistent with regard to the influence of appellations.

Increased variability in both the world milk price and the world feed price during the last 7-8 years has increased the need for research on price dynamics and price forecasting. The aims of this paper are to explore the dynamics embedded in and between the world milk and feed prices, and to produce reliable forecasts for both prices. We collected the world milk price and the world feed price series from 2002 to 2015 from the International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN).

We develop a new cross-sectional identification approach, motivated by the insight that investors may differ in their preferred habitats within a broad asset class. We apply the method to the question of whether foreign capital is responsible for residential real estate price movements in global cities such as London and New York, especially during crises. Using large data sets of housing transactions, we find that foreign risk strongly affects London house prices. The effects are long-lasting, and are associated with both safe-haven effects and immigration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To study the impact of child care subsidies on employment, this study used detailed data from a survey of low-income parents in Minnesota, linked with administrative data on subsidy receipt, to estimate endogenous switching models of subsidy receipt and parent work status. Parental preferences about the child development-related characteristics of child care settings were the basis for an instrumental variable used to predict subsidy receipt. Receiving a subsidy significantly increased the probability of employment and especially of full-time employment. The findings suggest that expansion of the child care subsidy program could lead to increased employment among low-income parents with young children.","[Davis, Elizabeth E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 316B Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Carlin, Caroline] Univ Minnesota, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 381 Mayo, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Krafft, Caroline] St Catherine Univ, Dept Econ, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Forry, Nicole D.] Child Trends, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Saint Catherine University,"Davis, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 316B Ruttan Hall,1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",edavis@umn.edu; ccarlin@umn.edu; cgkrafft@stkate.edu; nforry@childtrends.org,"Krafft, Caroline/JWP-2516-2024","Krafft, Caroline/0000-0001-6906-9418; Carlin, Caroline/0000-0003-0813-3433","Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families, US Department of Health and Human Services [90YE098, 90YE0132]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multistate Project [NE-1049]; Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Project [MIN-14-081]","Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families, US Department of Health and Human Services; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Multistate Project; Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Project","Funding for this research was provided through Grants #90YE098 and #90YE0132 from the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families, US Department of Health and Human Services.

We jointly model the intraday CoVaR dynamics using an extended MV-CAViaR model. The results show the presence of asymmetric spillovers under different market states, different trading rules, and different confidence levels. Specifically, there exist significant downside spillovers and insignificant upside spillovers. Moreover, the futures (stock) market becomes dominant in risk transmission during bearish (bullish) market periods. Furthermore, high margin requirements would weaken the spillover effects of the futures market, but it would also strengthen the spillover effects of the stock market.","[Jian, Zhihong; Wu, Shuai; Zhu, Zhican] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Jian, ZH (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhihong.jian@hust.edu.cn; d201577873@hust.edu.cn; d201677916@hust.edu.cn,,"Jian, Zhihong/0000-0003-4327-7301",Planning Research Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [17YJA790033],Planning Research Project of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China,We are grateful to the editors and two anonymous referees for their insightful comments and helpful suggestions.

We show that female work participation increased and participation in domestic duties declined in regions that were more exposed to input tariff reductions. The effects of output tariff reductions were much less pronounced, and we find little impacts on men. Among the potential channels, we find that reductions in input tariffs led to a relative expansion of more female-intensive sectors as well as a decrease in sectoral gender segregation, especially among the low skilled. Liberalization also led to delayed marriage among both sexes and reduced fertility among less educated women.","[Kis-Katos, Krisztina] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, Gottingen, Germany; [Pieters, Janneke; Sparrow, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Sparrow, Robert] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sparrow, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kis-Katos, Krisztina; Pieters, Janneke; Sparrow, Robert] IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Gottingen; Wageningen University & Research; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Australian National University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kis-Katos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, Gottingen, Germany.;Kis-Katos, K (通讯作者)，IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany.",krisztina.kis-katos@uni-goettingen.de,"Kis-Katos, Krisztina/ABC-3624-2021","Sparrow, Robert/0000-0001-8613-0495",Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) initiative,Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women (GrOW) initiative,"We thank Arjun S.

The reduction of the US. statutory tax rate has significantly improved domestic investment incentives as measured by marginal and average effective tax rates, assuming an average use of debt and equity. In addition, the partial adoption of a participation exemption system in some cases can allow US companies now to compete globally on equal tax terms with foreign-headquartered companies. However, a new US. global minimum tax imposes current taxation on certain foreign income previously eligible for deferral and, as a result, may disfavor US. ownership of high-return foreign assets relative to foreign-headquartered companies. Average effective tax rates are also reduced by a new domestic incentive for undertaking high-return investments in the United States. Even so, US. research incentives continue to lag behind those available in many other major countries, taking into account special deductions, tax credits, and patent box regimes.","[Lyon, Andrew B.; McBride, William A.] PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Lyon, AB (通讯作者)，PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",drew.lyon@pwc.com; william.a.mcbride@pwc.com,,,,,,,37,3,3,1,17,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We use a sample of Spanish SMEs from the period of 1998 to 2012. The results support the existence of a target cash holding level to which small firms attempt to converge. Additionally, consistent with the precautionary motive for cash holdings, the results show that SMEs with greater growth opportunities adjust more quickly to their target cash holding level to preserve their financial flexibility and to be able to take advantage of profitable investment opportunities when they arise. Moreover, for SMEs in financial difficulties, the adjustment speed of cash is higher to avoid financial distress costs. Finally, we observe a faster speed of adjustment for cash holding in the crisis period for all firms, as a possible response to the credit restrictions faced by SMEs.","[Martinez-Sola, Cristina] Univ Alicante, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance & Accounting, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Garcia-Teruel, Pedro J.; Martinez-Solano, Pedro] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Murcia,"García-Teruel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Management & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",mcristina.martinez@ua.es; pjteruel@um.es; pmsolano@um.es,"Martinez Sola, Maria Cristina/F-3416-2016; Martinez-Solano, Pedro/M-3931-2014; GARCIA-TERUEL, PEDRO J/F-3501-2016","Martinez Sola, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-6476-6465; Martinez-Solano, Pedro/0000-0002-0509-5251; GARCIA-TERUEL, PEDRO J/0000-0001-7399-0111",Research Agency of the Spanish government [ECO2013-47486-P]; Fundacion CajaMurcia,Research Agency of the Spanish government; Fundacion CajaMurcia,This research is part of project ECO2013-47486-P financed by the Research Agency of the Spanish government.

The mediating role of customer satisfaction is also examined. Some of our findings are consistent with the literature, related to both LCCs and full service industries, to confirm that customer expectations directly affect satisfaction. However, different from the literature related to full service industry, our results conclude no significant influences of perceived value and service quality on customer satisfaction and purchase intention, inferring that budget air's passengers purchasing is not due to its good service quality or perceived value, but because their expectations are met. Our findings also suggest that customer satisfaction can fully mediate the positive relationship between customer expectation and purchase intention. Purchase intention of air passengers could thus be explained through the pathway in which customer satisfaction plays the role of a mediating variable in the relationship between customer expectation and purchase intention. This study not only enriches the existing literature, but also provides a valuable assistance and guidance to LCCs for their strategic marketing plans and business improvement.","[Moslehpour, Massoud] Asia Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Asia Univ, Dept Finance & Big Data, Res Ctr, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Hang Seng Management Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yi Hsin] Asia Univ, Dept Leisure & Recreat Management, Taichung, Taiwan; [Thi Le Huyen Nguyen] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Thi Le Huyen Nguyen] Univ Finance & Accountancy, Dept Business Adm, Quang Ngai, Vietnam",Asia University Taiwan; Asia University Taiwan; Hang Seng University of Hong Kong; Lingnan University; Asia University Taiwan; Yuan Ze University,"Wong, WK (通讯作者)，Asia Univ, Dept Finance & Big Data, Res Ctr, Taichung, Taiwan.;Wong, WK (通讯作者)，Hang Seng Management Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Wong, WK (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wong@asia.edu.tw,"Moslehpour, Massoud/AAS-9807-2021; Wong, Wing-Keung/JCN-7787-2023; Wong, Wing-Keung/AAI-9296-2020","Moslehpour, Massoud/0000-0001-8808-2407; Wong, Wing-Keung/0000-0001-6755-572X; Nguyen, Thi Le Huyen/0000-0003-4576-6686","Asia University; Hang Seng Management College; Lingnan University; Yuan Ze University; University of Finance and Accountancy; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600951, 2017M610058]; Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of Ministry of Education [15YJA910004]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY15A010006]; World Track Investment Ltd; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Institute for Scientific and Engineering Computing, National Tsing Hua University; University of Sydney Business School; Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam; Complutense University of Madrid; Hang Seng Management College, Lingnan University; Natural Science Foundation of China [11626130, 11601227]; Australian Research Council; Natural Science Council, Taiwan; Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong","Asia University; Hang Seng Management College; Lingnan University; Yuan Ze University; University of Finance and Accountancy; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of Ministry of Education; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); World Track Investment Ltd; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Institute for Scientific and Engineering Computing, National Tsing Hua University; University of Sydney Business School; Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam; Complutense University of Madrid; Hang Seng Management College, Lingnan University; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Natural Science Council, Taiwan; Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","The authors are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief, Marco Vivarelli, and anonymous reviewers for substantive comments that have significantly improved this manuscript.

Economic theory shows that experience rating of insurers results in state dependence of driving behavior under moral hazard. The empirical analysis is performed using a longitudinal data set from a Canadian automobile insurer. We employ dynamic nonlinear panel data models to distinguish the structural and spurious state dependence, and thus moral hazard and selection on unobservables. As a measure of the riskiness of driving, we consider the frequency, the number, as well as the cost of claims for the policyholder. We find that the state dependence in claim cost reflects both structural and spurious relationships, supporting the moral hazard hypothesis. However, the state dependence in claim occurrence is solely due to unobserved heterogeneity.","[Shi, Peng] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zhang, Wei] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Boucher, Jean-Philippe] Univ Quebec, Dept Math, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Northern Illinois University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Shi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",pshi@bus.wisc.edu; wzhang1@niu.edu; boucher.jean-philippe@uqam.ca,,"Shi, Peng/0000-0003-2789-3235",Center of Actuarial Excellence (CAE) Research Grant from the Society of Actuaries; Fall Research Competition from the University of Wisconsin-Madison,Center of Actuarial Excellence (CAE) Research Grant from the Society of Actuaries; Fall Research Competition from the University of Wisconsin-Madison,We thank Editor Keith Crocker and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

By consequence, the deficit countries that attracted lots of foreign capital experienced large run-ups in house prices, whereas most surplus countries that exported capital exhibited flat or slow house price growth. We first use new house price data and a novel instrumental variable design to show the causal relationship between housing prices and capital inflows, particularly through debt bonanzas. We then argue that international capital flows affect the fiscal policy preferences of both voters and political parties by way of their impact on housing prices. Where capital inflows are large and housing prices are rising, we expect voters to respond by demanding both lower taxes and less publicly-provided social insurance because rising house prices allow homeowners to self-insure against income loss. In contrast, declining house prices produce greater demands for social insurance, particularly among those most exposed to housing market risk. We present evidence from two cross-national surveys that supports these claims, as well as a before and after analysis of the housing crash in Eastern Europe. We also show that the connection between house prices and social policy also manifests itself in government spending outcomes, mediated by partisan control.","[Ansell, Ben W.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Ansell, Ben W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Broz, J.

Until recently, the rating process was not public. Even still, the factors or precise methodologies used by the agencies remain uncertain and analyst judgment remains important. We argue that, given uncertainty over the future paths of countries, the quality of the central bank governance serves as a useful heuristic for a stable and favorable country trajectory. In particular, the central bank's independence signals that the government is committed to general macroeconomic stability, including debt repayment. Additionally, central bank transparency clarifies who is the principal of the bank and provides information about how the central bank understands the economy and monetary policy. Finally, tensions between the central bank and the government, as reflected by irregular turnover of central bank governors, raise doubts about countries' future prospects. Empirically, we use a variety of models, including mediation analysis, to ensure that the effect we identify stems from the central bank governance itself, as a heuristic for the future paths of countries, and not the central bank's direct contribution to the macroeconomy, as reflected in the available data.","[Bodea, Cristina] Michigan State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 316 S Kedzie Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hicks, Raymond] Columbia Univ, Hist Lab, New York, NY USA",Michigan State University; Columbia University,"Bodea, C (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 316 S Kedzie Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bodeaana@msu.edu,,"Hicks, Raymond/0000-0002-6830-6810",,,,,71,26,28,0,8,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

In line with predictions from theory, this paper finds that, on average, lower dependency rates and greater longevity are associated with higher domestic saving rates. However, these correlations are statistically robust only in Asia. In particular, Latin America, which is a region that has undergone a remarkably similar saving friendly demographic transition since the 1970s, did not experience the same boost in saving rates as Asia. The paper highlights that the potential dividends arising from a favorable demographic transition are not automatically accrued. This is a sobering message at a time when the demographic tide is shifting in the world.","[Cavallo, Eduardo; Sanchez, Gabriel] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Valenzuela, Patricio] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Inter-American Development Bank; Universidad de Chile,"Cavallo, E (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",cavalloe@iadb.org,"Valenzuela, Patricio/F-8264-2016","Valenzuela, Patricio/0000-0001-8171-9751",,,,,37,3,3,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The results from second generation panel unit-root and cointegration tests that account for cross-sectional dependence as well as estimates of long-run saving-retention rate provide some evidence of market integration in ASEAN. The analysis of short-run dynamics suggests that capital mobility in ASEAN during 1980-2014 appears similar to that in OECD countries during 1970-1999. More importantly, across different panel estimators and subgroups of membership, there is considerable heterogeneity among the member countries. The saving investment association is very weak, thereby implying very high capital mobility, in more developed members such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei; the association is very strong, implying very low capital mobility, for much less developed members such as Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia. The results call for renewed effort to develop capital markets in less developed nations and integrate them with the rest of the membership in ASEAN.

This article outlines changing attitudes in project management, their relationship to decision making, and the role of the ICT worker. Large enterprises have traditionally relied on plan driven project management that presents a clear view of how to engineer and design a product for market. In this view, engineering is building the thing right and design is building the right thing. Plan-driven models succeed or fail on a top-down ability to define what right means in either context. In today's market, speed is everything, to the point that many see plan-driven project management failing to keep up with the pace. Other approaches, such as the agile approach, are gaining momentum but focus mostly on reducing time to market while relying on user feedback to define what right means. Who then is best suited to know what right means? Executives at the head of corporate hierarchies, or the people who interact with technology as users? The ICT skills needed to address this question will require a balance between speed and judgment. Participatory governance studies can inform ways to increase speed through devolved decision making, and design ethnography can provide ways that devolved decision makers can cultivate good judgment about their users. We outline this theory in practice with three case studies: delivering educational programs for app development, attempting to broaden civic engagement with natural language processing algorithms, and facilitating Indigenous clean energy projects with design thinking practices.","[Deley, Trevor] Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mindel, Marcellus] IBM Canada, IBM Adv Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; International Business Machines (IBM),"Deley, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,15,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Evidence from the 1994 Swedish pension reform,JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING,,,English,Article,,,,,,"Education, Occupation; Pension; Reform; Retirement",RETIREMENT; EMPLOYMENT; INCREASE,"This paper investigates whether the Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) scheme prolongs working life. The evidence from the 1994 Swedish pension reform shows a gender and socio-economic gradient in the labor supply responses to phasing in NDC. While the reform exerted a large and significant positive effect on the average retirement age among highly educated and skilled, it had little or negative effect on those with low level of human capital. And the overall effect is more profound among older men, compared to older women. These findings imply that the aggregate impact of NDC may only be positive if the average level of older workers' education and skills is high, whereas it may be moderate (or even adverse) if the majority of the older workers are less educated and engage in low-skill jobs.

Three simple interest rate rules (strict Inflation Targeting, standard Taylor rule, and a modified Taylor rule) are studied. The message conveyed from this study can be viewed as twofold. First, conditional on the domestic productivity shock, a standard Taylor rule is welfare enhancing. Conditional on the foreign income shock, however, welfare losses is minimized under the strict inflation targeting rule. Second, the modified Taylor rules that respond to unemployment rate rather than output is second-best for both domestic technology and foreign income shocks. Therefore, it can be argued that stabilizing unemployment rate rather than output could be the better if policy-maker is uncertain about the types of shocks.","[Rhee, Hyuk Jae] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Song, Jeongseok] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",University of Windsor; Chung Ang University,"Song, J (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",jayrhee@uwindsor.ca; jssong@cau.ac.kr,,"Song, Jeongseok/0000-0003-4814-8904",,,,,27,1,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We employ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to rank the contribution and then investigate the structural breakpoints using the Bai and Perron (2003) test. Our empirical results reveal that oil contributes the highest risk to the energy industry and the lowest risk to the Consumer Staples industry. We also find notable discrepancies between industries with regard to number of breakpoints and the break date. In particular, the rankings of the financial, materials, and utilities industries fluctuate dramatically across different sub-samples. In addition, the crude oil risk contribution was commonly larger across all these industries during the 2008 crisis period.

Production of the consumption good requires drawing from oil reserves at a fixed rate. Investment necessary to replenish oil reserves is costly and irreversible. We solve for the optimal consumption, production and oil reserves policy for a representative agent. We analyze the equilibrium price of oil, as well as the term structure of oil futures prices. Because investment in oil reserves is irreversible and costly, the optimal investment in new oil reserves is periodic and lumpy. Investment occurs when the crude oil is relatively scarce in the economy. This generates an equilibrium oil price process that has distinct behavior across two regions (characterized by the abundance/scarcity of oil). We undertake three empirical tests suggested by our model. First, we estimate key parameters using SMM to match moments of oil price futures as well as other macroeconomic properties of the data. Second, we estimate an affine regime switching model of the oil price, which captures the main features of our equilibrium model and preserves the tractability of reduced-form models. Lastly, we compare the risk premium in short-maturity oil futures implied by our model to the data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The panel data setting allows us to control for both unobserved and observed heterogeneity of PA firms, reaching several interesting and robust findings. Firstly, it finds that the Italian PA firms are scale inefficient as they generally operate in either an increasing or decreasing returns to scale landscape. This result is reinforced by the fact that the smaller firms (10-49 employees) are the most technically efficient firm size class. Secondly, this research proves that the efficiency score is on average 66%, demonstrating that PA firms' output could be substantially increased without the use of new inputs. Thirdly, it confirms that the quality matters and competences increase the efficiency in the sector. Finally, the environmental factors (especially the quality of institutions) have a strong impact on technical efficiency of PA firms, supporting that regional differences also exist in this sector.","[Castiglione, Concetta] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Infante, Davide] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Zieba, Marta] Univ Limerick, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland",University of Bologna; University of Calabria; University of Limerick,"Infante, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",concetta.castiglione@unibo.it; davide.infante@unical.it; marta.zieba@ul.ie,"Castiglione, Concetta/HKE-0235-2023; Zieba, Marta/A-8283-2018; Castiglione, Concetta/N-1037-2015; Zieba, Marta/JAZ-0878-2023","Zieba, Marta/0000-0002-9116-2413; Castiglione, Concetta/0000-0002-9397-110X; Infante, Davide/0000-0001-8520-7008",,,,,66,22,23,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The goal is to provide a collection of reflections offering a wealth of lessons and information regarding the capacity of regional governmental agencies and other actors involved in the innovation system to implement a mission-oriented research and development support program and regarding the institutional and cultural conditions that can facilitate its practical application. In the first section, I briefly review the fundamentals of S3s. In the second section, I propose a framework for the identification of mission-oriented policies and I explain how S3 fits into this category. The following section shows how this policy represents a break with the policies that have long dominated the regional policy landscape. The fourth section describes the designing of this policy whose objective is to make strategic choices and decentralization of information and initiatives compatible.

In this work, a constrained choice modeling approach with sampling of alternatives is applied to analyze an individual's location choice for discretionary activities. The issue of large choice sets is tackled through two constraining methods: (i) adequacy of destination, in which only locations which are suited to a certain type of activity are selected and (ii) use of a delimitation rule depending on the type of trip chain to which the discretionary activity belongs. A mixed logit model with sampling of alternatives is specified to estimate individuals' location choice for different types of discretionary activities. The estimation results show sampling alternatives using an individual's constrained choice set based on both adequacy destination and detour provides significantly better prediction accuracy compared to that using only adequacy of destination. We conducted several experiments with respect to constraining methods, number of sampled alternatives and bias-correcting methods for sampling of alternatives in a mixed logit model. The results show that the Naive method for sampling of alternatives in a mixed logit model provides better goodness-of-fit than estimation with correction terms.","[Mariante, Gabriel Leite] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Oude Markt 13, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Ma, Tai-Yu; Van Acker, Veronique] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, Dept Urban Dev & Mobil, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",KU Leuven,"Ma, TY (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, Dept Urban Dev & Mobil, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",tai-yu.ma@liser.lu,"VAN ACKER, Veronique/ABD-5249-2021; Van Acker, Veronique/IVH-1307-2023","VAN ACKER, Veronique/0000-0001-9343-1632; Ma, Tai-yu/0000-0001-6900-098X",Luxembourg National Research Funds under the CONNECTING project (Consequential Life Cycle Assessment of multi-modal mobility policies the case of Luxembourg) [C14/SR/8330766]; Ministry of Higher Education of Luxembourg,Luxembourg National Research Funds under the CONNECTING project (Consequential Life Cycle Assessment of multi-modal mobility policies the case of Luxembourg); Ministry of Higher Education of Luxembourg,"This work was supported by the Luxembourg National Research Funds (C14/SR/8330766), under the CONNECTING project (Consequential Life Cycle Assessment of multi-modal mobility policies the case of Luxembourg).

As measures of leadership quality we use trustworthiness of the chief as measured in a trust game. As measures of norms of civil conduct we use within-village altruism, trust and trustworthiness as measured in dictator and trust games.

We check sources of performance for Israeli corporate and government bond funds, which together account for above 70% of the Israeli mutual fund market, using a unique monthly database of approximately 10-years. Our results reveal that active management is far more important than policy for corporate bond fund returns, which is mainly attributable to managers' security selection skills. The reverse is true for government bond funds and strategic long term policies account for a larger part of excess market return variability. Furthermore, if we take into account management fees, government bond funds lose from active management. The greater heterogeneity of investments open to corporate bond funds is a possible explanation for the difference in results. Copyright (C) 2018, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

Firms with female directors tend to invest more in innovation and obtain more patents and citations for given R&D expenditures. An increase of 10 percentage points in the tenure-weighted fraction of female directors is associated with approximately 6% more patents and 7% more citations. Investigating the underlying mechanisms, the positive association between female board representation and corporate innovation is stronger when product market competition is lower and when managers are more entrenched, consistent with increased monitoring by female directors improving managers' incentives to innovate.

Here, we focus on how implementation of evidence-based practices in human service organizations (e.g., schools, hospitals) is affected by intraorganizational network dynamics. In particular, we hypothesize intraorganizational behavioral divergence and network polarization are likely to occur when actors strongly identify with their organizations. Using agent-based models, we find that when organizational identification is high, external change agents who attempt to direct organizations by introducing policy aligned messages (e.g., professional development emphasizing specific teaching practices) may unintentionally contribute to divergence in practice and polarization in networks, inhibiting full implementation of the desired practices as well as reducing organizational capacity to absorb new practices. Thus, the external change agent should consider the interaction between the type of message and the intraorganizational network dynamics driven by organizational identification.","[Frank, Kenneth A.] Michigan State Univ, Sociometr, Room 462,Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Xu, Ran] Virginia Tech, Northern Virginia Ctr, Room 433,7054 Haycock Rd, Falls Church, VA 22043 USA; [Penuel, William R.] Univ Colorado, Learning Sci & Dev, Sch Educ, Room 320-E,UCB 249, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Michigan State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Frank, KA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Sociometr, Room 462,Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kenfrank@msu.edu; ranxu@vt.edu; william.penuel@colorado.edu,"xu, ran/JGM-5566-2023","frank, kenneth/0000-0002-6116-5509",,,,,107,14,17,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The Family Options Study randomly assigned 2,282 families recruited in homeless shelters across 12 sites to priority access to one of three active interventions or to usual care in their communities. The interventions were long-term rent subsidies, short-term rent subsidies, and transitional housing in supervised programs with intensive psychosocial services. In two waves of follow-up data collected 20 and 37 months later, priority access to long-term rent subsidies reduced homelessness and food insecurity and improved other aspects of adult and child well-being relative to usual care, at a cost 9 percent higher. The other interventions had little effect. The study provides support for the view that homelessness for most families is an economic problem that long-term rent subsidies resolve and does not support the view that families must address psychosocial problems to succeed in housing. It has implications for focusing government resources on this important social problem.","[Gubits, Daniel; Wood, Michelle; Dastrup, Samuel R.] Abt Associates Inc, 6130 Execut Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; [Shinn, Marybeth] Vanderbilt Univ, Human & Org Dev, Peabody Coll 90,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Brown, Scott R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Human & Org Dev, Peabody Coll 90,230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Bell, Stephen H.] Westat Corp, Evaluat Res, 1600 Res Blvd, Rockville, MD 20850 USA",ABT Associates; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Westat,"Gubits, D (通讯作者)，Abt Associates Inc, 6130 Execut Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852 USA.",daniel_gubits@abtassoc.com; beth.shinn@vanderbilt.edu; michelle_wood@abtassoc.com; scott.r.brown@vanderbilt.edu; samuel_dastrup@abtassoc.com; stephen-bell@westat.com,,"Shinn, Marybeth/0000-0002-6681-8273","U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [C-CHI-00943, DU206SF-13-T-00005]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development [5R01HD066082]",U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This paper is based on a study that was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (contracts C-CHI-00943 [Task Orders 1 and 3] and DU206SF-13-T-00005) and which received additional funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (grant 5R01HD066082).

To assess the research hypotheses, a multi-variable regression was utilized. The research findings revealed a negative relationship between HHI and the ratio of entrance obstacles on the one hand and ETR on the other hand. Thus, the higher the power of competition in a company was, the more the tax avoidance was found. Also, a significant association was observed between HHI and the adjusted non-taxable income.

Early stages of new international conservation and development programs, often involving pilot projects designed to test intervention concepts at village level, are characterized by large amounts of resources and attention, along with high expectations of success. However, evidence shows that these early expectations are rarely fulfilled. Despite this repeated pattern and growing engagement with expectations in critical conservation and development literature, little is known about the dynamics of expectations in conservation and development pilot projects. We address this knowledge gap first by exploring concepts from the sociology of expectations. We then unpack expectations in a case study of REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, using extensive qualitative data reflecting the perspectives and experiences of a wide range of actors involved. Our study finds that expectations play a performative role, mobilizing actors and resources, despite uncertainty identified among policy-makers and practitioners. We also find that once raised, expectations are dynamic and continually mediated by actors and social contexts, which conflicts with attempts to 'manage' them. We argue therefore that a trade-off exists between fully piloting new initiatives and raising expectations. We also argue that failure to address this trade-off has implications beyond pilot project objectives and timelines, which are experienced most acutely by village communities. We argue for more critical engagement with expectations and the embedding of accountability for expectations in conservation and development practice. Our findings also challenge the discourse of 'needing' to pilot, which prioritizes awareness, impact and innovation without fully considering the potential negative impact of unfulfilled expectations.

Not surprisingly, its latest global development priorities, announced through its Sustainable Development Goals agenda in 2015, emphasize addressing the slum challenge in developing countries as a major goal. Our study focuses on gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature and extent of such slum challenge faced by Nairobi. Specifically, using data from a recent (2012-13) statistically representative survey, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the rental housing market conditions faced by households living in slum versus formal areas of Nairobi. Our analysis findings establish relevant benchmarking for key policy relevant measures against which to evaluate the efficacy of new policy initiatives. Taken together, our findings show that the households in Nairobi's slum areas, compared to their counterparts in formal areas, are currently facing a substantial double jeopardy. On one hand, they face significant disparity gaps - about 24 percentage points in less coverage - across a myriad of housing and living condition indicators. For some basic services like water, toilet and public sewage disposal, the gaps are as high as 40-50 percentage points. On the other hand, we were able to quantify for the first time the extent of rent premium - about 16 percent - that Nairobi's slum tenants are paying relative to their formal area counterparts, after adjusting for housing quality conditions. While our study's primary goal was on demonstrating the presence and the extent of the double jeopardy, it also sheds important insights from normative policy perspectives. A novel insight here is that although formal tenure agreements are rare in Nairobi's slums, the tenants do pay a rent premium of about 18 percent if they possess such agreements.

An additional dollar of cash is more valuable for firms with less procyclical expansion opportunities. This valuation effect is strongest for low leverage and high R&D firms, but is independent of their financial status. Corporate cash holdings provide the flexibility to invest for firms that have expansion opportunities during crisis times with business cycle downturns and supply-side financial constraints.

Specifically, using the CAMELS rating system as a general framework for supervision, we study how charter value relates to risk and supervision by means of classification and regression tree analysis. The sample covers the period 2005-2016 and consists of listed banks in countries that were members of the Eurozone when it came into existence, along with Greece. To evaluate the crisis consequences, we also separately analyze four subperiods and countries that required financial aid from third parties and those that did not so, along with large and small banks. Our results reflect the complexity of the relations between charter value, supervision, and risk. Indeed, supervision and charter value seem aligned regarding only some types of risk.

Income-based charges such as resource rent taxes have been advocated on the theory that royalties and other output-based charges create inefficiency by distorting production decisions. Using a principal-agent approach to resource contracts, separating asset ownership from asset use, we demonstrate that royalties can be efficient under conditions of certainty and also when there is uncertainty and asymmetric information. Royalties serve a key pricing purpose, signaling the marginal impact of extraction on the residual value of reserves and surrounding land or sea.","[Conrad, Robert F.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Conrad, Robert F.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Hool, Bryce] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Comp Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Duke University; Duke University; Singapore Management University; University of Virginia; University of Virginia,"Conrad, RF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Conrad, RF (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,7,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,AUG,2018,94.0,3,,,,,340,353,,10.3368/le.94.3.340,0.0,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GN4CO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438962500003,0

Recent research on adaptation in developing and developed countries argues that the measures of such fairness cannot be captured by standard metrics of vulnerability and should be situated in the milieu of people's daily lives and temporalities. Yet there is little empirical evidence to support this theoretical argument. This paper describes a method, and presents findings from research that aimed to understand and classify the lived values of four marginal rural communities at risk of sea-level rise in Australia to inform adaptation planning and implementation. Our research finds that there are at least five types of primary residents and second homeowners attached to these four low-lying coastal communities. Some of these residents are more likely to be amenable to relocation if their needs for affordable living and belonging are met. For others, there may be little that can be done to compensate for the loss of place attachment, and implementing a measured approach that provides them time to adapt to the idea of change and form connections to new places is the best that could be achieved. We discuss the implications of place-specific and people centric values for achieving fair adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Retailers are figures from whom farmers purchase seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals. The article traces the rise of village-level retailers in western Maharashtra, India, since the 1990s, and finds that Maratha (a dominant landholding cultivator caste) households have ventured into retailing. Further, farmers depend on retailers for credit, technical knowledge, and for the sale of their harvest. By analysing the pressures and risks of petty retail, visible in interactions with farmers, the article argues that even as retailing provides avenues for upward mobility to petty agricultural commodity producers, the trade is too volatile for the gains to sustain. Thus, the entry of Marathas into petty retail is akin to an attempt at class differentiation but without consolidation.","[Aga, Aniket] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Aga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",aniket.aga.2016@gmail.com,,,"Wenner-Gren Foundation [8726]; MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, Yale University; South Asian Studies Council, Yale University; Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University; National Science Foundation [1324382]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1324382] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Wenner-Gren Foundation; MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, Yale University; South Asian Studies Council, Yale University; Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Wenner-Gren Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 8726; MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, Yale University; South Asian Studies Council, Yale University; Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1324382",,60,24,26,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Our model endogenizes the packaging design as an additional determinant for the overall amount of waste jointly with consumers' sorting effort and producers' output decisions. The model shows that the policies that yield the first-best allocation may not find public support. Furthermore, if the set of available policy instruments is limited, production and consumption of the good is likely to settle on a sub-optimal level even though the optimal allocation may be achievable. Finally, the model demonstrates that a landfill tax may actually increase landfill waste in the presence of tradable credits for recycling activities.

Second, our results show that when financing is omitted in a bargaining model, the total gain from trade is incorrectly defined, and price is thus miscalculated.

His works in finance, often of great simplicity, changed the dominant paradigm. While there are few arbitrage opportunities in financial markets, they do exist and may be persistent. Rational investors do not always have the last word and prices often tend to over- or under-react to information. It is always particularly difficult to beat the market, even for knowledgeable practitioners, but asset prices do not fully capture the fundamentals and speculative bubbles are common.

We find that information contained in option trades prior to FOMC rate change announcements, measured as implied volatility spread, predicts bank stock returns to a greater degree than does volatility spread prior to non-meeting days. We examine U.S. banks due to their interest rate sensitivity; however, we also show that return predictability around rate changes is reliably stronger in all firms, across all industries that are more interest rate sensitive. We find that return predictability is primarily driven by surprise changes in interest rates that occur during meetings with high degrees of information asymmetry. Finally, we document that volatility spread impounds information about FOMC meetings before that information is reflected in stock prices; this effect is significantly greater during surprise events, suggesting that the options market is an important source of informed trading.

This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the farmer's decision environment in this situation and uses a numerical analysis to illustrate both the potential for a range of levels of compensation payments to achieve this dual incentivising, and how this range is affected by changes in the parameter values of the farmer's decision environment. The findings of the paper are used to suggest a range of policy implications in relation to compensation payments in the UK.","[Fraser, Rob] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Fraser, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",r.w.fraser@kent.ac.uk,,"Fraser, Robert/0000-0003-3444-581X",,,,,12,10,11,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using a rich dataset providing various information about all deputies from 1959 to 2012, the results indicate that the typical ghost deputy is an old man with a low level of schooling, member of a large party which does not support the government and who is elected in jurisdiction with a low level of political competition. However, personal characteristics are less and less correlated with performance over the years. Finally, ghost deputies face more difficulties to achieve reelection, but are penalized only at the first round, voters exclusively considering national factors at the second round.","[Gavoille, Nicolas] Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Strelnieku Iela 4a, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia; [Gavoille, Nicolas] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Sci Econ, Condorcet Ctr Polit Econ, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35000 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Gavoille, N (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Strelnieku Iela 4a, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia.",nicolas.gavoille@sseriga.edu,,"Gavoille, Nicolas/0000-0003-0777-4554",,,,,58,11,11,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The empirical results indicate a robust association between information arrival and subsequent mean forecast errors (the average difference between forecast and realization). Consistent with the overreaction hypothesis, more positive information is followed by higher mean forecast errors. The association is documented for multiple metrics of past information flows: growth performance, a novel metric of press sentiment, and lagged forecast errors.

This study constructs a tail risk network to present overall systemic risk of Chinese financial institutions, given the macroeconomic and market externalities. Employing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method of high-dimensional models, our results show that firm's idiosyncratic risk can be affected by its connectedness with other institutions. The risk spillover effect from other companies is the main driving factor of firm-specific risk, comparing with macroeconomic state, firm characteristics and historical price movement. The number of connections between institutions significantly increases during June 2014 to June 2016. Moreover, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistic to test significance of systemic risk beta based on tail risk and further rank the systemic risk contribution. Finally, we test the determinants of systemic risk contribution in a forward-looking way. Regulators could detect those firms that are most threatening to the stability of system.

We find default increasing with originating loan-to-value and falling in the origination debt service ratio. A non-linear cubic spline model is used to identify threshold effects and we identify clear turning points in these relationships. This analysis could provide one input into supervisory considerations when setting limits in a macro prudential context.

This study focuses on O/D-based analysis, which has been rarely studied due to the limited data in the context of travel time variability. The objectives of the study are twofold: to shed light on the O/D-based travel time variability and to get insights on travel time variability in the context of Seoul Metropolitan Area. This study utilizes the web information to obtain real-time estimated travel time data, and employs a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to model the travel time distributions. The GMM parameters are found to be useful to fit travel time distribution, which exhibits skewness and multimodality, to identify underlying travel time states and to explain variability. The results indicate that O/D-based travel time variability can be characterized and that higher variability occurs during peak hours. In general, the selected O/D pairs are found to have four travel time states but exhibit different patterns. The existence of alternative paths seem to reduce travel time variability at the O/D level. The results suggest directions for future research and implementation of policies.","[Kim, Sung Hoo] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Chung, Jin-Hyuk] Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Yonsei University,"Chung, JH (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",skim3020@gatech.edu; jinchung@yonsei.ac.kr,"Chung, JinHyuk/G-8566-2012",,,,,,33,12,13,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Firm value declines less when CDS trading is likely to produce incremental information, suggesting that CDS trading has informational benefits for firm value.

Essentially, the main empirical problem is that a researcher observes numerous large-scale purchases of foreign currency but a general absence of sales. This asymmetry has motivated the use of heavily dependent parametric models. We take a fresh look at this problem by allowing for a more flexible estimation, robust to various model specifications. Our results indicate that our method outperforms some of the standard models used to date. Hence, our main contribution is to provide policymakers with an improved and readily accessible toolkit to evaluate their actions. To shed some light on this, we estimate policy functions for the cases of Turkey and Colombia and highlight marked differences with the related literature.","[Ordonez-Callamand, Daniel] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia; [Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio; Melo-Velandia, Luis F.] Banco Republ Colombia, Bogota, Colombia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Villamizar-Villegas, M (通讯作者)，Banco Republ Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.",mvillavi@banrep.gov.co,"Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio/C-6613-2017","Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio/0000-0001-8866-9638",,,,,57,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

To obtain better insights into the role and performance of the taxi (and hire car/limousine) sector, the Victorian Government, in 2012, commissioned a study into the demand for taxi services, which included an investigation of attitudes towards the various public transport, taxis and hire car modes, as a way of identifying the important attributes that influence customer opinions about various modes and how satisfied they are with actual modal services that they had experienced. The evidence is used to refocus the effort of the regulator and other organisations such as taxi associations and vehicle owners in improving service levels that accord with customer expectations. Surveys were undertaken for a sample of travellers in central Melbourne, those using the airport and in regional centres of Victoria for five segments (i.e., tourists, day to day activity, business, night time travel, and disability and pensioner card holders). Based on the sample, a model is proposed and operationalised that provides insights into the degree of satisfaction respondents hold for both taxi and hire car services in Melbourne, with suggestions on where improvement are warranted.","[Rose, John M.] Univ Technol Sydney, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Hensher, David A.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Sydney,"Hensher, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, ITLS, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",john.rose-1@uts.edu.au; David.Hensher@sydney.edu.au,"Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021","Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",Victorian Department of Transport,Victorian Department of Transport,This study was undertaken on behalf of the Victorian Taxi Industry Inquiry and funded by the Victorian Department of Transport.

Theoretical research suggests that money managers' short-term focus stems from their career concerns and greater fund transparency can amplify these concerns. Using a difference-in-differences design around a regulatory shock that increased the transparency of fund managers' portfolio choices, we examine whether increased transparency encourages myopic corporate investment behavior. We find that corporate innovation declines following the regulatory shock. Moreover, evidence from mutual fund trading behavior corroborates that the increased short-term focus of money managers drives the results.","[Agarwal, Vikas] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, 35 Broad St,Suite 1234, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Vashishtha, Rahul; Venkatachalam, Mohan] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Duke University,"Agarwal, V (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, 35 Broad St,Suite 1234, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",vagarwal@gsu.edu,"Agarwal, Vikas/AAR-5706-2020","Agarwal, Vikas/0000-0002-9099-8542","Fuqua School of Business; J.

The S-curve found in sectors representing 30 percent of total industrial production suggests that in these cases competitive devaluations have a positive effect on the TB in the short run. Our findings have important policy implications: since only large competitive devaluations can restore TB equilibrium, industrial restructuring would appear to be a more sensible strategy, though this cannot be achieved in the short run and is instead a medium- to long-term goal.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Costamagna, Rodrigo] Univ Savana, INALDE Business Sch, Km 7, Costado Occidental, Chia, Colombia; [Rossini, Gustavo] Univ Nacl Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina",Brunel University; National University of the Littoral,"Costamagna, R (通讯作者)，Univ Savana, INALDE Business Sch, Km 7, Costado Occidental, Chia, Colombia.",Rodrigo.costamagna@inalde.edu.co,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

While aging has been a matter of concern for upper-middle and high income economies, rapid population growth is set to continue in the poorest countries over the coming decades. At the same time, these countries will see sustained increases in the working-age shares of their population, and these shifts have the potential to boost growth and reduce poverty. This paper describes the main mechanisms through which demographic change may affect economic outcomes, and estimates the association between changes in the share of working-age population with per capita growth and poverty rate. An increase in the working-age population share and a reduction in the child dependency ratio are found to be associated with an increase in gross domestic product per capita growth, with similarly positive effects on poverty reduction.

We attempt to answer the following research questions: (i) To what extent do systemic effects arising from agent interactions within the transport network mitigate or enhance any potential benefits of workplace sharing? (ii) How are these effects changed by informal workplace practices influenced by organizational structure and corporate culture, as opposed to formal business policy? We have been able to show that there are potential benefits to workplace sharing, particularly within a large organization with spatially distributed workplaces. Indeed, the greater the flexibility available, the larger the potential gains, especially with participation of the whole workforce across all employers. However, the apparent benefits of workplace sharing for commuting times and CO2 emissions from transport can be negated by organizational structure and corporate culture. Informal policies whereby team leaders stipulate collocation of team members to facilitate day-to-day and face-to-face interaction can even lead to a worse situation than the case where there is no workplace sharing. The effect of the sharing programmes also depends on the spatial distribution of existing road network, as well as industrial and residential areas. The work acts as a warning that apparently attractive win-win policies with the potential to promote better staff welfare, reduce pollution and make more efficient use of infrastructure can be negated by informal practices in workplaces. It is a step towards a general policy simulation platform where the effectiveness of transport policies can be tested and potential unintended consequences detected before they are implemented in reality, by which time it may be too late or costly to correct any unintended negative effects.","[Ge, Jiaqi; Polhill, J.

The objective of this article is to determine the influence of the population's level of education on the recycling rate of waste. The article has a contribution to the scientific literature, by analyzing the correlation between education and the recycling rate in Europe, with living conditions and internet access as control variables. Results of a panel data analysis show that a high percentage of the population with only primary or lower secondary education, influence negatively the recycling rate of waste in an economy, while tertiary education has a positive influence on the level of recycled waste. Therefore, different policies which aim to increase the education level of the population will have an effect on the recycling rate.","[Pelau, Corina; Chinie, Alexandra Catalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pelau, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",corinapelau@yahoo.com,"Chinie, Catalina/GNP-4906-2022; Pelau, Corina/F-4663-2015","Pelau, Corina/0000-0002-6139-028X",,,,,33,16,17,5,33,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,340,355,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/340,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500008,0

We find strong support for the mechanism of the Baumol model since manufacturing productivity is the most important determinant of relative public-sector prices. Greater political fragmentation has also contributed to the price growth, but its quantitative effect is smaller than that of manufacturing productivity. An analysis of a labor-intensive private service (restaurants and cafes) supports the broader relevance of the Baumol mechanism and the validity of the estimated effect of political fragmentation on the two sectors considered herein.","[Borge, Lars-Erik; Tovmo, Per] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Hove, Kjetil Hatlebakk; Lillekvelland, Tobias] Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, POB 25, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian Defence Research Establishment,"Borge, LE (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",lars.erik.borge@ntnu.no; kjetil.hove@ffi.no; t.lillekve@gmail.com; per.tovmo@ntnu.no,,"Hove, Kjetil Hatlebakk/0000-0002-2209-228X",,,,,48,1,2,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2018,175.0,1-2,,,,,1,18,,10.1007/s11127-018-0510-z,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GA6QA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428457000001,0

It also looks at the interaction between climate and nutrient reduction policy and the extent to which one policy can be used to meet the other's objectives. We use a non-linear, partial equilibrium mathematical programming model of New Zealand land use to assess the economic impacts of climate and water policies at the New Zealand territorial authority level. The spatially explicit agro-environmental economic model estimates changes in land use, agricultural output, land management, and environmental impacts. The policies investigated include a range of carbon prices on land-based emissions ($0-30/tCO) as well a range of prices on nitrogen leaching from diffuse sources ($0-30/kgN). We estimate that implementing stand-alone greenhouse gas and nutrient emissions reduction policies for the agricultural and forestry sectors will create environmental benefits outside the scope of the policy. However, not all environmental outputs improve, and net farm revenue declines by between 0 and 11%. Simultaneously implementing the two policies results in the desired goals of reductions in nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions with a marginal economic burden on landowners (i.e. 1-2% additional loss in farm profit relative to a stand-alone policy).","[Greenhalgh, Suzie; Samarasinghe, Oshadhi] Landcare Res New Zealand, 231 Morrin Rd, Auckland 1072, New Zealand; [Daigneault, Adam] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Daigneault, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 5755 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",adam.daigneault@maine.edu; greenhalghs@landcareresearch.co.nz; samarasingheo@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Daigneault, Adam/GYU-9342-2022","Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727",Landcare Research; NZ Ministry of Primary Industries,Landcare Research; NZ Ministry of Primary Industries,"Funding for this research was provided by Landcare Research and the NZ Ministry of Primary Industries.

The architects of the HIPC initiative and MDRI posited that these programs would spur growth and investment. This paper exploits the variability of participation in the HIPC initiative and MDRI across time and country, in order to identity the effect of participation on growth and investment. I find that the decision point and post-completion point periods of the enhanced HIPC initiative are associated with a 1.762 percentage point and 3.139 percentage point increase in public investment, respectively. The impact is higher in countries with low access to international capital markets. The enhanced HIPC initiative increases private investment by 1.838 percentage points during the post-completion point period in countries with low access to international capital, for approximately two years, but has no effect on growth or foreign direct investment. I find no effect of the original HIPC initiative or MDRI on growth, private investment, public investment or foreign direct investment. I find no heterogeneous impact of the enhanced HIPC initiative on growth and foreign direct investment by level of indebtedness, access to international capital markets, or institutional quality. As the measures of institutional quality have barely changed between 1996 and 2014 in HIPC countries, the results of this paper suggest that without a strong improvement in institutional quality, debt relief is unlikely to boost investment and growth in Africa. Possible future debt relief in SSA countries should be associated with a component directly aimed at improving institutional quality. If an improvement of institutional quality is not feasible in the short run, debt relief in SSA countries should aim to support public investment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We build a model of a closed economy inhabited by overlapping generations of finitely-lived individuals whose labour productivity depends on their age through the build-up of labour market experience and the depreciation of human capital. We make two contributions to the literature on the macroeconomics of population ageing. First, we show that it is important to recognize that a longer life need not imply a more productive life and that this matters for the affordability of an unfunded pension system. Second, we find that factor prices could move in a direction opposite to the one accepted as conventional wisdom following an increase in longevity, if this increase is accompanied by a sufficient decline in the rate of human capital depreciation.","[Heijdra, Ben J.] Univ Groningen, Netspar, CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Reijnders, Laurie S.

In this paper, we investigate how the structure of those networks can affect the capacity of regulators to assess the level of systemic risk. We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses.

A Meta-regression Analysis,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,income poverty; government spending; meta-regression analysis; pro-poor growth; fiscal policy,PRO-POOR; GROWTH; TRANSFERS,"This paper presents the results of a meta-regression analysis of the relationship between government spending and income poverty, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. Through a comprehensive search and screening process, we identify a total of 19 cross-country econometric studies containing 169 estimates of this relationship. We find that the size and direction of the estimated relationship are affected by a range of factors, most notably the composition of the sample used for estimation, the control variables included in the regression model, and the type of government spending. Overall, we find no clear evidence that higher government spending has played a significant role in reducing income poverty in low- and middle-income countries. This is consistent with the view that fiscal policy plays a much more limited redistributive role in developing countries, in comparison with OECD countries. In addition, we find that the relationship between government spending and poverty is on average less negative for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and more negative for countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, compared to other regions. We also find that the relationship is less negative for government consumption spending, in comparison with other sectors. Finally, we find some evidence indicating the possibility of publication bias. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In addition, these positive relationships will be strengthened when new technology ventures face an environmental jolt, such as the Great Recession. An empirical analysis of longitudinal data on new technology ventures in the manufacturing industry from the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS) broadly supports our hypotheses. The results show that all dimensions of founder human capital increase new technology ventures' R&D search intensity, and the positive effect of same-industry work experience becomes stronger during the Great Recession. However, in contrast to our expectation, the positive effect of prior entrepreneurial experience is weaker during the Great Recession, not stronger. Furthermore, we do not find support for our hypothesis that the positive relationship between founders' formal education and new technology ventures' R&D search intensity is stronger during the Great Recession. These seemly contradictory results suggest that although the different dimensions of founder human capital are all positively related to new technology ventures' R&D search intensity, they exert divergent impacts on it when confronting an environmental jolt. As such, our study extends the situational and institutional determinants of R&D search intensity by focusing on founders' human capital and provides deeper insights by considering environmental conditions. By shifting the focus from established firms to new ventures, our study also enriches the understanding of new technology ventures' innovative activities.","[Cao, Xian] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, 2011 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06268 USA; [Im, Junyon] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, 181 Freedman Crescent, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Connecticut; University of Manitoba,"Cao, X (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, 2011 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06268 USA.",xian.cao@business.uconn.edu; Junyon.Im@umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,79,24,26,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Complex sample designs of the type employed in the KFS typically have multi-frame sampling, stratification, non-response adjustment, and over-sampling components. Each of these design elements has been proven to enhance the efficiency with which researchers analyze and draw inferences from the available data. However, there is also a risk that a complex sample design approach can make data analysis more complicated due to non-independent selections and selection with varying probabilities. In this technical overview of the KFS, we describe the sampling method that was utilized in the panel survey. We examine how failing to take into account the probability-based weights impact the parameter estimates and the resulting standard errors. Through adopting an empirical approach, we show why it is important to take account of stratification and weighting. This paper demonstrates the importance of taking the features of a complex survey design into account during the data analysis process.","[Farhat, Joseph] Cent Connecticut State Univ, New Britain, CT 06050 USA; [Robb, Alicia] Next Wave Ventures, Boulder, CO USA; [Robb, Alicia] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Farhat, J (通讯作者)，Cent Connecticut State Univ, New Britain, CT 06050 USA.",farhatjob@ccsu.edu,"Farhat, Joseph/HJH-3080-2023","Farhat, Joseph/0000-0002-3715-8202",,,,,15,12,12,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Psychopathy and professional success are multidimensional constructs, and thus certain elements of psychopathy may be related more strongly to certain elements of professional success. Also, psychopathic traits, comprising self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness, may not predict professional success above and beyond the Big Five. We investigated whether self-centered impulsivity, fearless dominance, and coldheartedness predicted professional satisfaction (satisfaction with salary, with promotion, and with career) as well as material success (annual salary, number of promotions, and professional standing) in an occupational sample (N = 439). Self-centered impulsivity was inversely related to professional satisfaction, whereas fearless dominance was positively related to professional satisfaction and material success. Coldheartedness was related to neither of them. Adding the Big Five, as well as participant gender and time in job, as predictors revealed that extraversion and self-centered impulsivity predicted professional satisfaction, whereas only extraversion predicted material success; fearless dominance was no longer a significant predictor of material success. Taken together, self-centered impulsivity was negatively linked, whereas fearless dominance was positively linked, to professional success. The findings highlight the differential contribution of impulsiveness-versus fearlessness-related elements of psychopathic traits to professional satisfaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

German law mandates that firms' supervisory boards consist of an equal number of employees' and owners' representatives. This requirement, however, applies only to firms with more than two thousand domestic employees. We exploit this discontinuity and the law's introduction in 1976 for identification and find that direct employee power increases financial leverage. This is explained by a supply side effect: as banks' interests are similar to those of employees, higher employee power reduces agency conflicts with debt providers, leading to better financing conditions. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of direct employee influence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study provides quantitative empirical evidence about the motivations for implementing a food safety management system based on ISO 22000. By employing factor analysis and multiple linear regression, it analyses the benefits that the ISO 22000 certified companies gained through certification, as well as the main constraints that may prevent the adoption of the standard in the food industry. The survey is based on a sample of Romanian companies distributed at all levels of the food chain, but mainly at the production level. While there exist external pressures that lead companies to adopt a food safety management system based on ISO 22000, the motivations that are most relevant in this decision are generally internal in nature. The results of our study identify three major benefits of ISO 22000 certification: food safety improvement and provision of safer products, reduction of illness and other risks arising from food and improvement of consumers' confidence. Also, it points out three constraints limiting the dissemination and use of ISO 22000: employees' qualification, costs associated with food safety management system implementation and legal requirements.","[Paunescu, Carmen; Argatu, Ruxandra; Lungu, Miruna] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Paunescu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",carmen.paunescu@ase.ro,"Paunescu, Carmen/ABD-1883-2020",,,,,,32,12,14,2,25,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,30,45,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800003,0

Evidence from the 2014 Floods in Northern Bangladesh,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,resilience capacity; climate shocks; food security; Bangladesh,COPING STRATEGIES; CHILD GROWTH; POLICY; DROUGHT,"Using data collected before and after the catastrophic flooding that took place in northern Bangladesh in 2014, this paper contributes to the growing evidence on the factors enhancing households' resilience to shocks, or their resilience capacities. The analysis takes into account all three dimensions of resilience capacity absorptive, adaptive, and transformative as well as a broad range of specific capacities supporting them. In addition to disaster preparedness and mitigation, it finds suggestive evidence that the following capacities reduced the negative impact of the flooding on household food security: social capital, human capital, exposure to information, asset holdings, livelihood diversity, safety nets, access to markets and services, women's empowerment, governance, and psycho-social capabilities such as aspirations and confidence to adapt. The paper highlights the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to understanding the determinants of resilience in future research, one that accounts for the full range of potential capacities. It also points to the value of taking a cross-sectoral, multi intervention approach to on-the-ground resilience programing in Bangladesh and other developing country areas that are increasingly vulnerable to climate shocks.

In empirical part is surveyed an influence of determinants on life insurance demand, using econometric models based on time series and principal component analysis. We used autoregressive distributed lag model, which defines short-term relationships between principal components and an error correction model, which examines long-term relationships between time series. It was found that an increase in average wage and banking sector size had a positive impact on life insurance demand and an increase in young dependency ratio, old dependency ratio, interest rate and net national savings had a negative impact on life insurance demand.

We address two related questions. The first question asks if we can find evidence of a differentiated effect of employment of members of the family versus hired workers on the business performance. A second question tackles the respective effects of various dimensions of social networks on business technical efficiency. The hypothesis is that, beyond the channel of labour productivity, entrepreneurs that are confronted with an unfavourable social environment may produce less efficiently and realise a lower output than what could be possible with the same amount of resources. We find evidence of a marginal productivity differential between family and hired labour and highlight results consistent with the presence of adverse social network effects faced by households running a business, in particular ethnic minorities. We also stress the importance of professional networks for successful entrepreneurship.","[Chi Huu Nguyen] Univ Paris 13 Nord, Villetaneuse, France; [Nordman, Christophe J.] Univ Paris 09, French Natl Res Inst Sustainable Dev IRD, DIAL, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Nordman, CJ (通讯作者)，IRD, DIAL, 4 Rue Enghien, F-75010 Paris, France.",nordman@dial.prd.fr,"PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012","Nordman, Christophe Jalil/0000-0002-8368-4086",,,,,50,20,20,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

It demonstrates that the post-crisis changes in pension system reduced pension wealth of workers in Poland and increased in Lithuania and Slovakia. The change did not have significant impact on pension wealth in Estonia and Romania. The magnitude of this effect is highest in those countries where the reduction of the fully-funded pension contribution was permanent. Loss or gain in pension wealth varies with age of participants - it is higher for younger people, who will accumulate their pension wealth to a larger extent after the change. The level of the change in pension wealth depends also on the wage level - higher earners lose more relative to the average wage level. The difference in pension wealth depends also on the difference between rates of return in fully funded and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) components of the pension system. The net outcome of post-crisis pension system modifications depends both on the magnitude of fully-funded contribution reduction, but also on the design of PAYG component and the way individual pension rights are accrued. These results indicate the rise in implicit liability of pension system in Slovakia to be higher than the reduction of the explicit liability caused by the pension system change and the lower rise of implicit liability in Poland and Latvia.","[Chlon-Dominczak, Agnieszka] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Madalinskiego 6-8, PL-02513 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Chlon-Dominczak, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Stat & Demog, Madalinskiego 6-8, PL-02513 Warsaw, Poland.",achlon@sgh.waw.pl,"Chłoń-Domińczak, Agnieszka/AAH-2673-2020","Chłoń-Domińczak, Agnieszka/0000-0001-5068-0276",National Science Centre in Poland [UMO-2012/05/B/HS4/04206],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",Research in this paper was financed from grant number UMO-2012/05/B/HS4/04206 from the National Science Centre in Poland.

While these programs typically work with a limited group of beneficiaries, little is known about the potential community impact beyond these beneficiaries. To investigate this, we empirically analyze how cooperative behavior develops in a lab-in-the-field experiment with mixed groups of CDR program beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, organized in 42 municipalities in Colombia with active CDR programs. In the experiment, we use two rounds of a binary public goods game with a communication stage between both rounds. The experimental data are complemented with information on pre-existing social proximity among the participants and whether they have participated in a CDR program. We find that cooperation increases after communication, and that it correlates positively with the proportion of cooperators before communication. This peer effect is mainly driven by the cooperative behavior of CDR program beneficiaries while the influence of non-beneficiaries is limited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This finding is both economically and statistically significant, and remains even upon controlling for various fixed effects, the endogenous choice of currency, the adjustment of the forward exchange rate to the loan spreads, and lending relationships. We show that the foreign currency effect tends to be stronger when banks from advanced economies are lending in their home currency, loans are syndicated in more mature markets, the capital account openness of the borrower's country is lower, and financial institutions within the borrower's country are not well capitalized. In addition, the foreign currency effect was more pronounced during the financial crisis and its aftermath, likely a result from the spillover effect of accommodative monetary measures and higher counterparty risk. In terms of policy implication, although cheaper foreign currency syndicated loans allow corporations in emerging economies to access credit at a desirable cost, over-borrowing in foreign currency nonetheless increases the overall financial fragility of these countries.

In a neoclassical model of a firm with costly scale adjustment options, we show that the effect of scale flexibility (i.e., contraction and expansion options) is to determine the relation between risk and operating leverage: risk increases with operating leverage for inflexible firms, but decreases for flexible firms. Guided by theory, we construct easily reproducible proxies for inflexibility and operating leverage.

Given that stock return volatility measures risk, if the gridlock argument holds, stock market volatility should be lower under divided than under a unified government. Using a partisan conflict index (PCI), we empirically confirm this theoretical argument for the U.S. stock market based on quantiles-based regressions. In particular, quantile-on-quantile regressions show that PCI tends to predict reduced volatility, with the effect being stronger at levels of volatility that are moderately low (i.e., below the median, but not at its extreme) for an increase in the predictor, especially with moderately low and high initial values (i.e., when PCI is at quantiles around the median).","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Tunis, Campus Univ,Ave 7 Novembre, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Selmi, Refk] Univ Pau, Pau, France; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; Helmut Schmidt University; Universite de Tunis; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; c.pierdzioch@hsu-hh.de; s.refk@yahoo.fr; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,25,38,40,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

Turning the principle into a workable policy is important as a support for restructured electricity markets. A challenge is to make the different measures of benefits commensurable, and to find approximations that honor the principle without imposing a standard of perfection. A framework for such cost allocation uses examples from existing models and transmission investment studies to describe how the cost allocation principle could apply within the limits of available analytical capabilities.","[Hogan, William W.] Harvard Univ, Mossavar Rahmani Ctr Business & Govt, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Hogan, WW (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Mossavar Rahmani Ctr Business & Govt, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",william_hogan@harvard.edu,"Hogan, William/JWO-8984-2024",,,,,,31,13,13,0,4,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Namely, this law permits use of twice higher and twice lower depreciation rates, in relation to those prescribed by the Law, and that kind of depreciation cost will still be tax-deductible. In the paper, the comparative balance sheet as well as the profit and loss account show the value of assets and liabilities in the case that company used the twice lower or twice higher depreciation rates instead of the actual ones in the reviewed year. Impacts on the performance indicators are also integral part of comparative analysis. Results have leaded us to the conclusion that application of twice lower or twice higher depreciation rates had the statistically significant influence on financial reports. An important contribution of this paper is the analysis of different influence of such depreciation policy on the certain performance indicators. Some of them are more sensitive to the various depreciation rates. That is why complex analysis has to take into account particular influence of various depreciation rates on a certain performance indicator.","[Jurun, Tomislav] Obrt Usluge, Kaciceva 9, Split 21000, Croatia; [Ramljak, Branka; Jurun, Elza] Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",,"Jurun, T (通讯作者)，Obrt Usluge, Kaciceva 9, Split 21000, Croatia.",tomislav.jurun2@gmail.com; bramljak@efst.hr; elza@elst.hr,"Ramljak, Branka/ABA-4164-2020",,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,307,315,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000031,0

'Tashu', a public bicycle sharing system in Daejeon, was installed in 2009 and it is one of the well-established public bike-sharing systems in South Korea. Previous studies in the literature found that in general, bicycling is affected by weather conditions and temporal characteristics. However, the degrees of impacts or the signs of effects may be different depending on the stations. Therefore, this study investigated the different effects of weather conditions and temporal characteristics according to the characteristics of the stations at the station level analysis in addition to the system level analysis. For the cost-effective station level analysis, clustering analysis was utilized to find out the groups of the stations with the similar properties. Moreover, temperature humidity index (THI) and the indicator variable of heatwaves were introduced to consider the interaction between temperature and humidity and measure the influence of high temperature, which has been rarely considered. In the system level analysis, the results showed that the selected factors have the different influence over the different time periods within a day. Especially, scorching heat and non-working days differently affect the demand for public bikes by hours. Also, it was observed that high temperature over 30 degrees C reduces the bicycle usage, which revealed the necessity of taking into account not only severe colds but also heatwaves in the prediction of the demand. By clustering analysis, the stations were partitioned into the three clusters. One cluster shows the strong peak in the morning while two others have peaks in the evening. The effects of weather conditions and non-working days on the demand for public bicycles were different depending on the clusters, which seemed to be related to the main purposes of bike usage in the clusters.","[Kim, Kyoungok] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol SeoulTech, Int Fus Sch, Informat Technol Management Programme, 232 Gongreungno, Seoul 139743, South Korea",Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol SeoulTech, Int Fus Sch, Informat Technol Management Programme, 232 Gongreungno, Seoul 139743, South Korea.",Kyoungok.kim@seoultech.ac.kr,,"Kim, Kyoungok/0000-0002-0196-3832","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT \& Future Planning) [2017R1C1B5014805]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT \& Future Planning)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT \& Future Planning) (No. 2017R1C1B5014805).",,24,93,99,10,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

The results reveal that the Brazilian beef packers and institutions within the export sector have little knowledge regarding the Chinese market. Neither the size nor the export experience of the beef packing firms and the foreign direct investment seem to significantly influence the quality of the knowledge they hold on the Chinese beef market. The sector has neither an integrated database containing the essential information on the Chinese market nor a unified traceability system in place that could facilitate the information flow among the agents within the beef supply chain.

The analysis follows a data panel statistical and econometric approach by using the above financial data for the four systemic banking groups. The study period covers the phases of precrisis expansion of the Greek banking sector, as well as its shrinkage during the crisis, leading in evidence that group consolidation levels are influenced by spatial factors.

This paper takes China's listed companies as the research object, using the annual financial data of listed companies in China A stock market from 2006 to 2015, using discretionary accrued profits and dividend payout as a measure of market mispricing and corporate financial-constraints respectively to explore the impact of the capital market mispricing on the financing choice for companies with different financial-constraints. The results show that mispricing has a significant positive effect on companies' equity financing and debt financing regardless of financial constraints. Specifically, we find that the positive effect of mispricing on equity financing of high financial-constraints companies is lower than that of low financial-constraints companies. However, for debt financing, the result is opposite.","[Ling Chen] Dept Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Xuanwuqv Xiaolingwei 200, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; Inst Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Xuanwuqv Xiaolingwei 200, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Ling, C (通讯作者)，Dept Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Xuanwuqv Xiaolingwei 200, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lsbccj@sina.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,2,5,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-10-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,13,16,,10.26480/icefs.01.2018.13.16,0.0,,,4,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6HR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454212200003,0

These frameworks include cultural norms, life course effects and material exchange. The paper is based on 19 in-depth qualitative family case studies, which are linked to a wider set of quantitative survey data. Care arrangements and bargaining processes are revealed to be highly gendered, and largely conform to prevailing cultural norms. Rather than neutral and objective, the self-identified role as main carer is found to be subjective and potentially ambiguous. The few men who self-identify as main carers are more likely to play an indirect, organisational role than engage directly in daily care. As such, bargaining mainly relates to which woman performs the main care role, and large family networks mean that there is usually more than one candidate carer. Bargaining can occur inter-generationally and conjugally, but bargaining between siblings is of particular importance. Bargaining is framed by the uncertain trajectory of older people's care needs, and arrangements are sometimes reconfigured in response to changing care needs or family circumstances. Taking the narratives at face value, the influence of life course effects on bargaining and care arrangements is more obvious than material exchange. There are, however, indications that economic considerations, particularly inheritance, still play an important behind the scenes role.","[Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Earlham Rd,Arts Bldg, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mayston, Rosie; Prince, Martin] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Acosta, Alberto; Luisa Sosa, Ana; Montes de Oca, Veronica] Natl Inst Neurol & Neurosurg, Lab Dementias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gallardo, Sara; Guerra, Mariella] Inst Memoria & Desordenes Relacionados, Lima, Peru",University of East Anglia; University of London; King's College London,"Lloyd-Sherlock, P (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Earlham Rd,Arts Bldg, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",p.lloyd-sherlock@uea.ac.uk,"Prince, Martin J/A-9170-2010; Guerra, Mariella/E-3582-2010; Ortiz, Ana Luisa Sosa/AAU-9376-2021; Mayston, Rosie/N-2414-2013","Ortiz, Ana Luisa Sosa/0000-0003-3930-3618; Mayston, Rosie/0000-0002-2758-0194; Acosta Castillo, Gilberto Isaac/0000-0002-8664-9542; Lloyd-Sherlock, Peter/0000-0002-1367-0703; Guerra, Mariella/0000-0001-8923-349X",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-167-25- 0]; ESRC [ES/I034331/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [RES-167-25- 0];,,75,15,16,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The results show that industry type and institutional ownership have no effect on ISR. That is, that companies in both high profile and low profile industry groups do the same disclosure of social responsibility in sharia. Likewise, the ownership of both large and small institutional will still do the disclosure of social responsibility. While Return On Asset and the size of the company affect the ISR.

The reallocation of resources in the economy in favor of the provision of public services therefore has a certain degree of inefficiency in itself. This degree of inefficiency could be reduced by introducing alternative ways of securing public goods on a voluntary basis when individuals are not guided only by financial motives but also by social or behavioral motives such as altruism, warm-glow effect, and social norms. Regardless of whether this is a field or laboratory experiment, the level of voluntary provision of public goods can be affected in a positive or in a negative way. The ability of an experimenter to influence a particular factor by a different set of instruction can significantly affect the willingness of individuals to voluntarily pay for public goods. The aim of the paper is to find out if different instructions lead to a different rate of voluntary payment for public goods. We assume that individuals are particularly affected by internal factors when deciding. Individuals' decision whether to voluntarily pay has been influenced by risk perception, warm-glow effects and the social position of the individual.","[Merickova, Beata Mikusova; Muthova, Nikoleta] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Mericková, BM (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ & Reg Dev, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",beata.mikusovamer-ickova@umb.sk,"Muthova, Nikoleta Jakus/AAN-8216-2021; Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/AAN-7235-2021","Muthova, Nikoleta Jakus/0000-0001-8700-5055; Meričková, Beáta Mikušová/0000-0002-3187-9201",Czech Grant Agency GACR,Czech Grant Agency GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research is supported by the Czech Grant Agency GACR under the contract No. GA16-13119S - Performance management in public administration - theory vs. practices in the Czech Republic and other CEE countries.,,29,0,0,0,4,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2283-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,89,95,,,,,,7,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL8FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456200200012,0

This single factor can be much more significant than many realize. Goodwill is not abstract but has a definitive monetary value which, as an investment, can be ascertained to the penny. It is the result of an acquisition which resulted in an excess in cost of acquisition above the revalued assets minus liabilities. Since its inception in the late nineteenth century, it has been debated. But M&A activity has been on the increase in recent years, and it may soon be impossible to ignore the impact goodwill may have both on the asset side of the balance sheet and the shareholder's equity. This paper argues that in the end, amortizing the goodwill to cycle it off the balance sheet, while not perfect, is probably better than keeping it on the balance sheet awaiting impairment. The question is therefore: Should goodwill be amortized, and how consistent ids this with current accounting practices?","[Muir, David John] Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"Muir, DJ (通讯作者)，Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic.",david.muir@aauni.edu,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,24,30,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900003,0

Based on 7 months of field research in a key gold producing region of West Kalimantan, I argue that gold's presence, discovery, and informal extraction creates resource frontiers, and that within these frontiers, mining labor practices, property relations, and gold mining-related secret knowledges converge to generate resource territories. While development practitioners, agrarian scholars, and government officials represent mining sites as chaotic and lacking institutional order, I show that a clearly understood organization of life and work animates the territorial subjects and territorialized spaces that small-scale mining populates in both urban and rural mining territories. The article challenges views of territory and territorialization as an imposition of government on the people and resources within spatial boundaries. Territories with no formalized boundaries in Indonesian gold country emerge through specific production practices engaging labor, resource access, and situated knowledges. The complex entanglements of legalities and illegalities suggest that smallholder gold production spaces are ungovernable through centralized state regulatory institutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

There are important messages in the paper for social insurance policies design, structures and management, the meaning of data mining and collection, and for model refinement with modelling approaches in a systems' thinking way. The shortcomings of national social insurance systems in dealing more effectively with upstream social insurance risk prevention in population are systemic, and include also a failure to empower members of population and involve them in their own, entrepreneurial downstream care. The paper contains a system dynamics point of view, as a method of macroscopic, continuous simulation modelling, to surface and explain some cycles and discrepancies between demography, management policies, system's aspects of national social insurance, particularly pension system. The conceptual and simulation model presented in the paper, followed by experiments' results, uses SD method approach with causal loop diagrams (CLD) and stock-and-flow diagrams (SFD), displaying delays, amplifications and structure cycle dynamics in national pension system. Further research should concentrate on the detailed analysis of additional modelling requirements in order to conduct more profound multi-factor experiments to forecast and evaluate contemporary national politics, and to test some new assumptions in social insurance.","[Pietron, Roman] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Pietron, R (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland.",roman.pietron@pwr.edu.pl,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,LODZ UNIV TECHNOLOGY PR,LODZ,"BIBLIOTEKA POLITECHNIKI LODZKIEJ-BUDYNEK B22, UL WOLCZANSKA 223, LODZ, 90-924, POLAND",,,978-83-7283-900-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,76,88,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470276200007,0

For social services, an estimate of the evolution of the number of beneficiaries of care allowance up to 2030 was drawn up on the basis of an analysis of the evolution in the number of beneficiaries of this social benefit by sex, age and degree of dependency in the years 2007 to 2016; for healthcare, an estimate of health insurance companies' expected expenditure on healthcare was drawn up on the basis of an analysis of the evolution of spending on healthcare by health insurance companies, broken down by clients' sex and age. The calculations clearly show that both these systems are unprepared for tackling the consequences of population ageing, so the search should begin now for new solutions that would help ensure that both social services and healthcare continue to be provided to clients to the existing standard in the coming period.","[Prusa, Ladislav] Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic",Research Institute for Labour & Social Affairs,"Prusa, L (通讯作者)，Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic.",ladislav.prusa@vupsv.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

To evaluate the deterrence effect of the intervention on monthly tribal violence, I apply a difference-in-differences identification strategy which exploits within-districts variation in the outcome variable (violence) over time. The regression results show that military presence significantly deters tribal violence, that is, it decreases violent incidents by one to five per month. The deterrence effect varies within the given range due to different number of control districts and periods of analysis.

We emphasize the need to evaluate these risks within China's unique economic and financial systems, in which the state and nonstate sectors coexist and the financial system serves as a key tool of the government to fund its economic policies. Overall, we argue that (a) a financial crisis is unlikely to happen in the near future and (b) the ultimate risk lies with China's economic growth, as a vicious circle of distortions in the financial system lowers the efficiency of capital allocation and economic growth and will eventually exacerbate financial risks in the long run.","[Song, Zheng (Michael)] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wei] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Xiong, Wei] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Xiong, Wei] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Management & Econ, Shenzhen 518100, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wei] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Finance Inst, Shenzhen 518100, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wei] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 01238 USA","Chinese University of Hong Kong; Princeton University; Princeton University; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; National Bureau of Economic Research","Song, Z (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zheng.michael.song@gmail.com; wxiong@princeton.edu,"Xiong, Wei/AAD-9426-2022",,,,,,124,69,71,11,104,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

Implementing a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) may exacerbate crowding out because recipient governments should face fewer constraints when allocating health aid. This paper uses rigorous panel data methods to investigate this hypothesised effect of SWAps. We find that SWAps provide not an exacerbating but a potentially protective effect, reducing displacement of government health expenditure. This suggests some aid dollars are more fungible than others, and the mechanism for aid delivery makes a difference.","[Sweeney, Rohan] Deakin Univ, Deakin Hlth Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Sweeney, Rohan; Mortimer, Duncan] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Suhrcke, Marc] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Jeon, Yun Joo] Minist Hlth, Agcy Care Effectiveness, Singapore, Singapore",Deakin University; Monash University; University of York - UK; Ministry of Health-Singapore,"Sweeney, R (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Hlth Econ, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",rohan.sweeney@deakin.edu.au,"Suhrcke, Marc/AAE-9024-2019","Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626; Mortimer, Duncan Stuart/0000-0002-7211-6454; Sweeney, Rohan/0000-0002-3243-9523",University of York,University of York,This work was supported by the University of York.,,55,1,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

A univariate model which outperforms the benchmark during recent past period can also beat the benchmark in the near future out-of-sample. Accordingly, we propose a forecasting strategy that involves switching between a model of interest and the benchmark model, based on observations of their recent past performance. We obtain significant stock return predictability both in statistical and economic terms. Predictability is found to be stronger for longer forecasting horizons. Success of the MoP strategy is also seen in forecasting exchange rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We model this carbon budget as a resource asset depleted by annual GHG emissions, and estimate the user cost associated with depletion. For constant emissions, social welfare increases US$3.3 trillion (6 per cent of global GDP) over the business as usual scenario of growing emissions, and the carbon budget's lifetime increases from 18 to 21 years. For declining emissions, the gain is US$10.4 trillion (19 per cent of global GDP), and the budget's lifetime is 30 years. Extending indefinitely the lifetime of the carbon budget would require emissions to fall exponentially by 4.8 per cent or more. Although the Paris Agreement abatement pledges will generate social gains of US$2-2.5 trillion (4-5 per cent of world GDP), they are insufficient to prevent depletion of the 2(degrees)C global carbon budget by 2030.","[Barbier, Edward B.; Burgess, Joanne C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu; jburgess@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

These disparities reflect both the ability of the public transport system to meet the needs of residents and the locational pros and cons of public service facilities. In this paper, integrated accessibility metrics are used to assess the disparities in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. This is achieved by dividing the urban space into a multilevel grid that can be easily combined with grid-based population data to facilitate accessibility modeling, calculation, and evaluation. Additionally, an acquisition method for more accurate travel time data in the multimodal public transportation network was developed on the basis of an Internet mapping service. This provides a realistic, multimodal, door-to-door modeling approach that avoids the requirement of building complex traffic networks through Geographic Information System (GIS) software and simplifies road network modeling efforts. The results show that this modeling method can be used to reflect the accessibility disparities in the Nanjing urban space objectively and accurately.","[Chen, Jie; Ni, Jianhua; Xi, Changbai; Li, Siqian; Wang, Jiechen] Nanjing Univ, Dept Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jie] Datong Univ, Dept Surveying & Mapping Engn, Datong 037009, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiechen] Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiechen] NanjMg Univ, Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Shanxi Datong University; Nanjing University,"Wang, JC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",chenjie_301@126.com; neejianhua@126.com; xicb11@126.com; lisigian_1994@163.com; wangjiechen@nju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571377]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-13-0280],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(41571377) and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(NCET-13-0280).

We find that exports of natural resources significantly increase China's ODI; this suggests that China's ODI is vertical. Despite this, the relationship between aid and ODI varies according to different types of aid. Aid invested in social and economic infrastructure raises ODI, and the marginal effect diminishes as aid increases. Aid invested in the productive sector and the government, however, negatively impacts ODI, thereby suggesting that China's aid will crowd out its investment in these countries.

We hypothesize that contractual features such as relative performance evaluation (RPE), the performance period length, and the number of performance metrics can be configured to improve the informativeness of performance metrics. Consistent with the hypotheses, we find that firms using market metrics are more likely to adopt RPE and long performance periods than firms using accounting metrics. The effects of performance metrics on RPE and performance periods remain prominent after we allow these features to be jointly determined. Moreover, we find that RPE is positively associated with longer performance periods, suggesting that the two features complement each other in improving the informativeness of performance metrics in p-v equity compensation. Our findings not only reveal the intricate relations between the contractual features, but also provide empirical support for the voting guidelines by proxy advisory services and have implications for the evolving practice of executive compensation.

Given the physical asset losses and the psychological impact on citizens, our expectation was to see a strong correlation between terrorist incidents and financial market valuations.

The arguments presented show that an income transfer policy may generate an economy that not only is sustainable with regard to public debt but also has a low unemployment rate in the long run.","[Kamiguchi, Akira] Hokusei Gakuen Univ, Atsubetsu Ku, Oyachi Nishi 2-3-1, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0048631, Japan",,"Kamiguchi, A (通讯作者)，Hokusei Gakuen Univ, Atsubetsu Ku, Oyachi Nishi 2-3-1, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0048631, Japan.",a-kamiguchi@hokusei.ac.jp,,,,,,,26,0,0,1,5,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2017,73.0,4,,,,,341,360,,10.1628/001522117X14984830902364,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FQ4XV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418363300001,0
