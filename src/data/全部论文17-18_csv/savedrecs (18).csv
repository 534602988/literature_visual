Volume 59, September 2018, Pages 25-28). Besides the model misspecification, omitted results and data availability bias of the regression used to inform the overall results, there are no controls for confounding factors that influence the effective marginal tax rate. These omissions are detrimental to the validity of the paper. This paper seeks to illuminate the sources of those errors and argues that the paper is sufficiently flawed that no weight should be given to its analysis when considering the potential consequences of a company tax rate cut.

J,"Ebenstein, L",,,,"Ebenstein, Lanny",,,Hayek's Divorce and Move to Chicago,ECON JOURNAL WATCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The personal life of a great intellectual is not always highly pertinent. Although Friedrich Hayek may have been, in his son's words, the great philosopher with feet of clay (L. Hayek 1994-1997), his clay feet would not necessarily detract from his scholarly contributions. But since Hayek was a moral philosopher-his title at the University of Chicago was Professor of Social and Moral Science-his personal life may be more relevant than would be the case for intellectuals in other fields. The history of Hayek's personal life has not always, to this point, been accurately told. The story of his divorce and move to Chicago has often been presented as one in which he discovered after World War II on a visit to Vienna to see his mother and other family members that a distant cousin of his, Helene Bitterlich, with whom he had a relationship as a young man, felt free to marry him. After Helene's husband died, she and Hayek decided to marry, requiring Hayek to divorce his first wife, the former Hella Fritsch. At the same time, it has been suggested, he began to feel out of place in England in the immediate postwar era as a result of the policies of the first Labour Party government. He relocated to America, having first sought a post in the Economics Department at the University of Chicago and then, after being turned down by it as a result of The Road to Serfdom (1944), having been offered a position in the Committee on Social Thought. But almost no aspect of this presentation is entirely correct, much of it is factually inaccurate, and much else is omitted. During the 26 years since he died in 1992, considerable information has become available about Hayek's personal life. This includes material on his divorce, second marriage, relocation from the London School of Economics to the Committee on Social Thought, and relationship with the Chicago Economics Department. The purpose of this article is to present much of this information-building largely on extensive archival research by a number of scholars and the memoir of Hayek's last and longtime secretary, Charlotte Cubitt (2006), which is essential reading for anyone interested in the life of Hayek. Together with information this writer has collected, it is now possible to portray Hayek's divorce and move to Chicago more accurately than has previously been the case.","[Ebenstein, Lanny] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Hist Econ Thought & Econ Hist, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Ebenstein, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Hist Econ Thought & Econ Hist, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",ebenstein@econ.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,1,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Competing theories suggest a variety of political institutions as driving forces of social infrastructure, but the empirical literature has been hampered by the small set of available proxies, many of which are broadly defined. We leverage a new, comprehensive dataset that codes political institutions directly from countries' constitutions. By employing a statistical methodology that is designed to juxtapose candidate regressors associated with many competing theories, we test each individual political institution's effect on social infrastructure. Our results show that constitutional rules pertaining to executive constraints as well as to the structure of electoral systems are crucial for the development of high-quality social infrastructure. We also find that the determinants of social infrastructure are much more fundamental than previously thought: not only the general structure of electoral systems matter, but also highly detailed aspects such as limits on campaign contributions and the freedom to form parties. Moreover, the granularity of our data allows us to highlight the profound effect of basic human rights on social infrastructure, a dimension which has not been explored in the literature to date.","[Eicher, Theo S.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Garcia-Penalosa, Cecilia] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille,AMSE, Marseille, France; [Kuenzel, David J.] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Wesleyan University,"Kuenzel, DJ (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, 238 Church St,PAC 123, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",dkuenzel@wesleyan.edu,"Kuenzel, David/L-4212-2019; Eicher, Theo/HZL-8034-2023","Kuenzel, David/0000-0001-7429-3246;",,,,,106,10,10,1,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

We propose a new focus: directly incorporating the underlying shocks that cause exchange rate fluctuations when evaluating how these fluctuations pass through to import and consumer prices. A standard open-economy model shows that the relationship between exchange rates and prices depends on the shocks which cause the exchange rate to move. We build on this to develop a structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for a small open economy and apply it to the UK. We show that prices respond differently to exchange rate movements based on what caused the movements. For example, exchange rate pass-through is low in response to domestic demand shocks and relatively high in response to domestic monetary policy shocks. This framework can improve our ability to estimate how pass-through can change over short periods of time. For example, it can explain why sterling's post-crisis depreciation caused a sharper increase in prices than expected, while the effect of sterling's 2013-15 appreciation was more muted. We also apply this framework to forecast the extent of pass-through from sterling's sharp depreciation corresponding to the UK's vote to leave the European Union. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a comprehensive view of the ECB's monetary policy over these two decades. The first section gives a chronological account of the macroeconomic and monetary policy developments in the euro area since the adoption of the euro in 1999, going through four cyclical phases conditioning ECB monetary policy. We describe the monetary policy decisions from the ECB's perspective and against the background of its evolving monetary policy strategy and framework. We also highlight a number of the key, critical issues that were the subject of debate. The second section contains various assessments. We analyze the achievement of the price stability mandate and developments in the ECB's credibility, and we also investigate the ECB's interest rate decisions through the lens of a simple empirical interest rate reaction function. Finally, we present the ECB's framework for thinking about nonstandard monetary policy measures and review the evidence on their effectiveness. One of the main themes of the paper is how the ECB utilized its monetary policy to respond to the challenges posed by the European twin financial and sovereign debt crises and the subsequent slow economic recovery, making use of its relatively wide range of instruments, defining new ones where necessary, and developing the strategic underpinnings of its policy framework.","[Hartmann, Philipp; Smets, Frank] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Hartmann, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,271,29,30,3,10,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Gained experience updates beliefs on expected payoffs and is used in a range of decisions each individual is facing. In this paper, we focus on the formation of beliefs about the payoffs associated with spatial choices set in an uncertain environment. We task ourselves with better understanding of day-to-day flexibility of actions as a result of continuous update of prior expectations. We built a model where private and common knowledge on expected economic returns blend and lead to divergence of expectations between individuals. This innovation expands the frontiers of spatio-temporal modeling of micro-behavior to offer a new insight on decay of information relevance with increasing spatial and temporal separation. Application to fishermen harvest location choices demonstrates the use of the model. Successful fisheries management must be able to accurately predict the response of fishermen to regulations with particular attention paid to flexible technologies which allow individuals to adjust effort and alter behavior. Good understanding of fishing locations choice and location adjustment flexibility can contribute substantially to a design of management practices with spatial components.","[Hutniczak, Barbara] NOAA NMFS, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Munch, Angela] NOAA NEFSC, Integrated Stat, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Münch, A (通讯作者)，NOAA NEFSC, Integrated Stat, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",barbara.hutniczak@noaa.gov; angela.muench@cefas.co.uk,,"Hutniczak, Barbara/0000-0001-5152-7898",,,,,44,9,11,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

This article reviews this history, beginning 1956 when the government first imposed an industry boundary between transmission of information on the one hand, and the creation and processing of information on the other. This regulatory legacy remains embedded in US law and has led to some of the muddle. This article also examines the academic literature relating to net neutrality. On this, the answers found in the literature vary depending on assumptions made about technology, industry structure, and industry practices. When the answer to the question of whether regulations are beneficial is it depends, and the scenarios that give different answers are realistic, it would seem that the policy approach should favor applying competition and consumer protection laws that address problems when they occur rather than ex ante regulations, which would be certain to harm at least in some situations.","[Jamison, Mark A.] Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Jamison, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Publ Util Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jamisoma@ufl.edu,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The decades of research on discrimination in labor markets began with a regression-based decomposition approach, asking whether raw wage or earnings differences between groups-which might constitute prima facie evidence of discrimination-were in fact attributable to other productivity-related factors. Subsequent research-responding in large part to limitations of the regression-based approach-moved on to other approaches, such as using firm-level data to estimate both marginal productivity and wage differentials. In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth in experimental research on labor market discrimination-although the earliest experiments were done decades ago. Some experimental research on labor market discrimination takes place in the lab. But far more of it is done in the field, which makes this particular area of experimental research unique relative to the explosion of experimental economic research more generally. This paper surveys the full range of experimental literature on labor market discrimination, places it in the context of the broader research literature on labor market discrimination, discusses the experimental literature from many different perspectives (empirical, theoretical, and policy), and reviews both what this literature has taught us thus far, and what remains to be done.","[Neumark, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Neumark, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Neumark, D (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,185,193,219,21,161,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Our estimates suggest that while the income per capita of Belgium, France, Germany and Italy would have been higher without the euro, that of Ireland would have been considerably lower. In contrast, the Netherlands would have been as well off without the euro. We show that these estimates are not contingent on our choice of baseline control groups, growth predictors and pre-treatment period. In addition, we use the insights from the literature on the economic determinants of the costs and benefits of monetary unions to explain our estimates. We find that early euro adopters with a business cycle more synchronized to that of the union and more open to intra-union trade or migration, lost less or gained more from the euro. A key role in increasing post-euro income losses of union members has been played by the integration of capital markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical results show that the increased corruption directly affects economic growth, environmental quality, and energy consumption. However, corruption has an indirect effect on economic growth through energy consumption and environmental quality, an indirect effect on environmental quality through economic growth and an indirect effect on energy consumption through CO2 emissions and GDP. Indeed, energy consumption and CO2 emissions affected the economic growth. Meanwhile, economic growth effected CO2 emissions and energy consumption, and finally, CO2 emissions affected economic growth. Our paper addresses these important issues using the general method of moments (GMM) in panel data. We also find that economic growth in MENA countries reacts negatively to the environmental degradation and political instability.

As an economic prohibition from the majority religion is sustained by a threat of social exclusion from that cultural group, it has less effects on religious minorities. It then creates an occupational pattern where only the religious minorities choose activities that transgress the prohibition. By creating resentment against the religious minorities, this occupational pattern strengthens the diffusion of the majority religion in the population. An economic prohibition is then instigated by the clerics in the majority religion, because it allows them to consolidate their norms and to increase the scope of their control over popular masses. This work also demonstrates that an economic prohibition lasts longer when religious clerics can legitimize secular rulers and when the competition on the religious market is weaker.","[Seror, Avner] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Seror, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",avner.seror@psemail.eu,,"Seror, Avner/0000-0002-2027-280X",European Research Council under the project Tectacom [324004]; European Research Council (ERC) [324004] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the project Tectacom; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"I am grateful to the editor, Nathan Nunn, and to two anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

With the increasing concern about the environmental issue and climate change, the ability to balance the reduction of carbon emissions with economic benefits may to a great extent determine the competitiveness of power generation sector. This study first adopts the game cross-efficiency approach to evaluate the environmental efficiencies of the generation sector in China's 30 provinces. The results indicate that significant efficiency gap does exist among regions. It then employs a system generalized method of moments model to explore the determinants of their performance while eliminating the associated endogeneity issue. Considering the negative correlation between environmental efficiency and the thermal power ratio, the power mix should be adjusted gradually. The per capita regional GDP and capacity utilization rate are positive factors boosting the environmental efficiency. Accordingly, the incentive policies for clean energy development should be differentiated across regions according to their power mix, self-sufficiency ratio, and economic development situations.

Fluctuations in the profitability of strategies rationalize investors' strategy switching behaviors. Under bounded rationality and limited information, such behavior is usually driven by comparing the past performance of different strategies. But at what pace should investors change their strategies? Does a frequent strategy switching lead to a higher wealth in the end? To answer these questions, a discrete dynamic heterogeneous agent model is proposed, in which agents follow heuristic rules and a market maker adjusts the price of a risky asset. Agents are classified by their propensity of strategy switching. It is found that agents with a higher propensity adopt the better strategy more often, but end up with less final wealth. This counter-intuitive phenomenon is caused by the inconsistency between short-run profit and long-run wealth accumulation.","[Zhang, Yu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Weihong] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Nanyang Technological University,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zhangyu@swufe.edu.cn; AWHHuang@ntu.edu.sg,"Huang, Weihong/A-9676-2013","Huang, Weihong/0000-0002-8626-2807; Zhang, Yu/0000-0002-0028-0175",,,,,23,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Since the existing AFSD criterion is not convenient to rank transformations of random variables due to its relying heavily on cumulative distribution functions, the authors propose the AFSD criterion for transformations of random variables by means of transformation functions and the probability function of the original random variable.

Hard rock mining gives a prime example of the artificial selection' of settled customs or working rules by jurists and legislators. The evolving structure of the industry, conditioned by technological and market factors, produced a parallel shift in the locus and control of sovereignty. In the early days sovereignty vested in the mining clubs. The enlarging scale and complexity of mining catalysed a change in both the uses and location of sovereignty. With the transition from prospecting to large-scale industrial mining, the right to use' mineral deposits obtained through patents became contingent on the cooperation of labour. At this stage, the capture of the state's monopoly on legitimate violence to protect the right to use became a crucial dimension of property. Mining companies have also enjoyed liberties with respect to the externalization of environmental costs. The emergent structure of rights, duties, capacities and exposures was instrumental in bringing forth a quantum increase in the mining of hard rock minerals necessary for industrial expansion. There is, however, an urgent need for reform of the mineral patent system.","[Brown, Christopher] Arkansas State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, State Univ, AR 72467 USA",Arkansas State University,"Brown, C (通讯作者)，Arkansas State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, State Univ, AR 72467 USA.",crbrown@astate.edu,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

To analyse the external and internal validities of the results, a comparison between non-parametric, semi-parametric and parametric estimates is presented.","[d'Agostino, Giorgio; Scarlato, Margherita; Napolitano, Silvia] Rome Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"d'Agostino, G (通讯作者)，Rome Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy.",gdagostino@uniroma3.it,,"Scarlato, Margherita/0000-0002-7080-3664; Napolitano, Silvia/0000-0001-6828-5258","SALDRU (Southern Africa Labour & Development Research Unit), University of Cape Town","SALDRU (Southern Africa Labour & Development Research Unit), University of Cape Town","We would like to thank Ingrid Woolard, J.

I show that the curse always exists if political agents are rent-seeking, since mechanisms of government accountability, e.g. electoral competition, the presence of political challengers, and even the threat of violent conflict, are inherently imperfect. However, the scope for rent-seeking becomes more limited as the competition over political power that threatens the incumbent government becomes more intense.","[Desierto, Desiree A.] Stanford Univ, WSD Handa Ctr Human Rights & Int Justice, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Desierto, Desiree A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Stanford University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Desierto, D (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, WSD Handa Ctr Human Rights & Int Justice, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Desierto, D (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",desierto@wisc.edu,,,,,,,32,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

To identify what impedes further reductions in this gap, we used Japanese data to conduct a decomposition across the wage distribution, focusing on the wage structure effect, which is the portion of the gender wage gap that is unexplained by gendered differences in human capital. We show that the wage structure effect is larger within an establishment than between establishments and at the tails of the wage distribution than in the middle, indicating that both a glass ceiling and a sticky floor exist within establishments and have for more than 25 years. The sticky floor appears to be largely caused by Japan's gendered career track job segregation system and the glass ceiling by a gender promotion gap and a swimming upstream phenomenon. Consequently, any further reduction in the gender wage gap will require a resolution of gender job segregation and a shift towards jobs that reward flexibility.","[Hara, Hiromi] Japan Womens Univ, Fac Human Sci & Design, Dept Social & Family Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 2-8-1 Mejirodai, Tokyo 1128681, Japan",Japan Womens University,"Hara, H (通讯作者)，Japan Womens Univ, Fac Human Sci & Design, Dept Social & Family Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 2-8-1 Mejirodai, Tokyo 1128681, Japan.",harahiromi@fc.jwu.ac.jp,,"Hara, Hiromi/0000-0001-6027-0844","Japan Center for Economic Research; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K03711]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research) [15KK0097]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03711, 15KK0097] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Center for Economic Research; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to express my appreciation to two anonymous referees, and the following people for their helpful comments: Izumi Yokoyama, Patrik Kline, Ayako Kondo, Keisuke Kawata, Hideo Owan, Takahiro Itoh, Machiko Osawa, Edward Lazear, Todd Sorensen, David Neumark, Ami Glazer, Damon Clerk, Micael Castanheira, and Daiji Kawaguchi.

Regional economic integration not only stimulates labour mobility, but also achieve scale economy, both of which may also influence carbon dioxide (CO2) marginal abatement costs through affecting energy consumption, CO2 emissions, productivity growth, and technical progress. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has currently concerned the influence of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement costs. To fill this research gap, this study first theoretically clarifies the influence mechanism of regional economic integration on CO2 marginal abatement cost, and then empirically attempts to investigate their relationship in the context of China, with panel data models. To serve this purpose, the provincial CO2 marginal abatement cost and regional economic integration are estimated by parametric directional distance function and price-based approach, respectively. The results show that China's regional economic integration level indeed gradually improved over 2002-2011 except in 2003-04 and 2006-09 due to the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the sub-prime loan crisis. Moreover, evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO2 marginal abatement cost at 5% significance level. Using robust tests, it can be found that the results are also reliable and robust to sub-samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the factors driving cash demand and its denomination structure are vital for the smooth functioning of the economy. We pursue an analytical framework which allows to model the demand for each denomination individually as well as to capture the interactions between them, both over the short- and long-run. The approach builds on the DSUR estimator for the long-run relationships coupled with a SUR ECM for modelling the short-run dynamics. The focus is on a small open economy within the euro area monetary union. Such a context adds dimensions which go beyond the traditional drivers considered in the previous literature. In particular, the importance of currency migration through tourism flows is highlighted. Furthermore, the interconnections between demand for different denominations are found to be quite significant and the heterogeneous role of the determinants across denominations is documented.","[Rua, Antonio] Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, NOVA Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Banco de Portugal,"Rua, A (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Econ & Res Dept, NOVA Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",antonio.rua@bportugal.pt,,"Rua, Antonio/0000-0003-2494-9758",,,,,45,6,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Positive public storage relaxes future participation constraints, hence it can improve risk sharing, contrary to the case where hidden income or effort is the deep friction. The characteristics of constrained-efficient allocations crucially depend on the storage technology's return. At the steady state, if the return on storage is (i) moderately high, both assets and the consumption distribution may remain time-varying; (ii) sufficiently high, assets converge almost surely to a constant and the consumption distribution is time-invariant; (iii) equal to agents' discount rate, perfect risk sharing is self-enforcing. Agents never have an incentive to use their private storage technology, i.e. Euler inequalities are always satisfied, at the constrained-efficient allocation of our model, while this is not the case without optimal public asset accumulation. Finally, we find that, in contrast with the limited-commitment model without storage, past income affects consumption growth negatively both in our model with storage and in data from Indian villages.","[Abraham, Arpad] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Laczo, Sarolta] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",European University Institute; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Abrahám, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.",,,,JAE-Doc grant - European Social Fund; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [612796],JAE-Doc grant - European Social Fund; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)(European Union (EU)),"We thank two editors, four anonymous referees, Andy Atkeson, Piero Gottardi, Hugo Hopenhayn, Yang K.

Nevertheless, the multiplicity of equilibria shows that coordination failure might emerge, generating a social welfare loss.

Using the method of undetermined coefficients, I solve for the price level and the nominal exchange rate to determine how price shocks from the large economy affect the small open economy. The results show that the behaviour of inflation transmission within the band differs from the behavior of inflation transmission at the edge of the band of the target zone. Foreign shocks can affect local prices in both cases but the central bank can respond through market interventions within the band while it cannot do so at the edge. Near the edge of the band, a central bank has to intervene to stop the exchange rate from breaching the band. My model predicts that if the interventions are robust, then the exchange rate is mean reverting and an exchange rate target zone can insulate an economy from foreign price shocks. Based on the model, central bank interventions contribute to long-run price stability in a target zone regime. Finally, I empirically test the model using unit root and cointegration tests, and present some policy implications.","[Chua, Kevin C.] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Shanda Nanlu 27, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Chua, KC (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Shanda Nanlu 27, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",kchua@sdu.edu.cn,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

For example, the behavior of a pedestrian who wants to cross the street depends on whether or not he believes that the driver of an oncoming car has seen him or not. People can also reason about the theory of mind abilities of others, leading to recursive thinking of the sort 'I think that you think that I think.'. Previous research suggests that this ability may be especially effective in simple competitive settings. In this paper, we use a combination of computational agents and Bayesian model selection to determine to what extent people make use of higher-order theory of mind reasoning in a particular competitive game known as matching pennies. We find that while many children and adults appear to make use of theory of mind, participants are also often classified as using a simpler reactive strategy based only on the actions of the directly preceding round. This may indicate that human reasoners do not primarily use their theory of mind abilities to compete with others.","[de Weerd, Harmen; Diepgrond, Denny; Verbrugge, Rineke] Univ Groningen, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"de Weerd, H (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Groningen, Netherlands.",hdeweerd@gmail.com,"Verbrugge, Rineke/D-3781-2012; de Weerd, Harmen/J-9255-2012","Verbrugge, Rineke/0000-0003-3829-0106; de Weerd, Harmen/0000-0002-9076-0606",,,,,50,4,5,4,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6124,1935-1704,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

This contradicts the presumption that evasion is the main source of non-compliance for deductions, and that the use of information reporting raises revenue collections. A pre-reform randomized audit experiment did not detect the unclaimed deductions, implying audits overstate evasion relative to extensive-margin underreporting.

The study reviews the main approaches to the economic assessment of the Games, from the point of view of the underlying economic concepts and methodologies, as well as of the empirical results obtained. It focuses on the effects that are measured and on those, which even though important, are generally neglected. The methodologies utilized for the quantitative assessments of the Games are reviewed with special emphasis on impact and cost-benefit analysis, both on ex ante and ex post basis. The studies surveyed are analysed from the point of view of different sets of effects on the host city, and for a limited number of cases, on the host country. While the major focus is on hosting the Summer Olympics, some attention is also paid to the bidding cities, the Winter Olympics and the Paralympics. The general findings appear to be controversial with some hints of positive overall effects, but also with a well-documented tendency to exaggerate the benefits and underestimate the costs of holding the Games in the ex ante versus the ex post studies.

The results of our experimental study have shown that, according to the M.A. students in accounting, the risk aversion of individuals influences the expressions of the creative accounting phenomenon, but it is not correlated with the interest pursued by the managers in choosing accounting policies. Also, in their perception, the act of managerial decision-making in accounting is not influenced by the individual capacities of the decision-maker to take decisions.

The new approach outperforms the classical single-regime framework, by detecting different dynamics of spillovers during periods of crisis and periods of tranquility. Moreover, the proposed estimation method has the advantage over existing procedures to converge remarkably fast when applied to a large number of variables. Empirical investigation on volatility indices of eight developed financial stock markets shows that the total and directional spillovers are more intense during turbulent periods, with frequent swings between net risk transmission and net risk reception. Conversely, during periods of tranquility, volatility spillovers are relatively moderate.","[BenSaida, Ahmed; Litimi, Houda] Univ Sousse, LaREMFiQ Lab, HEC Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia; [Abdallah, Oussama] Univ Rennes, LiRIS Lab, EA 7481, Rennes, France",Universite de Sousse; Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite de Rennes,"BenSaïda, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sousse, LaREMFiQ Lab, HEC Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia.",ahmedbensaida@yahoo.com; houda.litimi@gmail.com; oussama.abdallah@univ-rennes2.fr,"BenSaïda, Ahmed/C-4871-2013","BenSaïda, Ahmed/0000-0001-5591-4393; Litimi, Houda/0000-0002-4385-7528",,,,,38,59,61,2,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Their boundaries are hard to pin down and intrinsically fuzzy. Nevertheless, policymakers often speak or act as if their definition was self-evident. The Dutch and later the British governments, for example, introduced very specific policies for them without ever clearly defining what or where they were. In this article, we propose a simple methodology to predict TC boundaries and extent. Using a range of micro-geographical data, we test our method for the whole of Great Britain in an attempt to capture all the dimensions of 'town centredness' in a 3D surface. We believe this is a contribution in its own right but is also an essential step if there is to be any rigorous analysis of TC or evaluation of policies directed at them. Our method should contribute to improve not just debates about cities, shopping hierarchies, and TCs but also to other more general debates where people and policy proceed ahead of any clear definition of what are the objects of interest.","[Cheshire, Paul; Hilber, Christian] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, London, England; [Cheshire, Paul; Hilber, Christian] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr SERC CEP, London, England; [Montebruno, Piero] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa] Imperial Coll Business Sch, London, England; [Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa] London Sch Econ, SERC CEP, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cambridge; Imperial College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Cheshire, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, London, England.;Cheshire, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr SERC CEP, London, England.",p.cheshire@lse.ac.uk; c.hilber@lse.ac.uk; pfm27@cam.ac.uk; r.sanchis-guarner@imperial.ac.uk,"Montebruno, Piero/M-9796-2018; Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa/Z-5057-2019","Montebruno, Piero/0000-0001-8010-7446; Sanchis-Guarner, Rosa/0000-0003-2744-0551; Hilber, Christian/0000-0002-1352-495X",SERC/CEP [ES/M010341/1]; British Academy; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,SERC/CEP; British Academy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank SERC/CEP for funding (ESRC grant ES/M010341/1), and R.S.-G. acknowledges support from the British Academy.

We begin by showing that the use of oil prices as a proxy for more general energy price dynamics is not appropriate for the case of China. Having established this fact, we propose a new energy price index which accurately reflects the structure of China's energy expenditure shares, and intertemporal fluctuations in international energy prices. We then employ a sufficiently rich set of time varying VARs, identified through a new set of agnostic sign restrictions, to estimate the effects of energy price shocks on China's macroeconomy. Our main result is that positive energy price shocks generate statistically significant reductions in real GDP growth and increases in inflation. Interestingly, both the sets of responses have consistently declined over the sample period. Next, the interest rate responses are found to be consistently positive over the sample period. Given the aforementioned stagflation result, this suggests that the PBOC is more focused on inflation stabilization as compared to facilitating output growth. All presented results are shown to be robust under both official national data and those developed by Chang et al. (2015), thus strengthening our conclusion that energy price shocks have significant time varying effects on China's macroeconomy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We construct our measure of the intensity of the protests the district-level number of martyrs and rely on a Difference-in-Differences approach. We find that the 2011 protests have reduced intra-household differences in labor force participation by increasing women's employment and unemployment relative to men. Women's employment relative to men increased in both the private and informal sectors. Our estimates suggest how economic uncertainty such as the one associated to the recent protests may undermine the importance of cultural factors and attitudes towards female work.

It is not readily obvious whether this disparity is due to prejudice on the part of decisionmakers or due to applicant differences in meeting naturalization standards. To address this question, I develop a simple model of a council deciding whether to grant applicants citizenship. The model implies an empirical test for prejudice using average applicant group rejection rates. Using Switzerland as a case study, I apply the test to newly collected data from six large municipalities. In five municipalities, the test cannot reject the hypothesis of no prejudice with respect to country of origin. The rejection pattern of the sixth municipality is consistent with prejudice. The model illustrates some general points about the underlying mechanism in the decisionmaking process which have bearing on the inference of prejudice in naturalizations from observational data.

The sources of such growth were balanced among labor market demographic factors, capital investment, human capital accumulation, and productivity growth. However, the main engine of growth evolved sequentially, e.g., labor and human capital factors in the 1960s, capital deepening in the 1970s, and then productivity growth for the following periods. We found that major sources of the six-decade sustained growth were productivity growth and human capital accumulation rather than the expansion of labor force or capital investment. Counterfactual analysis of neoclassical growth model reveals that the accelerated productivity growth after the fast capital deepening was the key to Korea's long-term growth, avoiding the middle-income trap. Appropriate calibration of the neoclassical growth model allowing time-varying transitional growth parameters explains Korea's growth experience well and provides useful lessons for sustainable development policy.","[Jeong, Hyeok] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Jeong, H (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Gwanak Ro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",hyeokj@gmail.com,,,World Bank Group; Korea Development Institute [7179114],World Bank Group; Korea Development Institute,"This work was supported by the Global Facility on Growth for Development project between the World Bank Group and Korea Development Institute [PO #7179114].

First, by using a multiple-threshold model, we find that monetary authorities in China and the US have obvious asymmetric preferences at different stages of business cycle. Nominal interest rate adjustments are more likely to be used to curb inflation during expansion and to stimulate output growth during contraction. Second, we re-examine monetary policy rules in the two countries by using a LT-TVP-VAR model within the New Keynesian rational expectation framework. We find that nominal interest rate adjustments are significantly gradual and barely regime-switching. Finally, we also provide empirical evidence that the federal funds rate, despite remaining near zero, can stabilize output and inflation during the post-recession period. As output growth and inflation continue to follow a downward trend, China is likely to enter a period of low interest rates.","[Liu, Dayu; Xu, Ning] Jilin Univ, Quantitat Econ Ctr, 2699 Qianjin St, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Tingting] Stat Dept British Columbia, 2207 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Song, Yang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Xu, N (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Room 3059,Bldg Kuang Yaming,2699 Qianjin St, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.",liuyuchris@163.com; 277708402@qq.com,"yang, zhuo/JPK-3133-2023; li, xinke/JTU-3633-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023",,,,,,33,11,11,4,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In Switzerland, the average hiring costs amount to about 16 weeks of wage payments. The main components of hiring costs are post-match hiring costs, resulting from the initial low productivity and formal training needed for a new hire (53%), and disruption costs, resulting from the informal instruction of a new hire (26%). Pre-match hiring costs (i.e., search costs) account for just 21% of a firm's hiring costs. Moreover, we find that search costs are positively associated with labor market tightness (i.e., the v/u ratio), both in the cross-section and over time.

Panel quantile regression is used to examine the effects at different intervals throughout the distribution of health outcomes. The estimation results indicate that democracy has significant positive effects on health outcomes and that its impacts are greater when health outcomes are worse. These results are robust to different democracy and health indices. The effects of different types of democracies and dictatorships are also considered, that is parliamentary, mixed (semi-presidential) and presidential democracies, and civilian, military and royal dictatorships. The parliamentary form of democracy has the largest positive impact on health outcomes at the worst quantile of health outcomes, although the difference in the impacts of the three types of democracies is not necessarily large. Furthermore, all types of dictatorships have a negative impact on health outcomes, with military dictatorship having the worst outcome when health outcomes are worse.

This paper investigates whether the announcement of a WTO dispute resolution case has the power to fundamentally change market dynamics. We find empirical support for this notion because REE prices exhibit a structural break around the announcement of the WTO dispute, and show lower variance ratios for all tested REEs afterward. This indicates a tendency toward efficiency, although REE prices still do not follow a random walk. Similarly, we find that stock price informativeness of companies in the REE industry increases after the announcement, reflecting more firm-specific than marketwide information and less governmental influence. Finally, we show that model uncertainty for option pricing models decreases, which we measure by the lower pricing differences among them. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the methodology to assess the impacts and values of investing in road infrastructure are outlined, together with a case study application to Queensland's Capricorn Coast. This tourism area is bypassed to the east of the main coastal highway and is accessible only through a regional highway city. The economic benefits of a northern access road to encourage tourism at the coast have been assessed. This study demonstrates how to conduct economic analyses before investing resources into new tourist access roads. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from firms in Vietnam,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Entrepreneurship; SMEs; Firm performance; Personality; Risk attitudes; Vietnam,INDIVIDUAL RISK ATTITUDES; BUSINESS; LOCUS; IMPACT; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; BIASES; WAGES; CEOS,"Using novel data from micro, small and medium firms in Vietnam, we estimate the relationship between behavioural and personality traits of owners/managers - risk attitudes, locus of control, and innovativeness - and firm-level decisions. We extend the analysis beyond standard metrics of firm performance such as revenue and growth to study intermediate investments, including product innovation, worker training, and adoption of work-place safety measures that are potentially conducive to observed firm performance. Our results show that innovativeness and locus of control are positively correlated with revenue while risk aversion predicts lower revenue. Risk aversion is positively correlated with the adoption of safety measures. Innovativeness, as expected, is associated with an increased probability of product innovations. An internal locus of control predicts higher probability of investments, innovations and worker training. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that innovativeness and risk aversion matter more for firm outcomes in provinces characterized by better business climate. Our results are robust to a variety of checks. We contribute to a nascent and rapidly growing literature on the importance of managerial capital by shedding light on the role of managerial personality characteristics for decision-making in firms in a dynamic transition economy.

For distributions of output that are commonly used in the literature, the high interest rate equilibria have properties that make them fragile.

Applying recent asymmetry error-correction modeling and asymmetry cointegration of Shin et al.

To do so, the cubic polynomial functional form of EKC is utilized by accommodating renewable energy into the base of the EKC model and validating its hypothesis between CO2 emissions and GDP growth for the 1971-2015 period. The F-bounds, VECM Granger causality, CUSUM, and CUSUMSQ tests are utilized. The estimated results consistently show that the inverted N-shaped EKC hypothesis holds in Malaysia. Ceteris paribus, the CO2 emissions will be declined when the GDP reach RM284 1.9 billion in 2030, which is beyond the sample period. The renewable energy has a negative significant effect on CO2 emissions, and the direction of causality is running from CO2 emissions to renewable energy. Also, the GDP growth will be the remedy for environmental pollution problems and that renewable energy is one of important elements to be considered for improving environmental quality. A tighter and concentrated environmental policy is needed to direct the environment-economic growth nexus toward a downward trend. Consequently, these results may help Malaysian policymakers to establish an energy policy that guarantees a balance between economic growth and environmental prosperity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using daily S&P 500 index returns, model confidence set estimations provide strong evidence that the most important model feature is the non-affinity of the variance process. Despite testing alternative specifications during the turbulent market regime of the global financial crisis of 2008, we find no evidence that either finite- or infinite-activity jump models or other previously proposed model extensions improve the out-of-sample performance further. Applications to Value-at-Risk demonstrate the economic significance of our results. Furthermore, the out-of-sample results suggest that standard jump diffusion models are misspecified.

In this paper, we attempt to address some of these shortcomings by being very explicit about what measures are construed as capital controls. Also, given that success is measured so differently across studies, we sought to standardize the results of the close to 40 empirical studies we summarize in this paper. The standardization was done by constructing two indices of capital controls: Capital Controls Effectiveness Index (CCE Index), and Weighted Capital Controls Effectiveness Index (WCCE Index). The difference between them lies in that the WCCE controls for the differentiated degree of methodological rigor applied in each of the considered papers. Inasmuch as possible, we bring to bear the experiences of less well-known episodes than those of Chile and Malaysia, and the more recent controls on outflows in emerging Europe. We find that only under country-specific characteristics are capital controls effective, implying that, more often than not, in practice they do not work. We also show that the equivalence in effects of price vs. quantity capital controls is conditional on the level of short-term capital flows.","[Magud, Nicolas E.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Reinhart, Carmen M.; Rogoff, Kenneth S.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Reinhart, Carmen M.; Rogoff, Kenneth S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",International Monetary Fund; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Magud, NE (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,"Rogoff, Kenneth/G-1894-2018; Magud, Nicolas/AAW-5912-2020","Magud, Nicolas/0000-0001-6274-7650",,,,,54,37,42,0,7,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

J,"Riedel, J",,,,"Riedel, James",,,The costs and benefits of exchange rate protection in China,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LABOR-MARKET; TRADE; GROWTH; WAGES,"From 2002 to 2011, China ran large surpluses in both the current and capital accounts of its balance of payments, which the People's Bank of China (PBOC) purchased and held at official foreign reserves to avoid nominal appreciation of the currency. Concurrently, with its massive purchases of foreign exchange, the PBOC compelled commercial banks to buy PBOC sterilisation bonds' and raised commercial bank reserve requirement ratios to avoid monetisation of its foreign exchange purchases and concomitant upward pressure on the price level (that is, real appreciation of the currency). Sterilising foreign exchange intervention, as China did for a decade, constitutes a violation of the implicit rules of a fixed exchange rate regime and as such can be seen as a mercantilist policy of manipulating the real exchange rate to gain, or avoid losing, international price competitivenesswhat Corden (1981) termed exchange rate protection'. This paper sets out the simple theory of the costs and benefits of exchange rate protection and provides back-of-the-envelope estimates of their magnitude in China in the 2000s. It also explores the other side of the story', the decline in US manufacturing employment in the 2000s, which recent literature attributes to a China Trade Shock' that allegedly resulted from the US granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China in 2001. Here, it is argued that the so-called China Trade Shock resulted from China's sterilised intervention policy, not the granting of PNTR. The implications of these competing hypotheses are considered in the conclusions.","[Riedel, James] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Riedel, J (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jriedel@jhu.edu,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

It is critical to uncover energy-saving responsibilities associated with regional HIEC for China to respond climate change. In this study, we investigated the HIEC of Guangdong Province in 2012 from a sectoral perspective, using environmentally extended input-output analysis. Structural path analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to assess the key paths of the different production layers (PLs) for total, urban, and rural HIEC. Our results show that: (1) there are significant differences between urban and rural HIEC. (2) The Electricity and Steam Production and Supply, Transport, Storage, Postal and Telecommunication Services, and Residential Services sectors are the main drivers of both urban and rural HIEC. Furthermore, sectors with large hidden energy-saving responsibilities deserve more attentions. (3) Urban HIEC is more complicated than rural HIEC, and the first four PLs (PL0 PL1, PL2 and PL3), especially PL0 are the most important contributors to HIEC. (4) For PL0 only 11, 11 and 9 paths result in significant energy-saving for total, urban and rural HIEC, respectively. (5) Energy management for high-order PLs is sector-dependent and should consider the formation, length, and magnitude of the key paths. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Explorative qualitative cause and effect modeling could serve as an approach for considering crucial factors to better understand the interrelations among the SDGs, eventually leading to more informed concrete measures that are able to cope with the SDG's inherent obstacles. This work describes a model that could serve as a template for concrete application. The generalized model already points to some potential trade-offs. Its first analysis cautiously raises doubts that some possible assumptions behind the SDGs might overlook systemic boundaries. For example, an undifferentiated increase of productivity contradicts a lessened environmental impact and need for resources in light of potential planetary boundaries.

The post-Bretton Woods greater financial integration and under-regulated financial intermediation have increased the cost of sustaining a currency area and other forms of fixed exchange-rate regimes. Financial crises illustrated that fast-moving asymmetric financial shocks interacting with real distortions pose a grave threat to the stability of currency areas and fixed exchange-rate regimes. Members of a currency union with closer financial links may accumulate asymmetric balance-sheet exposure over time, becoming more susceptible to sudden-stop crises. In a phase of deepening financial ties, countries may end up with more correlated business cycles. Down the road, debtor countries that rely on financial inflows to fund structural imbalances may be exposed to devastating sudden-stop crises, subsequently reducing the correlation of business cycles between currency area's members, possibly ceasing the gains from membership in a currency union. A currency union of developing countries anchored to a leading global currency stabilizes inflation at a cost of inhibiting the use of monetary policy to deal with real and financial shocks. Currency unions with low financial depth and low financial integration of its members may be more stable at a cost of inhibiting the growth of sectors depending on bank funding.","[Aizenman, Joshua] USC, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] NBER, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，USC, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",aizenman@usc.edu,,,,,,,18,8,9,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This paper presents causal evidence on the impact of work search requirements on single parents' transitions into work and onto other benefits. We use rich administrative data on all single parent welfare recipients, and apply a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the staggered roll-out of a reform in the UK that gradually decreased the age of the youngest child at which single parents lose the right to an unconditional cash benefit. Consistent with the predictions of a simple search model, the work search requirements have heterogeneous impacts, leading some single parents to move into work, but leading some (especially those with weak previous labour market attachments) to move onto disability benefits (with no search conditionalities) or non-claimant unemployment.

Our reference specification is the partial linear model y(t) = f (t) + z(t)beta + epsilon(t) where macroeconomic variables z enter parametrically, and f is nonparametric, to be discovered using cross-validation. We analyze data on 11 commodities-3 hydrocarbons and 8 metals.

The Food Stamp program is one of the largest safety net programs today, and my analysis provides one of the first quasi-experimental estimates of the effects of the modern Food Stamp program on adult labor supply. I find strong evidence of labor supply disincentives, and the magnitude and margin of this response varies across demographic groups. Access to the program reduces the employment rates of single women by about 6%, whereas married men continue to work but reduce their hours of work by 5%.

However, an increase in the degree of bank diversification within non-traditional bank activities leads to an increase in bank liquidity creation. In the context of China's banking sector, the positive and negative aspects of bank diversification coexist. In addition, we do not find evidence of reverse causality between banks' diversification and liquidity creation.

I show that this problem has a strong parallel to Weitzman's (1974) classic model of using price or quantity controls to regulate an externality. Changes in fuel prices act as shocks to the marginal cost of complying with the standard. Assuming constant marginal damages from fuel consumption, an application of Weitzman (1974) implies that a fixed fuel economy standard reduces expected welfare relative to a price policy such as a feebate or, equivalently, a fuel economy standard that is indexed to the price of gasoline. When the regulator is constrained to use a fixed standard, I show that the usual approach to setting the standard equate expected marginal compliance cost to marginal damage is likely to be sub-optimal because the standard may not bind if the realized gasoline price is sufficiently high. Instead, the optimal fixed standard will be relatively relaxed and may be non-binding even at the expected gasoline price. Finally, I show that although an attribute-based standard allows vehicle choices to flexibly respond to gasoline price shocks, the resulting distortions imply that the optimal fuel economy standard is not attribute-based.","[Kellogg, Ryan] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kellogg, Ryan] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kellogg, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",kelloggr@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,43,8,11,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

The evidence further indicates that continuous engagement in internationalization activities is associated with higher growth than intermittent engagement.

However, the post-recession sharp decline in inflation in 2012 was not anticipated by most observers. This paper seeks to explain this behavior of eurozone core inflation, which we do by estimating a Phillips curve with professional forecasters' inflation expectations. Doing so produces inflation predictions that closely match the observed behavior of core inflation, whereas lagged expectations fail to predict the 2012 disinflation. Furthermore, we find that short-term inflation expectations are most relevant for the euro area, rather than longer-term ones. Indeed the evidence suggests that the ECB's inflation anchor of 2% has weakened since the Great Recession, and is something that should cause policymakers a lot of concern.","[Mazumder, Sandeep] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",mazumds@wfu.edu,,,,,,,51,9,10,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Juglar was not a theoretician of colonialism, but a liberal economist who rejected the process of colonization on economic grounds. This paper provides evidence that conventional wisdom on French colonialism is indebted to his work. The issues of capital returns in the colonies, French colonialism as mercantilism and protectionism, and the role of colonial institutions in economic development were all addressed by Juglar. He identified property rights and colonial institutions as central issues in his explanation of the predictable failure of colonialism, and in doing so he can be regarded as a forerunner of neo-institutionalist analysis of colonialism.","[Parent, Antoine] Sci Po Lyon, Lyon, France; [Parent, Antoine] Univ Lyon, Inst Sci Homme, Lyon, France; [Parent, Antoine] LAET Inst Rhonalpin Syst Complexes, CAC, Lyon, France; [Butler, Robert] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Econ, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Parent, A (通讯作者)，Sci Po Lyon, Lyon, France.;Parent, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, Inst Sci Homme, Lyon, France.;Parent, A (通讯作者)，LAET Inst Rhonalpin Syst Complexes, CAC, Lyon, France.",antoine.parent@sciencespo-lyon.fr; r.butler@ucc.ie,"Butler, Robert/HKN-2882-2023","Butler, Robert/0000-0001-7868-0606; PARENT, Antoine/0000-0001-5087-9488",,,,,34,2,2,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The younger workers in the sample drive this result, trading 25% of their wages to join teams with an expected productivity one standard deviation higher. This investment can be recouped if a reasonable increase in human capital occurs. These results are robust to contract length-wage simultaneity and indicate that investment in human capital motivates the observed tradeoff, suggesting a new pathway through which human capital accumulation can affect wages.

Considering the importance of regime shifts or structural breaks in econometric analysis, this study employs the Carrion-i-Silvestre, Kim, and Perron unit root tests and the Maki cointegration tests, allowing for multiple breaks. Cointegration results confirm the existence of long-run equilibrium relationships between these stock indices, crude oil prices, short-term interest rates and the S&P 500. These findings indicate that crude oil prices and the other explanatory variables are long-run determinants of the stock prices of oil, technology and transportation firms. Stock prices of oil companies are positively affected by crude oil prices to a greater degree than that of technology and transportation stocks. Time-varying causality results show that West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) is relatively more likely to affect the stock prices of these companies rather than to be affected by them. Evidently, it is confirmed that financial crises have a substantial ability to intensify the causal linkages between WTI and the stock indices of these companies.","[Shaeri, Komeil; Katircioglu, Salih] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Katircioglu, S (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Turkey.",salihk@emu.edu.tr,"Katircioglu, Salih T./H-3494-2016",,,,,,54,30,30,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In particular, it investigates the impact of a company's announcements of the application for, withdrawal, rejection, approval and completion of private equity placement, while examining the cross-sectional differences of the market performance of their industry counterparts, both in the short- and long-term. It was found that an intra-industry reaction exists; competitors experience a decrease in stock prices in response to the announcement of the application for, approval and completion of private equity placement and an increase in stock prices around the announcement of the withdrawal or rejection of applications. Further, it was found that competitors experience a decrease in their long-term stock performance following private placements. A higher discount on private equity placement is detrimental for private equity (P.E.) issuing companies in the long-term. This study, therefore, provides evidence of the existence of a contagion effect in the long-term while a competitive effect dominates in the short-term.","[Fonseka, M.

This paper reviews the impact of this evolution on energy firms' investments. First, we survey the existing evidence on the effects of the presence of independent regulatory agencies on utilities' investment rates in Europe in the MENA countries, and in Latin America, focussing on the role of de facto independence and the institutional framework. Second, we discuss the impact of incentive- versus rate-of-return regulation on firms' incentives to invest and the interaction with firm private/public ownership. In this regard, we provide new econometric evidence of the recent developments of regulation, using a sample of European energy utilities tracked from 1997 to 2013. Our results confirm previous findings that investment is higher under incentive regulation than under rate of return regulation. However, differently from the earlier results, we find that investments seem to be driven more by the weighted average cost of capital than by the X-factor. The paper concludes reviewing recent evidence on service quality regulation on firm investment specifically on the impact of reward/penalty schemes on capital and operational expenditures.","[Abrardi, Laura; Carlo, Cambini; Laura, Rondi] Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Carlo, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Turin, Italy.",laura.abrardi@polito.it; carlo.cambini@polito.it; laura.rondi@polito.it,"Rondi, Laura/ADS-4154-2022; Abrardi, Laura/AAT-3408-2020","Abrardi, Laura/0000-0002-3910-7097; CAMBINI, CARLO/0000-0002-7471-8133; RONDI, Laura/0000-0002-7683-1164",,,,,52,2,2,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2018,166.0,1,,,SI,,41,62,,10.1007/s10645-017-9310-y,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,FV8YD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424872700004,0

It also elaborates on other key factors contributing to SME manufacturing firm export activity. The empirical results presented confirm that the Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Bank) and the Department of International Trade Promotion (DITP) both play a significant role in enhancing Thai SME and all manufacturing firm export participation and export intensity. Local and foreign commercial banks, however, are not found to have a significant correlation with their export participation and export intensity. In addition, SMEs and all manufacturing firms receiving funds from friends and family are found to participate less in foreign markets compared to those SMEs and all manufacturing firms in aggregate which do not receive any funds from their friends and family. With respect to the importance of type of ownership for export activity, foreign ownership can help promote the export participation and intensity of Thai manufacturing SMEs and all manufacturing enterprises. Technological innovation activity also helps them to participate in foreign markets. The empirical evidence also points out that financial institutions in Thailand remain reliant on collateral-based lending and financial transparency. A key finding from this paper is that manufacturing SMEs are likely to perform worse in terms of export participation, export intensity, and access to finance compared to large manufacturing enterprises.","[Amornkitvikai, Yot] Rangsit Univ, Fac Econ, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Harvie, Charles] Univ Wollongong, Fac Business, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",Rangsit University; University of Wollongong,"Amornkitvikai, Y (通讯作者)，Rangsit Univ, Fac Econ, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",yot.a@rsu.ac.th; charvie@uow.edu.au,,"Amornkitvikai, Yot/0000-0001-9273-5108",,,,,41,6,7,1,37,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Using a search and matching model with endogenous separations, we show that investments in match-specific human capital reduce incentives to separate but leave the job finding rate essentially unaffected.

Nonetheless, the desirability of some form of price-level targeting, inducing inertia in interest-rate policy, paramount under rational expectations, is robust to the assumption of imperfect knowledge.","[Eusepi, Stefano] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; [Preston, Bruce] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of Melbourne,"Eusepi, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",,,,Australian Research Council [FT130101599]; Australian Research Council [FT130101599] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank Jim Bullard, Marc Giannoni, and Mike Woodford for ongoing discussions about much of the material contained herein, and also a number of anonymous referees and the editors Janet Currie and Steven Durlauf for constructive feedback.

We further investigate empirically the mechanisms underlying this trade liberalization effect, and find that input tariff reductions decrease marginal costs, and their effects on markup adjustments are more profound among firms with higher import dependence. Moreover, we exploit unique features of Chinese data by comparing results for two trade regimes: ordinary trade (wherein firms pay import tariffs to import) and processing trade (wherein firms are not subject to import tariffs). While the aforementioned trade liberalization effects and mechanisms only apply to ordinary trade, processing trade samples are used in a placebo test. The paper also shows that more productive firms charge higher markups for products. All these findings are robust to alternative markup measures including one estimate using physical-quantity output data, different production function specifications, a subsample consisting only of pure exporters, and estimations based on our theoretical derivations.

Local pricing may contribute to enable a smart behaviour of grid users by providing appropriate incentives. In this paper, we apply a local pricing algorithm on distribution grid level. We analyse its effects for a typical German rural low voltage grid with high penetration of photovoltaics and heat pumps. With households using electric heat pumps, a potentially flexible consumer type is implemented in detail. Such setup is used to assess two issues: Firstly, the exploited potential in terms of avoided curtailment and, secondly, redistributive effects of such local pricing mechanism under use of different stylized policy choices. Results show that - even with given local incentives - the consumption adjustment towards an efficient grid usage can frequently not be realized since complementarity of photovoltaics and space heating demand is limited and technical constraints do not allow to overcome this gap. Furthermore, we show that - despite limited merits in terms of system costs the redistributive effects of local pricing mechanisms are very significant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use these data to estimate learning types using finite mixture models. Monitoring information requests turns out to be crucial, as estimates based on choices alone show substantial biases. We also find that learning depends on network position.

Besides, the empirical findings reveal that workers who are paid on the piece rates exert more effort and earn more than those workers paid an hourly salary. Since the possible effects of performance paying jobs on the well-being of workers stay hidden, we have tackled the following issue by providing the effects that the performance pay job schemes have on job satisfaction. We have used the Korean Labour and Income Panel Survey which allowed us to distinguish between the workers who are paid by performance and those who are paid by fixed rate. We have shown that workers in the performance pay job schemes have a higher subjective well-being on the job than workers who are using the non-performance pay job schemes. The following result holds true even after we have controlled for the level of earnings, attitudes towards risk, and other personal and job-related characteristics. Finally, we have exploited the information on the type of performance pay schemes to analyse how different performance pay schemes affect job satisfaction. The results have shown that workers who are employed on either individual or group or company performance pay job schemes are more satisfied on their job than workers who are paid by the fixed amount.

We conduct an out-of-sample test to the link between these two anomalies recurring to a sample of Portuguese stocks during the period 1988-2015. We find that the momentum of value and growth stocks is significantly different: growth stocks exhibit a much larger momentum than value stocks. A combined value and momentum strategy can generate statistically significant excess annual returns of 10.8%. These findings persist across several holding periods up to a year. Moreover, we show that macroeconomic variables fail to explain value and momentum of individual and combined returns.

This paper revisits the question using non-linear threshold cointegration methods. It examines how a shock to oil prices affects gold prices, with the impacts shown to depend on both the size of the shock and the region within which the system lies when the shock occurs. This simple, yet novel result helps to explain why earlier studies found conflicting evidence on whether gold and crude prices share a long-run relationship. The empirical findings also suggest that energy policies should not be designed without consideration for their interaction with financial policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The risk premia are measured using survey data on traders' exchange rate forecasts. This circumvents the need for an auxiliary hypothesis of rationality and enables more direct focus on risk behavior. The analysis is conducted using the I(2) cointegrated VAR, which allows for time-varying trends in the variables. Evidence of persistent changes is found for interest rates, prices, and nominal and real exchange rates.

This study attempts to assess the impact of these endeavours by going beyond calculations of lumpsum effects on consumer surplus. We revise the simulation of Van Sinderen and Kemp (Economist 156(4):365-385, 2008) who use a cut in income taxes as a modelling device to simulate the impact of anti cartel policies. Our approach avoids attributing effects caused purely by changes in taxation to market power and uses changes in the Lerner index as the impuls. We have updated the model to enable simulating the impact of competition policies on productivity and R&D in order to get a balanced view on the effects. We find that the re-distribution of surplus from producers to consumers supported by ACM in this new setting is likely to have a positive effect on productivity, GDP, wages and consumption, and a small positive effect on employment. This differs from the outcome of Van Sinderen and Kemp, who did not find a positive impact on productivity, due to an overestimation of the employment growth.","[Svitak, Jan; van Sinderen, Jarig] Netherlands Author Consumers & Markets ACM, Postbus 16326, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands; [van Sinderen, Jarig] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Sviták, J (通讯作者)，Netherlands Author Consumers & Markets ACM, Postbus 16326, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands.",Jan.Svitak@acm.nl; Jarig.van.Sinderen@acm.nl,,"Svitak, Jan/0000-0003-4826-2475",,,,,42,1,1,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2018,166.0,1,,,SI,,23,40,,10.1007/s10645-017-9312-9,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,FV8YD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424872700003,0

This paper puts forward a new time series prediction method based on data fluctuation network, named data fluctuation networks predictive model (DFNPM). The basic idea of the method is: first map time series into data fluctuation network and extract the fluctuation features of time series according to the topological structure of the networks, and then construct models with useful information extracted to predict time series. With Cushing, OK Crude Oil Future Contract 1 (Dollars per Barrel) and New York Harbor Regular Gasoline Future Contract 1 (Dollars per Gallon) as its sample data as well as DFNPM as its prediction model, the research makes a prediction on crude oil and gasoline futures prices from December 30,2014 to February 26, 2015. A comparison is conducted between the result of the prediction and such traditional prediction models as grey prediction (GM) model, exponential smoothing model (ESM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and radial basis function neural network (RBF) model, which shows that DFNPM performs significantly better than the above four traditional prediction models in both the direction and level of prediction.

We find that even though each government can improve welfare when it chooses R&D subsidy policy simultaneously, choosing output subsidy policy for both exporting governments is dominant strategy regardless of the degree of R&D spillover effect. This leads both governments to face prisoners' dilemma. Thus, even though the subsidies may cause trade disputes since direct subsidies are prohibited under WTO, our paper can provide the reason why some countries have incentives to use output subsidy policy rather than using R&D subsidy policy. On equilibrium path, it follows that social welfare under government non-intervention (e.g. free trade) is higher than under output subsidy. Furthermore, whether to reach the Pareto-superior cooperative R&D equilibrium, we provide some discussions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a feature selection based on mutual information is implemented for day ahead prediction of electricity prices, which are so valuable for determining the redundancy and relevancy of selected features. A combination of wavelet transform (WT) and a hybrid forecast method is presented based on a neural network (NN). Furthermore, an intelligent algorithm is considered for a prediction process to set the proposed forecast engine free parameters based NN. This optimisation process improved the accuracy of the proposed model. To demonstrate the validity of this model, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market is considered as a test case and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. These comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","[Ebrahimian, Homayoun] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Engn, Ardabil Branch, Ardebil, Iran; [Barmayoon, Saeed; Ghadimi, Noradin] Islamic Azad Univ, Ardabil Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Ardebil, Iran; [Mohammadi, Mohsen] Payame Noor Univ PNU, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; Payame Noor University,"Ghadimi, N (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Ardabil Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Ardebil, Iran.",noradin.ghadimi@iauardabil.ac.ir,"Ghadimi, Noradin/AAF-3603-2019",,,,,,25,204,206,9,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Both cities were conduits for moving meat and grain from fertile hinterlands to eastern markets. However, despite their initial similarities, Chicago was vastly more prosperous for most of the twentieth century. Can the differences between the cities after 1930 be explained by differences in the cities before that date? We highlight four major differences between Buenos Aires and Chicago in 1914. Chicago was slightly richer, and significantly better educated. Chicago was more industrially developed, with about 2.25 times more capital per worker. Finally, Chicago's political situation was far more stable and it was not a political capital. Human capital seems to explain the lion's share of the divergent path of the two cities and their countries, both because of its direct effect and because of the connection between education and political instability.","[Campante, Filipe; Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Campante, Filipe; Glaeser, Edward L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu,,,John S. and Cynthia Reed foundation; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,John S. and Cynthia Reed foundation; Taubman Center for State and Local Government,Both authors thank the John S. and Cynthia Reed foundation for financial support.

But, the literature has largely disagreed on the direction of causation in cases when cointegration was found. This paper addresses this issue and provides new evidence by using an approach that accounts for the potential of asymmetric cointegration and multiple structural breaks. This was done using Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) and Momentum TAR (MTAR) models. Some key findings emerge: first, the variables are cointegrated with significant asymmetric error-correction adjustments, and the US REER is found to be weakly exogenous in this process. When exogenous shocks cause disequilibrium, then the adjustment is slower in the case of when a downward adjustment of real oil prices is needed to regain equilibrium, compared to the case of when an upward adjustment is needed. This asymmetry could be driven by downward rigidity in oil prices. Second, it follows that long-run causation is unidirectional, going from the US REER to real oil prices, however, there is bidirectional causation in the short run. The estimations accounted for four structural breaks found in the sample. Overall findings imply that countries exporting to the US may lose competitiveness in the long run not only because of an increased conversion price but also through the upward pressure on oil prices. From a US perspective, increased competitiveness leads to increased real oil prices, which may temper the gains of oil intensive exports in the long run. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Following the decomposition-reconstruction-prediction concept, a combined Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-Least Square Support Vector Machine-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA) model is proposed for quantitatively analyzing and forecasting coal overcapacity in China. The results show that the main causes of coal overcapacity in China include insufficient demand, market failure, and institutional distortion. Institutional distortion, with an influence degree of 73.75%, is the most fundamental and influential factor. From 2017 to 2019, the scale of coal overcapacity in China will reach between 1.721 and 1.819 billion tons, suggesting that coal overcapacity will remain a serious problem. The rate of coal overcapacity caused by insufficient demand will fluctuate slightly, while coal overcapacity caused by market failure will trend downward, but the impact of institutional distortion on coal overcapacity will be exacerbated. A statistical analysis demonstrates that the EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA model significantly outperformed other widely developed baselines (e.g. ARIMA, LSSVM, EEMD-ARIMA, and EEMD-LSSVM). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It shows that over the observation period between 1995 and 2008, the Chinese economy was concentrated relatively more in the manufacturing sector and relatively less in the service sector than the Russian economy. In addition, this paper finds that the higher economic growth rate in real GDP and aggregate labour productivity growth between 1996 and 2008 in China than in Russia was broadly based, with most industries contributing to China's better performance. Furthermore, it reveals that the acceleration in economic growth in China in 2003-2008 over 1996-2002 was mainly traced to an increased contribution from the manufacturing sector and to a lesser degree the service sector, while in Russia, it was the service sector, followed by the primary sector driven by the mining and oil and gas extraction industry. These results suggest that the Chinese and Russian economies complement each other, which bodes well for further economic cooperation and trade between the two countries.","[Zhao, Jingfeng] Northwest Univ, Res Ctr Western Chinas Econ Dev, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tang, Jianmin] Innovat Sci & Econ Dev, Toronto, ON, Canada",Northwest University Xi'an,"Tang, JM (通讯作者)，Innovat Sci & Econ Dev, Toronto, ON, Canada.",jianmin.tang@canada.ca,"Zhao, Xujun/IRZ-4119-2023; JIANMIN, TANG/JBS-6054-2023","JIANMIN, TANG/0000-0001-6091-9682",,,,,11,66,70,7,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Therefore, a key part of a company's strategy is the measurement of this dissatisfaction. It is important to conduct periodic surveys on complaints in a standard form like the SERVPERF scale because it enables the organization to benchmark. Many of these complaints are stored in the company's CRM. Our first aim is to define a model to transform CRM customer complaints, expressed in natural language, into SERVPERF scales. In the proposed model, we use the 2-tuple model, which allows computing this linguistic data without losing information. Our second purpose is to implement a prototype to apply the model in a 4G Company.

Firm effects account for 40 percent of the total decrease and worker effects for 29 percent. Changes in observable worker and firm characteristics contributed little to these trends. Instead, the decrease is primarily due to a compression of returns to these characteristics, particularly a declining firm productivity-pay premium.

We also introduce a novel approach based on the autocorrelation of returns. We test all models on a unique dataset of wine prices.

Thus, if wine investors herd, it is essentially because of external contingencies and they are not driven by the state of the wine market itself.

A collective model generates predictions concerning the impact of the birth of sons on family behaviour when son preference is treated as a premium in the father's utility function. Using data from China, I show that, with more sons instead of daughters, the time spent by both men and women on housework rises, while men have to increase their work time in the labour market and women can reduce theirs. The results are consistent with theoretical predictions and are robust for use in further tests. For the possible endogeneity of children's gender, I use the law forbidding the use of ultrasound-B to reveal the gender of a foetus as instrumental variables as the identification strategy.","[Bo, Shiyu] Jinan Univ, IESR, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Bo, SY (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",boshiyu@outlook.com,"Bo, Shiyu/JXN-6741-2024","Bo, Shiyu/0000-0001-8364-2073",,,,,45,5,7,6,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Low idiosyncratic firm-level risk is found to be a feature of highly developed, stable economies, whereas the countercyclicality of firm-level risk is associated with flexible as well as stable economies. These facts are uncovered with the help of a theoretical model where small, risk-averse firms display procyclical risk, whereas larger, risk-neutral firms have countercyclical risk patterns that depend on the rigidity of the business environment. The predictions of the model are then confirmed by the data using a large international firm-level database (ORBIS) together with the World Bank Doing Business Database, during the Great Recession across 55 countries. The findings are critical for the growing literature of uncertainty driven business cycles, and show that firm-level uncertainty cannot be treated as an exogenous parameter.","[Boedo, Hernan Moscoso] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Econ, Carl H Lindner Coll Business, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Boedo, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Cincinnati, Dept Econ, Carl H Lindner Coll Business, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",hernan.moscoso@uc.edu,,"Moscoso Boedo, Hernan/0000-0003-2511-0778",,,,,30,0,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Instrumental variables regressions indicate that a 1% increase in R&D tax incentives causes a statistically significant 2.8-3.8% increase in R&D. Alternatively, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of R&D expenditures on R&D tax incentives, which do not correct for the policy endogeneity of R&D tax incentives, indicate that a 1% increase in R&D tax incentives causes a statistically insignificant 0.4-0.7% increase in R&D.

We find that neither changes in earnings quality nor the earnings lack of timeliness hypothesis can explain the decline in the value relevance of accounting information in the KSE. Based on the stylized facts associated with the growth of the KSE and the broader economics literature, we argue that the reduction in the explanatory power of accounting information vis-a-vis stock returns was caused by herding behaviour. Empirical estimates from state-space model of herding behaviour confirm the existence of herding, and we find that the value relevance of accounting information is significantly lower in periods characterized by herding behaviour. This article is also amongst the first attempts to empirically demonstrate that an expansionary monetary policy and increases in foreign portfolio investment lead to increased levels of herding.","[Chaudhry, Muhammad Imran] Karachi Sch Business & Leadership, Karachi, Pakistan; [Sam, Abdoul G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Sam, AG (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sam.7@osu.edu,"Chaudhry, Muhammad/AAX-1374-2021","Chaudhry, Muhammad Imran/0000-0002-1855-3557",,,,,52,8,8,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Furthermore, it studies whether domestic firms undergo different influences by foreign firms according to the size of domestic firms. Design/methodology/approach Korean firm-level data for the period of 2006 through 2013 provided by Statistics Korea are used to study the impact of the foreign investment on the exit and sales of the domestic firms. Findings The result shows that foreign firms crowd out small firms from the market and take their shares in the domestic market. On the other hand, larger firms rather enjoy positive spillover effect from foreign firms, reducing its exit probability and increasing sales. It may be that large firms have enough competitiveness and ability to learn and apply the advanced technology of the foreign firms. Practical implications Despite the strong belief on the positive impacts of the foreign firms such as knowledge spillovers or job creation, there might be crowding-out or market-stealing effect from the presence of foreign firms. If the latter effect is larger than positive effect, the incentives provided by host country government to the multinational firms cannot be justified. In this regard, the question addressed in this paper is very important. Originality/value While most of previous papers have focused on the impacts of the foreign firms on productivity of the domestic firms, this paper deals with their impacts on the exit and sales of the domestic firms in order to examine more direct crowding-out and market-stealing effect of foreign firms.","[Choi, Hyelin] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Int Macroecon, Sejong Si, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Choi, H (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Int Macroecon, Sejong Si, South Korea.",hlchoi@kiep.go.kr,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Recent evidence shows that MFI performance with regard to funds issued for small business start-ups depends on MFI-level characteristics such as profit orientation. We argue that these decisions do not only depend on MFI-specific practices or characteristics, but also on the role ethnic diversity plays. Using data on microfinance lending activities for business start-ups, we examine the impact of ethnic diversity on microenterprise start-ups. Results show that ethnic diversity negatively affects the provision of financial capital for business start-up. Furthermore, results also suggest a negative association between ethnic diversity and the share of female borrowers recorded by MFIs. We examine social networks and outreach as potential channels through which ethnic diversity affects business start-ups.","[Churchill, Sefa Awaworyi] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Mishra, Vinod] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Monash University,"Mishra, V (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",vinod.mishra@monash.edu,"Churchill, Sefa Awaworyi/AFR-0355-2022; Mishra, Vinod/D-1221-2011","Churchill, Sefa Awaworyi/0000-0002-1930-9177; Mishra, Vinod/0000-0002-4686-5195",,,,,76,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our bootstrapped results show that in the long run, with larger samples, there is less competitive balance in the new competition structure than in the older structure competition structure.

In this paper we compare the degree of fiscal transfers in the EU to those in the U.S. and estimate the changes needed to make the EU more like the U.S. Data on American inter-state fiscal transfers show that, on average, the most affluent states consistently make significantly larger payments to the federal government than they receive from it and that the opposite is true for the less affluent states. Our research shows that, unlike in the U.S., fiscal transfers in the EU are not closely related to a member state's standard of living. We also find that, compared to the U.S., the least affluent nations in the EU receive disproportionally small net payments from the common budget. An American-style fiscal union would require more affluent EU members to make net contributions many times over their actual net payments.","[Dadak, Casimir] Hollins Univ, Econ & Finance, Roanoke, VA 24019 USA; [Matkovskyy, Roman] Rennes Sch Business, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Dadak, C (通讯作者)，Hollins Univ, Econ & Finance, Roanoke, VA 24019 USA.",,"Matkovskyy, Roman/AAM-5508-2020","Matkovskyy, Roman/0000-0001-6270-7202",,,,,67,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We show that financial constraints lead to two distinct types of pecuniary externalities: distributive externalities that arise from incomplete insurance markets and collateral externalities that arise from price-dependent financial constraints. For both types of externalities, we identify three sufficient statistics that determine optimal taxes on financing and investment decisions to implement constrained efficient allocations. We also show that fire sales and financial amplification are neither necessary nor sufficient to generate inefficient pecuniary externalities. We demonstrate how to employ our framework in a number of applications. Whereas collateral externalities generally lead to over-borrowing, the distortions from distributive externalities may easily flip sign, leading to either under- or over-borrowing. Both types of externalities may lead to under- or over-investment.","[Davila, Eduardo] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Korinek, Anton] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Korinek, Anton] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; Johns Hopkins University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Korinek, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Korinek, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",akorinek@jhu.edu,,,Lamfalussy Fellowship of the ECB; Institute for New Economic Thinking; NFI; Rafael del Pino Foundation,Lamfalussy Fellowship of the ECB; Institute for New Economic Thinking; NFI; Rafael del Pino Foundation,"This article combines the manuscripts Systemic Risk-Taking: Amplification Effects, Externalities, and Regulatory Responses by Anton Korinek (2011) and Dissecting Fire Sales Externalities by Eduardo Davila (2014).

This paper shows how channels of transmission matter for productivity spillovers from FDI by providing more fuller and nuanced picture of the effects. We analyse a panel of eight sub-Saharan Africa countries spanning the period 2006-2014 and demonstrate the empirical relevance of distinguishing three channels-demonstration, labour mobility, and competition. We provide measures of these effects and also show that the size, significance, and sign of spillover effects depend on the local absorptive capacity, technology levels, geographical proximity, and foreign ownership structure. Overall, results suggest that demonstration spillovers are large and economically significant, whereas the patterns of labour mobility and competition spillovers are not stable across the various specifications and measures. Finally, the analysis involves several measures of further investigations and robustness checks. Results are robust to the construction of spillover and outcome variables, the introduction of additional explanatory variables and an alternative estimation method.","[Demena, Binyam Afewerk; Murshed, Syed Mansoob] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Dev Econ, The Hague, Netherlands; [Murshed, Syed Mansoob] Coventry Univ, Econ Finance & Accounting, Coventry, W Midlands, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Coventry University,"Demena, BA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Dev Econ, The Hague, Netherlands.",demena@iss.nl,"Demena, Binyam Afewerk/AAF-6961-2021; Murshed, Syed Mansoob/AAY-3622-2020","Demena, Binyam Afewerk/0000-0002-9059-5364; Murshed, Syed Mansoob/0000-0002-8360-033X",,,,,70,23,25,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In our model, politically connected firms gain a comparative advantage in contract-intensive and financially-dependent sectors. But political connections also have an adverse effect on firm exports because of managerial inefficiency. The overall effect is thus ambiguous and differs across sectors.

To make the well-being comparable across households of different sizes and composition, sometimes income per capita is used. However, such an approach assumes that all individuals' needs are the same in households and there are no economies of scale in consumption. Thus, to take into account these issues, equivalence scales could be applied. Equivalence scales are measures of the relative incomes required by households of different size and composition to attain a similar standard of living. A wide range of equivalence scales exist. In this study we estimate subjective equivalence scales based on MINQ (minimum income question). We choose this method mostly due to its acceptance among applied welfare researchers. The main aim of our study is to verify whether the equivalence scales in the Visegrad Group countries are the same as the OECD-modified scale. Our results based on EU-SILC data for 2015 indicate that the relative cost of a child in Poland exceeds the relative cost of an additional adult whereas in Hungary opposite relationship is observed. Moreover, in all the Visegrad Group countries stronger economies of scale than the OECD-modified scale assumes are observed.","[Dudek, Hanna; Chrzanowska, Mariola] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, SGGW, Fac Appl Informat & Math, 159 Nowoursynowska Stree, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Dudek, H (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, SGGW, Fac Appl Informat & Math, 159 Nowoursynowska Stree, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",hanna_dudek@sggw.pl; mariola_chrzanowska@sggw.pl,"Dudek, Hanna/T-9763-2017","Dudek, Hanna/0000-0001-8261-2745",,,,,18,1,1,0,1,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,65,71,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500008,0

In particular, the role of social enterprises in labour market integration of socially excluded individuals is analysed within the existing theoretical and policy discourses of exclusion. Taking into account the difficulties in measuring the social impact of social enterprises, our study contributes to the quantitative literature on the performance of social enterprises, taking the number of integrated people as a measure of the impact on social exclusion. The research is based on data on the employment of marginalized groups, derived from a unique dataset collected by a recently conducted survey of social enterprises in Serbia. The original methodological framework combines statistical methods and multi-criteria decision making model, in order to evaluate the contribution of different types of enterprises to the employment of excluded individuals. Weights determination for the MCDM model is performed using entropy while TOPSIS method is applied for the ranking of the types of social enterprises according to the employment of socially excluded categories. The results indicate that enterprises for employment of persons with disabilities, citizens' associations and cooperatives in Serbia contribute the most in integrating the socially excluded.","[Dzunic, Marija; Stankovic, Jelena; Jankovic-Milic, Vesna] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis,"Dzunic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia.",marija_dzunic@ni.ac.rs,"Jankovic-Milic, Vesna/AGM-4935-2022; Stanković, Jelena J./P-6945-2018; Milic, Vesna Jankovic/W-4709-2019; Dzunic, Marija/HME-2028-2023; Dubisetty, Mallikarjuna Rao/JWO-4481-2024","Jankovic-Milic, Vesna/0000-0002-9645-8598; Stanković, Jelena J./0000-0002-9875-9861; Dzunic, Marija/0000-0001-5269-1921;","Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development","Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This work was supported by the Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development.",,98,10,11,2,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

There are inherent differences in worker ability and across-firm productivity. Two fundamental questions are whether the exact composition of skills of workers and productivity of firms affects output and how this composition determines the equilibrium allocation of workers within a firm and between firms. There has been a surge of research investigating the causes and consequences of the process of allocation of heterogeneous workers to firms. The focus in this review is on theory that sheds light on open questions in macroeconomics, labor, and industrial organization, with a particular emphasis on the role of firm size. Those models allow us to infer from the observed sorting patterns (who matches with whom) what the underlying technological determinants are and how they have evolved in recent decades. Furthermore, they help us understand the technological origins of important labor market trends, such as the increase in wage inequality and the change in labor market and firm dynamics.","[Eeckhout, Jan] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, ICREA, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Eeckhout, Jan] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England",ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University; University of London; University College London,"Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, ICREA, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Eeckhout, J (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England.",jan.eeckhout@upf.edu,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008",,,,,,87,11,12,1,15,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

With this methodology, we can distinguish the effects resulting from the introduction of neutral or biased technological change on TFP, called neutral factor productivity and biased factor productivity (BFP), respectively. The new measure of TFP also holds in extreme cases where only the effect of neutral/biased technological change is presented. In particular, the BFP component increases (decreases) when the productivity of the cheaper (more expensive) factor increases. Moreover, the TFP holds up to the modification of both units of measure and to the costs of factors. Finally, the intensity of the BFP is independent of the direction of the technological change.","[Feder, Christophe] Univ Vallee dAoste, Univ Valle dAosta, SEP Dept, Grand Chemin 75-77, I-11020 St Christophe, Italy",Universita Della Valle D'aosta,"Feder, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vallee dAoste, Univ Valle dAosta, SEP Dept, Grand Chemin 75-77, I-11020 St Christophe, Italy.",c.feder1@univda.it,"Feder, Christophe/AHC-3437-2022","Feder, Christophe/0000-0002-1239-513X",,,,,54,16,17,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

One overlooked area of research is the impact that cognitive impairment (an early marker of potential dementia onset) has on the healthcare utilization of an ageing population. Based on the theoretical micro-economic foundations of healthcare demand, we study the relationship between cognitive functioning and impairment, measured by word recall and changes thereof, and healthcare utilization among over 50s in nine European countries. The contribution of this article is to produce estimates for cognitive functioning and impairment, as opposed to full dementia, in the context of healthcare utilization.We apply regression models to healthcare utilization data from Waves 1, 2 and 4 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and find that recalling one additional word is associated with a reduction in visits to a medical doctor of 0.32, per year (p<0.01). Even after controlling for self-assessed health, this association is strong at just over 0.1 visits - this is the additional impact, over and above the average number of visits for similar individuals without cognitive impairment.","[Gannon, Brenda] Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Banks, James] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Banks, James] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Nazroo, James] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Sociol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Munford, Luke] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Queensland; University of Manchester; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Gannon, B (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",brenda.gannon@uq.edu.au,"Gannon, Brenda/D-2011-2017; Banks, James/C-2022-2008","Gannon, Brenda/0000-0002-3672-4030; Banks, James/0000-0002-9726-8921","Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing (MICRA); University of Manchester Research Initiative (UMRI), at University of Manchester, UK; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/N015126/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing (MICRA); University of Manchester Research Initiative (UMRI), at University of Manchester, UK; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","It is an internal grant awarded by Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research in Ageing (MICRA) and University of Manchester Research Initiative (UMRI), at University of Manchester, UK.

Secondly, we provide evidence that economies with high bond share and important bond-loan substitution recover from the recessions faster. This identified link between corporate debt structure and business cycles is robust to the inclusion of traditional factors which shape recessions and recovery such as the size and the quality of financial markets, the occurrence of bank crisis, the dynamics of credit, and the distribution of firm size.

At the same time, the failure in innovation projects may induce the firm to collaborate in order to overcome the problems that determined the failure of innovation projects (induced collaboration). Up to now, we are not aware about the existence of any empirical paper analysing the interaction between these two mechanisms.

According to OCA criteria we find that Latin America is far from being an optimum currency area, as its countries' exposure to asymmetric shocks is high and their capacities to adjust in response to macroeconomic disturbances are limited. Using a panel of 20 Latin American countries from 1990 to 2014, we apply the dynamic OLS estimation techniques to estimate the costs and benefits of a potential monetary union in Latin America and in its various RTAs. to estimate the costs and benefits of a potential monetary union in Latin America and in its various RTAs. We find that the costs are high, because Latin America's economies are vulnerable to severe macroeconomic disturbances and its RTAs differ significantly in their response to negative demand shocks. Most of the monetary efficiency gains are shown to be the result of a common restrictive monetary policy which would result in higher FDI inflows and, to a more limited extent, increased GDP, both overall and per capita. Although Central American countries are shown to be most suitable for further monetary integration, we conclude that Latin American countries should head first towards greater economic and political integration.","[Hafner, Kurt A.] Heilbronn Univ, Fac Int Business, Heilbronn, Germany; [Kampe, Lennart] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Fac Econ & Behav Sci, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Hafner, KA (通讯作者)，Max Planck Str 39, D-74081 Heilbronn, Germany.",kurt.hafner@gmx.net,,,,,,,54,4,4,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This has occasioned controversies among economists and philosophers around the normative limits of paternalism, especially by technical policy advisors. One recent suggestion has been that 'boosting,' in which interventions aim to enhance people's general cognitive skills and representational repertoires instead of manipulating their choice environments behind their backs, avoids the main normative challenges. A limitation in most of this literature is that it has focused on relatively sweeping policy recommendations and consequently on strong polar alternatives of general paternalism and strict laissez faire. We review a real instance, drawn from a consulting project we conducted for an investment bank, of a proposed intervention that is more typical of the kind that economists are more often actually called upon to offer. In this example, the sophistication of current tools for preference attribution, combined with philosophical externalism about the semantics of preferences that makes it less plausible to attribute their literal self-conscious representation to people as propositional attitude content becomes more tightly refined, blocks applicability of the distinction between nudging and boosting. This seems to call for irreducible, context-specific ethical judgment in assessing the appropriateness of the forms of paternalism that economists must actually wrestle with in going about their everyday business.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Georgia State Univ, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ross, Don] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Cork, Ireland",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Cape Town; University College Cork,"Ross, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Ross, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.;Ross, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Cork, Ireland.",don.ross@uct.ac.za,,"Ross, Don/0000-0003-1813-3111",,,,,49,13,14,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

With advances being made in smart phones, enterprises are increasingly considering expanding their customer base through mobile commerce services. To promote m-commerce improvement, enterprises should organize an excellent m-commerce environment and attempt to realize user needs in the era of IoT. In a fuzzy environment of the real world, objective decision-making for m-commerce improvement is usually a FMADM problem involving feedback-effect and interdependence among the dimensions and criteria. But, many traditional decision models cannot conduct the complicated interrelationships among dimensions and criteria. This study proposes an improvement model that can promote m-commerce improvement towards achieving the aspiration level in fuzzy environment. The proposed hybrid model conducts the feedback-effect and dependence among attributes, and it combines the FDEMATEL technique, FDANP, and MFGRA methods. The empirical case study was conducted to prove the utility of the new hybrid FMADM model in evaluating an m-commerce environment. Comparative results exhibited that the proposed approach is superior to the traditional method and that it can obtain most real grey relational degree that can be used for establishing the best performance improvement strategy in reality.","[Hu, Shu-Kung] Kainan Univ, Dept Business & Entrepreneurial Management, 1 Kainan Rd, Taoyuan 33875, Taiwan; [Liou, James J.

Normalization can be considered as a foundation for rational MADM methods, which should deal with target-based criteria in addition to cost and benefit criteria. Although a good number of applications have been reported for point target criteria in MADM problems, in selection problems related to engineering design, it might be better to let the material and design criteria vary over a range in order to increase flexibility in subsequent design stages. The mentioned point supports a readily adaptable design in changing the customer requirements, which is also significant in offering a robust design. In this research, performance of three promising target-based normalization methods was investigated using simulation experiments to examine the effect of simulation parameters. The effect of parameters and normalization methods was examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Moreover, the best structure formula was identified to propose an inclusive range target-based normalization method. The suggested normalization method was used to enhance the capability of Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method and applied to a real-word problem dealing with benefit-, cost-, and point target-based criteria as well as the range criterion.","[Jahan, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semnan Branch, Semnan, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Jahan, A (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semnan Branch, Semnan, Iran.",iranalijahan@yahoo.com,"Jahan, Ali/B-2460-2010","Jahan, Ali/0000-0001-6347-1676","Islamic Azad University, Semnan Branch [4046]","Islamic Azad University, Semnan Branch(Islamic Azad University)","This research project was supported by Islamic Azad University, Semnan Branch, with Grant no. 4046, and the author would like to show his grateful thanks for the close cooperation.",,61,10,11,0,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Design/methodology/approach Using the firm-level data during 2000-2009, the authors drive the difference-in-difference-in-difference model on Wagner (2007) with the dependent variables of labor productivity and employments and the independent variables of free trade agreement, revealed comparative advantage, firm size and payroll costs. Findings The authors find that the economic benefit of FTAs in Korea is not concentrated in large enterprises or firms with comparative advantage. Accordingly, the authors conclude that FTA or trade liberalization brings positive effects to business as a whole, rather than to specific industries or group of firms. Research limitations/implications The Korean Government has continued its policy of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for a long time by recognizing them as socially underprivileged. According to the results of this study, an increase in export through FTAs improves firm's labor productivity and increases employment, especially for SMEs, which can be a practical and efficient support for them. Originality/value The paper provides the empirical evidences that how the effects of trade liberalization on labor depend on firm heterogeneity, industrial competitiveness and/or both and thus how labor is reallocated in response to trade liberalization in Korea.","[Jang, Yong Joon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Mee Jin] Myongji Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, HanSung] Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Myongji University; Ajou University,"Cho, MJ (通讯作者)，Myongji Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",mjcho@mju.ac.kr,"Jang, Yong Joon/AAJ-8754-2020","Jang, Yong Joon/0000-0001-5338-9804",,,,,32,0,0,1,13,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Effective corporate governance can align managers' short-term-oriented incentives with shareholders' long-term interests. Because the board of directors is the paramount governance mechanism, we explore the role of board governance on managerial myopia. In particular, we investigate the effect of independent directors on corporate innovation. To minimize endogeneity, we exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that raises board independence. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that board independence leads to significantly higher investments in innovation as well as higher innovation productivity.

Our multidimensional productivity index (MPI) not only measures individual productivities of economic resources but also evaluate productivity enhancing general capacities of economy. Individual productivity indices such as labor productivity are limited because they do not consider the factors, such as the globalization of economies and the market and institutional variables, that could have profound impacts on productivity.

Our methodology employs the concept of technical efficiency that allows us to measure the extent to which institutional and market factors contribute to the economic performance.

However, when controlling for the average tolerance to risk score of the teams, the performance advantage of all-men teams vanishes, while the team-specific economic performance of teams with four women is still positive and strong. Teams with four women take more risks than the team tolerance to risk score would predict, which suggests some form of team specific action bias or risk-shift. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The forward looking banking decisions cause a commitment problem with respect to regulator's next period allowance supply decision. We tackle the commitment problem by focusing on the Markov equilibrium of the policy. The equilibrium policy has a surprisingly simple structure, combining features from both price and quantity instruments. The regulator's ability to choose a new cap for each period does not render banking obsolete, but on the contrary, makes banking an integral part of the equilibrium policy. Using data from the EU ETS to calibrate the model, we solve the Markov equilibrium policy for the case of carbon emissions regulation and compare Markov policies with and without the possibility to bank allowances. A counterfactual analysis of the EU ETS, during the period of 2009-2013, shows that the optimal Markov policy would have led to a steadier allowance price level and a stricter emission regulation than what was actually observed in the EU ETS.

Even though individual tests provide evidence that, within our universe of betting rules, positive returns can be achieved, when data-snooping bias is taken into account, the evidence diminishes. Subsequently, we also find very little evidence of return differentials between betting rules.

Yet, the forty-year secular decline in the dollar has been one with a secular expansion of U.S. trade deficits.

The study employs a dynamic network data envelopment analysis for performance evaluation of insurer (life, general and composite insurers) and ownership (local and foreign) types, spanning the period 2007-2014. The findings reveal a lack of efficiency in the investment capability function among local insurers as compared to their foreign counterparts. While the composite or non-specialized segment performs better in the investment capability function, the general segment achieves better efficiency in the premium accumulation function. The results suggest the high usage of input quantities and lack of total investment as key reasons for low efficiency, particularly among the local insurers.

I find that benefits should be frontloaded; the government has the incentive to drive the allocation to the point where the firm's participation constraint binds. At this point wages are equal to productivity in every period, wealth exceeds the buffer stock level, and consumption and savings drop over time. The drop in the level of consumption during unemployment is mitigated. Finally, I compare the optimal contract model to the standard heterogeneous agent model whereby wealth is utilized for self-insurance purposes. I show that the two models are equivalent under the optimal UI policy.","[Oikonomou, Rigas] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Coll LH Dupriez, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Oikonomou, R (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Coll LH Dupriez, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",rigas.oikonomou@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This paper examines the role that macroeconomic policy plays in explaining this variation. We find that the degree of monetary and fiscal policy space prior to financial distressthat is, whether the policy interest rate is above the zero lower bound and whether the debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively lowgreatly affects the aftermath of crises. The decline in output following a crisis is less than 1% when a country possesses both types of policy space, but almost 10% when it has neither. The difference is highly statistically significant and robust to the measures of policy space and the sample. We also consider the mechanisms by which policy space matters. We find that monetary and fiscal policy are used more aggressively when policy space is ample. Financial distress itself is also less persistent when there is policy space. The findings may have implications for policy during both normal times and periods of acute financial distress.","[Romer, Christina D.; Romer, David H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Romer, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,19,37,42,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2018,85.0,337,,,,,1,40,,10.1111/ecca.12258,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FP0CU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417267600001,0

We also examine TFPC and contrast implications derived from the component models with those from a directly estimated TFPC model. Our results show that TC and SMEC are both significantly impacted by innovation through public research and improved human capital through education and health care access. TEC and SMEC are significantly affected by farm size, and the latter is significantly affected by public policy. The ratio of family-to-total labour, terms of trade and precipitation have significant impacts on all three components, but extension has no significant impact on any component. Climate change variables are the most impactful factors on each component as well as on TFPC. While the impact of climate change is heterogeneous across regions and components, its estimated historical impact is most often positive. Nearly all TFPC elasticities estimated directly are qualitatively the same as those calculated from the component models and quantitatively similar.","[Sabasi, Darlington] Beloit Coll, Dept Econ, Beloit, WI 53511 USA; [Shumway, C.

In particular, we examine the yet under-researched role of increasing opportunity costs resulting from larger home-stadium distances in STH stadium attendance demand. Our results suggest that STHs' geographical location plays an important role in predicting STH stadium attendance demand. More specifically, we observe an unexpected, nonlinear distance-attendance relationship, indicating that behaviourally loyal STHs live either exceptionally close or far away from the stadium.","[Schreyer, Dominik; Schmidt, Sascha L.] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Ctr Sports & Management, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Schmidt, Sascha L.; Torgler, Benno] CREMA, Zurich, Switzerland; [Torgler, Benno] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Schreyer, D (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Ctr Sports & Management, Dusseldorf, Germany.",dominik.schreyer@whu.edu,"Torgler, Benno/W-4556-2019; Schreyer, Dominik/AAG-7094-2020","Torgler, Benno/0000-0002-9809-963X; Schreyer, Dominik/0000-0003-1129-7789",,,,,26,21,21,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Previous literature that examines this question mainly considers imported intermediate inputs as a homogenous group and is unable to reach a consensus on the effects of input tariff liberalization on employment and wages of skilled and unskilled workers. Exploiting detailed product-level information available on intermediate inputs from plant-level data for the Indian manufacturing sector, I distinguish between plants that import mainly for quality considerations as opposed to plants that seek imports as cheaper alternatives to domestic inputs. I find that strong complementarities exist between skilled workers and imported inputs for plants importing high-quality inputs. For plants importing intermediate inputs mainly as a cost-cutting strategy, input tariff liberalization leads to an increase in employment of both skilled and unskilled workers, but a decline in skill composition. This can best be explained as a strategy that achieves economies of scale. On average, as input tariffs liberalize, importing plants employ more workers and pay higher wages than non-importing plants.","[Sharma, Shruti] Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Sharma, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",shrutis@iima.ac.in,,,,,,,18,4,4,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We develop a model of a special type of oligopolistic market, controlled by a group of dominant firms, and a general oligopolistic market, with heterogeneously sized firms. This model provides empirically testable implications related to the long-run determinants of the income distribution. Using two measures of the degree of market concentration, the k-firm concentration ratio (CRk) and the Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI), we find a negative association between these concentration measures (CRk and HHI) and the labor income share. In addition, analyzing a unique dataset of manufacturing firms based on five-and three-digit Korean Standard Industry Classifications from 2000 to 2011, we find a significantly negative relationship between the labor income share and the market concentration, which is consistent with the implications of the model. Overall, our results suggest that building a more competitive product market environment could alleviate national income inequality.","[Shim, Hyein] Korea Publ Finance Informat Serv, Fiscal Informat Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Chung, Chune Young] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5B5A02025566],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","The authors are grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions of Tiago Cavalcanti, Kooksin Ahn, Baegeun Kim, and Heejin Yang.

Migration outflows from Serbia to Germany negatively influenced permanent productivity shocks. Permanent productivity shocks were negatively correlated with remittances, which is also suggestive of the negative effect of migration outflows on permanent productivity shocks under the assumption that workers migrate to send money home.

We develop a structural model of the global movie market, including both consumers' movie demand choices and firms' exporting decisions. A movie studio is a multi-product firm that releases many movies within a year. We model movie quality as a combination of firm-level appeal and product-level attractiveness. We find that both studio-level and movie-level heterogeneity affect demand for movie, and movie-level heterogeneity is relatively more important. We also explore the counterfactual effects of quality improvement and trade liberalization on trade. Our results show that improvement of quality increases both intensive margin and extensive margin of trade. By elimination of quota, we find that trade liberalization increases movie exports to a foreign market by 19%. The results of our study can also help improve understanding of trade in the service industry. For instance, we do not find a positive correlation between the foreign entry costs and the geographic distance, as in the case of manufacture goods.","[Tang, Yihong; Yan, Jing; Yu, Feng] CUFE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yan, J (通讯作者)，CUFE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yan.jing@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,70,4,4,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Yet experimental evidence on actual consumers is mixed as to whether or not this is the case. Against this background, we examine the relationship between movie critics' reviews and the decision to see motion pictures in movie theatres. Based on an experimental approach using four treatments - no review, a poor/OK minus review, an OK/OK plus review and a very good review - movie-seeing decisions for seven movie genres are examined. What we find is at odds with experimental studies, yielding as they do mixed results for the association between favourable reviews and movie preference. Seemingly unrelated regressions consistently show that the better the expert review of a movie, the more likely it is that people will see it. Yet the magnitude of the effects of expert reviews appears both somewhat genre specific and gender specific.","[Thrane, Christer] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Lillehammer, Norway",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Thrane, C (通讯作者)，Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Lillehammer, Norway.",christer.thrane@inn.no,,,,,,,28,5,6,5,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To deal with concerns of identification, we instrument for firearm background checks with state-year-level Google search intensity for phrases that reflect fear of future gun shortages and learning about the constitutional rights of firearm owners. We find that an increase in firearm ownership has a sizable and statistically significant impact on firearm suicide rates. A 10% increase in firearm ownership increases firearm suicide rates by approximately 3%, which is five times larger than non-instrumented estimates. Furthermore, we find no effect of gun ownership on non-firearm suicide rates, suggesting our findings are not simply capturing a suicide method substitution effect. The results are consistent with a variety of validity and robustness tests. Our results make clear the link between firearm ownership and firearm suicide rates, which have increased dramatically over the last decade.","[Vitt, David C.] Farmingdale State Coll, Dept Econ, Farmingdale, NY USA; [McQuoid, Alexander F.; Moore, Charles; Sawyer, Stephen] US Naval Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Farmingdale State College; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy,"McQuoid, AF (通讯作者)，US Naval Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA.",mcquoid@usna.edu,"Vitt, David/ABB-4640-2020","Vitt, David/0000-0002-1945-3400",,,,,40,4,8,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical analysis indicates that, first, crude oil prices are the nonlinear Granger-cause of the USD exchange rate, but not vice versa. Second, the USD exchange rate exerts a stronger and more stable negative influence on crude oil prices in the short term, and the influence gradually weakens after 2012.

Finally, a numerical example about energy policy selection is provided to illustrate the practicality and feasibility of the developed approach.","[Zeng, Shouzhen] Ningbo Univ, Ningbo 315100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yao] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100785, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; Beijing Normal University,"Xiao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100785, Peoples R China.",xinoyao@188.com,,,National Funds of Social Science of China [15BTJ010]; Zhejiang Province Natural Science Foundation [LY18G010007]; Zhejiang Province Soft Science Fund [2015C35007]; Statistical Scientific Key Research Project of China [2016LZ43]; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Projects of Zhejiang [16ZJQN022YB]; K.

We first perform a series of parameter stability tests and find strong evidence of instability in the parameters estimated for Granger causality tests. We then use the bootstrap rolling window approach to test the causality and find that the causality from commodity prices to both inflation and output is time-varying in the entire sample period and asymmetric in different phases of the business cycle. We also find evidence of the causality from both inflation and output to commodity prices in certain sub-periods. Further discussion on the cost-price mechanism through which the economy fluctuates cyclically suggests that the dynamic causality between commodity prices and inflation contributes to understanding the nature of economic fluctuations and to forecasting economic crises. Overall, our results provide a new perspective to disentangle economic fluctuations.","[Zhang, Xu] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoxing; Yao, Dengbao] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hang, Jianqin] Jiangsu Maritime Inst, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Audit University; Southeast University - China,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zx8387@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473036],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number [71473036].,,60,9,9,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The present paper comprehensively explores the profiles of the new generation of migrant workers in urban China. We find that the new generation migrants are more educated and skilled, and are likely to work in manufacturing and service industries than in the construction industry. Moreover, they tend to allocate more time to non-farm activities and have more months away from home per year in urban areas. In contrast to their predecessors, they tend to migrate to urban areas with their spouses, consume more in urban areas and send less money back home. Our findings suggest that the differences in features between the new generation of rural migrants and urban residents have become smaller and the integration of rural migrants into urban China has taken place gradually.","[Zhao, Liqiu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shouying] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Marxism, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University,"Zhao, LQ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liqiuzh@gmail.com; liusy18@126.com; wzhangtsu@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNF038],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"The authors thank the National Bureau of Statistics of China and the National Population and Family Planning Commission for the data.

Our main experimental treatment is the opportunity for subjects to negotiate with one another through unrestricted cheap-talk communication before a proposal is made and comes to a vote. We compare committees with no communication, committees where communication is public and messages are observed by all committee members, and committees where communication is private and any committee member can send a private message to any other committee member. We find that the opportunity to communicate has a significant impact on outcomes and coalitions. When communication is public, there are more universal coalitions and fewer majoritarian coalitions. With private communication, there are more majoritarian coalitions and fewer universal coalitions. With either type of communication coalitions occur more frequently and last longer than with no communication. The volume and content of communication is correlated with coalition type. These findings suggest a coordination role for communication that varies with the mode of communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This perspective assumes, in a manner consistent with the canonical New Keynesian model, that the quantity of money has no role to play in transmitting a central bank's actions to economic activity. This paper examines the validity of this claim and investigates the properties of alternative monetary policy rules based on control of the monetary base or a monetary aggregate in lieu of the capacity to manipulate a short-term interest rate. The results indicate that rules of this type have the potential to guide monetary policy decisions toward the achievement of a long-run nominal goal without being constrained by the zero lower bound on a nominal interest rate. They suggest, in particular, that by exerting its influence over the monetary base or a broader aggregate, the Federal Reserve could more effectively stabilize nominal income around a long-run target path, even in a low or zero interest-rate environment.

Journals demand more revisions, and papers have become bloated with numerous robustness checks and extensions. Even if the extra resulting revisions do on average lead to improved papers--a claim that is debatable--the cost is enormous. We argue that much of the time involved in these revisions is a waste of research effort. Another cause for concern is the level of disagreement amongst referees, a pattern that suggests a high level of arbitrariness in the review process. To identify and highlight what is going right and what is going wrong in the reviewing process, we wrote to a sample of former editors of the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Econometrica, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Journal of Financial Economics, and asked them for their thoughts about what might improve the process. We found a rough consensus that referees for top journals in economics tend to make similar, correctable mistakes. The italicized quotations throughout this paper are drawn from our correspondence with these editors and our own experience. Their insights are consistent with our own experiences as editors at the Journal of Finance and the Review of Financial Studies. Our objective is to highlight these mistakes and provide a roadmap for how to avoid them.","[Berk, Jonathan B.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Finance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Harvey, Campbell R.] Duke Univ Durham, Fuqua Sch Business, Finance, Durham, NC USA; [Hirshleifer, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Finance, Irvine, CA USA; [Hirshleifer, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Business Growth, Irvine, CA USA",Stanford University; Duke University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Berk, JB (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Finance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jbberk@stanford.edu; cam.harvey@duke.edu; david.h@uci.edu,"Hirshleifer, David/E-4342-2012; Harvey, Campbell/A-6106-2014; Harvey, Campbell/ABI-4900-2020; Berk, Jonathan/AAG-7851-2021","Hirshleifer, David/0000-0003-0280-8882; Harvey, Campbell/0000-0002-2397-652X;",,,,,14,14,18,0,47,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We use variation in gender shares by fields of study implied by the recent expansion of college education in 19 European countries, and a difference-in-differences research design, to show that the share of women in study peer groups does not drive early fertility. When there are few available potential partners in one's field of study, endogamous fertility by college graduates from the same field of study is lower, as expected, but non-endogamous fertility compensates for this effect for both genders. This compensation, however, comes at the cost of increasing the probability of parenting with a less-than-college educated spouse.","[Bicakova, Alena; Jurajda, Stepan] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bicakova, Alena; Jurajda, Stepan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences,"Jurajda, S (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague, Czech Republic.;Jurajda, S (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague, Czech Republic.",alena.bicakova@cerge-ei.cz; stepan.jurajda@cerge-ei.cz,"Jurajda, Stepan/H-2886-2014; Bicakova, Alena/H-2912-2014","Jurajda, Stepan/0000-0001-6176-2656; Bicakova, Alena/0000-0003-3801-0725",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G130],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This research has been supported by the Czech Science Foundation Grant P402/12/G130.,,39,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Using firm-level data for Chinese exporting firms during the period 2000-2006, we find evidence of an almost complete exchange rate pass through. As expected, when we distinguish firms by their trade regime, processing-trade firms, especially pure-assembly firms which tend to have higher import-content share, have a lower exchange rate pass-through than ordinary trade firms.

The OLS results suggest that Chinese development finance does not systematically flow to more authoritarian countries, controlling for strategic, economic, political, institutional and geographic confounding factors.

Exploiting within-country variation over time shows that this effect of pathogen exposure is significantly amplified by weather shocks.

Architects of the compulsory consolidation of numerous NSW councils in 2004, including the CVC, contended that larger merged councils would exhibit superior performance, especially in financial terms. In many respects, the CVC represented the 'jewel in the crown' of the 2003/04 NSW merger program given its iconic environmental circumstances. Unfortunately, comparatively little scholarly effort has been expended on examining the outcomes of compulsory council amalgamations of specific municipalities after considerable time has passed, in large part due to the thorny methodological difficulties involved. This paper seeks to remedy this gap in the empirical literature by developing a new methodological approach to the problem and using it to evaluate the financial performance of the CVC a decade after its forced merger as an illustrative case study.

First, we show that if financial markets are incomplete, the value of gaining access to any given level of aggregate risk sharing is greater for countries that are members of a currency union. Second, we show that even if financial markets are complete, privately optimal risk sharing is constrained inefficient. A role emerges for government intervention in risk sharing both to guarantee its existence and to influence its operation. The constrained efficient risk-sharing arrangement can be implemented by contingent transfers within a fiscal union. We find that the benefits of such a fiscal union are larger, the more asymmetric the shocks affecting the members of the currency union, the more persistent these shocks, and the less open the member economies. Finally, we compare the performance of fiscal unions and of other macroeconomic stabilization instruments available in currency unions such as capital controls, government spending, fiscal deficits, and redistribution.","[Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, 361 Beacon St, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Werning, Ivan] MIT, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Farhi, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, 361 Beacon St, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",efarhi@fas.harvard.edu; iwerning@mit.edu,,,,,,,36,72,75,1,39,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Rather than impose a parametric shape, nonparametric methods are used to motivate the nonlinear form that best describes this relationship. Using data from 1929 through 2014 and controlling for the different time-series characteristics of the variables, the bias in standard errors that can be expected from correlations arising across time, and the presence of Wagner's- law-type endogeneity in the relationship running between government size and private performance, we find evidence consistent with government size peaking in its effect on private output at roughly 32 percent of GDP.","[Ferris, J.

We propose a model of optimistically irrational bidders who understand that there are possible gains and losses associated with higher bids but who may overestimate the additional probability of winning and/or underestimate the potential losses when bidding above value. These bidders may fail to discover the dominant strategy-despite the fact that the dominant strategy only requires rationality from bidders-but respond in a common sense way to out-of-equilibrium outcomes. By varying the monetary consequences of losing money in experimental auctions we observe more overbidding when the cost to losing money is low, and less overbidding when the cost is high. Our findings lend themselves to models in which less than fully rational bidders respond systematically to out-of-equilibrium incentives, and we find that our model better fits the effects of our manipulations than most of the existing models we consider.","[Georganas, Sotiris] City Univ London, Social Sci Bldg,St John St, London EC1R 0JD, England; [Levin, Dan] Ohio State Univ, 1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [McGee, Peter] Univ Arkansas, Business Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",City University London; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"McGee, P (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Business Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",pmcgee@walton.uark.edu,,"McGee, Peter/0000-0002-1059-9286",NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant,"We are grateful to participants at the ESA Ft.

At the same time companies crave for the same pool of demand, and in fact the money held by the buyers. Attempts to define the notion of competitiveness of the company appear frequently in scientific publications and in the research conducted by various institutions in different countries. The concept of competitiveness is used to determine the ratio of enterprise characteristics to these of its competitors, resulting from many internal features and the ability to deal with an external environment. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this article is to present results of the Company Competitiveness Barometer, conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 on a group of more than 600 Polish companies. The Barometer is a theoretical basis for the integrated model of competitiveness designed by the authors of the article. The specific objectives of this article are: to provide an overview of the research methodology, to present the results of empirical studies of more than 600 Polish companies, to create an outline of the future direction of the research on competitiveness of enterprises by means of the Company Competitiveness Barometer. Methods: The questionnaire used in the Company Competitiveness Barometer is built of 48 questions. 45 of them are related to the characteristics of the company that are affecting its competitiveness, and 3 questions are metric questions. The questionnaire can be found on the www.sensorium24.com website. Findings & Value added: The research carried out from the point of view of the company's employees, offer an opportunity to reflect and think about the competitiveness of their own organization and factors that are shaping it. The IT tool used makes it possible to compare own results with other companies participating in the survey.","[Glod, Grzegorz] Univ Econ, Katowice, Poland; [Flak, Olaf] Univ Silesia, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; University of Silesia in Katowice,"Flak, O (通讯作者)，Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Radio & Televis, Ul Swietego Pawla 3, PL-40008 Katowice, Poland.",olaf.flak@us.edu.pl,"Glod, Grzegorz/Q-6993-2019; Głód, Grzegorz/S-7485-2018; Flak, Olaf/AAP-2450-2021",,,,,,26,3,3,0,17,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Because migration is always a multicausal phenomenon, this study aims to disentangle the impact of environmental factors from other migration-inducing factors to shed some light on the complex relationship between the environment and migration. Thus, we conducted quantitative microlevel studies in low-lying communities in two high-mobility countries-Ghana and Indonesia-that are particularly exposed to coastal hazards like erosion, land subsidence, storm surges and an increasing sea level, and are prone to flooding on a regular basis. Different measures of environmental threats were collected, ranging from individual perceptions over the household's distance to the coast to expert opinions. We analyzed the relationships using logistic regressions and controlled for contextual factors on multiple levels. No statistically significant direct impacts of slow-onset environmental events on migration decisions could be detected. Perceptions of storms, a clearly sudden-onset event, however, were found to be significantly linked to out-migration decisions in Ghana. These findings support the hypothesis that environmental factors are generally not a primary cause of migration, and their effects are rather context specific-especially for slow-onset changes.

We use a panel dataset of Chinese listed companies covering 2007 to 2013 to assess the effects of tax incentives on firm R & D expenditures and analyze how institutional conditions shape these effects. Our results show that tax incentives motivate R & D expenditures for our sample firms. A 10% reduction in R & D user costs leads firms to increase R & D expenditures by 3.97% in the short run. We also find considerable effect heterogeneity: Tax incentives significantly stimulate R & D in private firms but have little influence on state-owned enterprises' R & D expenditures. Moreover, the effects of tax incentives are more pronounced for private firms without political connections. Hence, reducing political intervention complements tax incentives' capacity to foster firm R & D in developing countries.","[Jia, Junxue; Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Ma, GR (通讯作者)，Mingde Main Bldg 831,59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",grma@ruc.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71533006, 71673279]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71533006 & 71673279).,,59,47,51,14,138,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

The modeling strategy is necessary to account for the Chinese labor market conditions. When choosing the components, we pay special attention to the reliability of Chinese data by avoiding the variables that are likely subject to government manipulation or mismeasurement. Comparisons of the CBCI and official indicators show discrepancies before 2009 and consistency afterwards, supporting the argument that Chinese official data improve markedly after 2008. An out-of-sample prediction justifies the usefulness of the CBCI in forecasting the private sector's perception of the business conditions.","[Liu, Ping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Cooperat & Dev Hong Kong M, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hueng, C.

Estimating the economic returns to party membership in the labor market in China,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Chinese communist party membership; Economic returns; Wage premium; Chinese labor market; Political capital; Social capital,PROPENSITY-SCORE; URBAN CHINA; MORTALITY; INCOME; REGIME,"Many studies have found that Chinese Communist party membership brings economic benefits to party members, but some studies also argue that the premium associated with party membership is merely due to members' higher levels of ability and advantageous family backgrounds. The lack of consensus on the economic returns of party membership implies that the role of party membership is not well understood. This study estimates the economic returns to Chinese Communist party membership using complementary approaches to address the endogeneity of party membership status: propensity score matching and instrumental variable. Although the magnitudes of these estimates vary across estimators, all the estimates show positive economic returns to party membership. This paper also examines possible mechanisms for how party membership may bring benefits to members and provides evidence that party membership may generate political capital, but not social capital in the labor market in China.

Unlike most previous studies, seven different ICT variables are used to consttuct a comprehensive ICT development index (IDI) that captures the access, use, and skill aspects of the technology. The results indicate that ICT development has significant positive contributions to the growth of international trade in seven (of ten) service items. For two of these - financial and other business services - both exports and imports are significantly impacted by ICT. It also has significant positive effects only on exports of transportation services and only on imports of insurance services, royalty and license fees, telecommunication services, and travel. Five of these services are ICT-enabled: this technology plays an important role in the production and delivery of these services. When we consider total (exports plus imports) trade, ICT has significant positive effects on six of the items, including financial services, insurance services, other business services, royalty and license fees, transportation and travel. Among the three aspects, ICT use is found to be more important than access and skills for trade in a number of services. These results provide interesting policy insights for ICT development and growth of services trade. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The fundamental question in evacuation modeling is to explore the complex evacuation decision-making process leading to an individual's decision to evacuate or not during a hurricane threat. Recent studies suggest that the social network characteristics of individuals could potentially determine overall evacuation patterns. This study explores the joint evacuation decisions of individuals in personal networks by using ego-centric social network data obtained from Hurricane Sandy and by considering the nested structure of the ego-centric network data, i.e. close contacts (alters) as nested within an individual (ego). In this regard, the study develops a multinomial multilevel model of joint evacuation decisions at the dyadic (ego-alter tie) level utilizing a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) approach. Model estimation results suggest factors that define a social tie (contact frequency, discussion topic and geographic proximity) significantly influence the evacuation decisions between individuals and their social partners. In addition, individuals' (both ego and alter) own socio-demographics such as age, marital status, previous evacuation experience, evacuation order, household's type, size, location and proximity to a water body also affect the decision to evacuate. These findings are useful to help emergency managers implement efficient evacuation strategies and to facilitate planning by policymakers by determining fractions of people evacuating or not for a major hurricane within the context of their social networks.","[Sadri, Arif Mohaimin; Ukkusuri, Satish V.] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Gladwin, Hugh] Florida Int Univ, Dept Global & Sociocultural Studies, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Sadri, AM (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sadri.buet@gmail.com; sukkusur@purdue.edu; gladwin@fiu.edu,"Ukkusuri, Satish/JXM-5723-2024","Sadri, Arif Mohaimin/0000-0001-5571-6741","National Science Foundation [CMMI-1131503, CMMI-1322088]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors are grateful to National Science Foundation for the Grant CMMI-1131503 to support the research presented in this paper.

The setting is in Anhui Province, China in the thirteenth to twentieth centuries. Over this period, key changes occurred in the civil service examination system, providing a means to test whether incentives for acquiring education influenced fertility decisions. I form an intergenerationally linked dataset from over 43,000 individuals from all social strata to examine the evidence for a child quantity-quality tradeoff. First, as the civil service examination system became more predictable and less discretionary starting in the seventeenth century, raising the return to human capital, I find evidence that households with a lower number of children had a higher chance that one of their sons would participate in the state examinations. This finding is robust to accounting for differences in resources, health, parental human capital, and demographic characteristics. Importantly, the finding is not limited to a small subset of rich households but present in the sample as a whole. Second, the negative relationship between fertility and education disappeared as the lower chance to become an official during the nineteenth century implied a decline in the return to human capital. Taken together, my findings support the hypothesis that fertility choices respond to changes in the return to human capital.","[Shiue, Carol H.] Univ Colorado, CESifo, CEPR, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Shiue, Carol H.] Univ Colorado, NBER, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Shiue, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, CESifo, CEPR, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Shiue, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, NBER, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",shiue@colorado.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017","SHIUE, CAROL/0000-0003-1890-318X",Russell Sage Foundation; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R03 HD042731-01],Russell Sage Foundation; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Thanks to the editor, four referees, Sascha Becker, Steve Broadberry, Raquel Fernandez, Avner Greif, Bishnupriya Gupta, Murat Iyigun, Wolfgang Keller, Omer Moav, Tom Rawski, Ted Telford, Michele Tertilt, and Nathan Sussman, as well as audiences at University of California-Davis, Fudan University, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Mannheim, University of Montreal, McGill, Northwestern, Oxford, Warwick, the Asian Historical Economics Conference, the NBER Development of the American Economy, the NBER Economic Fluctuations and Growth, and the Stanford SITE Conference for useful comments.

Using a dataset of 63 Vietnamese provinces for the period of 2005-2013, the present study attempts to investigate how these two dimensions serve to promote private investment in Vietnam. The two-step system Generalized Method of Moments contributes to clarifying the nonlinearity of the relationship between provincial government size and private investment growth. Furthermore, the threshold effect of government size varies across provinces due to differences in provincial governance quality, and provinces with a high quality of local governance have the potential to raise the threshold level of government size. Additionally, several aspects of local public governance such as entry cost, legal system, transparency, and biased policy are found to have significant associations with private investment, whereas others are not. The results show that advancing public governance remains a big challenge for Vietnam's private sector development policies. Changes in public governance quality are, therefore, crucial to improve the effects of government size on private investment.","[Thanh Dinh Su; Thi Mai Hoai Bui] Univ Econ, Fac Publ Finance, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Su, TD (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Publ Finance, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu St,Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",dinhthanh@ueh.edu.vn,"Su Dinh, Thanh/Q-3915-2019","Su Dinh, Thanh/0000-0003-2344-6315",,,,,110,23,25,0,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

First, we identify a significantly positive effect of bribes on firm profitability only for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). Further empirical analysis shows that this positive effect mainly exists in less contract-intensive industries and simple goods industries. Then we find that corruption functions as protection money for non-SOEs by showing that bribes can lower effective tax rates. We further show that bribes can help non-state firms circumvent red tape and increase their probability of obtaining government procurement contracts, thus validating the grease money hypothesis. Our results suggest that both effects of corruption exist for non-SOEs in China, thereby identifying a new profit-enhancing factor in the non-state sector in recent years.","[Xu, Gang; Yano, Go] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Zhang, Dongyang] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Zhangjialukou 121, Beijing 10070, Peoples R China",Kyoto University; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Xu, G (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;Zhang, DY (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Zhangjialukou 121, Beijing 10070, Peoples R China.",xgdl2005@hotmail.com; zhangdongyang@cueb.edu.cn; rswtj922@yahoo.co.jp,"XU, GANG/HOC-7479-2023; YANO, Go/AAH-4186-2019","XU, GANG/0000-0002-7480-156X; YANO, Go/0000-0002-0187-627X; ZHANG, DONGYANG/0000-0002-4053-8476","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture of Japan (MESSC) [17K03683]; Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Fund [17LJC008]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K03683] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture of Japan (MESSC)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Beijing Philosophy and Social Science Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Hisaki Kono, Fumiharu Mieno, Souksavanh Vixathep and other participants at the Asian Economic Development Seminar for their insightful comments.

Using a structural Interacted Vector Autoregressive (IVAR) model conditional on high and low levels of U.S. economic policy uncertainty, we find that uncertainty regarding policy changes in the U.S. dampens the effect of monetary policy shocks in the Euro area, with both price and output reacting more significantly to monetary policy shocks when the level of U.S. policy uncertainty is low. We argue that the U.S. government's actions regarding policy changes in the U.S. is a source of uncertainty for Euro area investors and high levels of policy uncertainty that spill over from the U.S. drive Euro area investors to adopt a wait -and -see approach, leading to a relatively weaker (and sometimes insignificant) response of price and output to monetary tightening in the Euro area. The findings underscore the importance of market integration and coordination of economic policy changes on the effectiveness of monetary policy on the macroeconomy on both sides of the Atlantic.

The heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a strong precautionary motive.

Areas in the United States with declining labor demand and incomes due to increasing import competition from China experience relative declines in housing prices and business activity. Since local governments are disproportionately funded through property and sales taxation, declining property values and a decrease in economic activity translate into less revenue, which constrains the ability of local governments to provide public services. State and federal governments have limited ability to smooth local shocks, and the impact on the provision of public services is compounded when local income shocks are highly correlated with shocks in the rest of the state.

We analyze the relationship between firms' R&D investment-price decisions and governments' R&D policies. We find that an increase in the process (product) R&D investment subsidy of the CRC (QIC) raises the process (product) R&D investment of its firm, but reduces the product (process) R&D investment of its rival firm, and vice versa. We also show that, while an increase in the process (product) R&D investment of the CRC's (QIC's) firm increases its output, it decreases its rival's output, and vice versa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, while an increase in the process R&D investment of the CRC's firm reduces the prices of both firms, an increase in the product R&D investment of the QIC's firm raises its own price, but reduces its rival's, and vice versa. Finally, we find that the optimal R&D investment policies of both countries are subsidy policies, when their firms act under asymmetrical R&D investment rivalry.","[Ishii, Yasunori] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 169805, Japan",Waseda University,"Ishii, Y (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 169805, Japan.",yishii@waseda.jp,,,,,,,24,1,1,1,24,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

The instruments examined are filing fees or subsidies that may be imposed on either party, damage awards and payments by Unsuccessful plaintiffs (each of which may be decoupled), and the stringency of the evidence threshold (burden of proof). With no constraints, results arbitrarily close to the first best can be implemented. Prior analyses of optimal damage awards, decoupling, and fee shifting are shown to involve special cases. More important, previous results change qualitatively when implicit assumptions are relaxed. For example, introducing a filing fee can make it optimal to minimize what losing plaintiffs pay winning defendants and to reduce the evidence threshold as much as possible even though the direct effect of these adjustments is to chill desirable behavior, a key feature absent in prior work.

Overall, we find that exporting has a significant positive effect on the (absolute value of the) unconditional wage elasticity of labour demand.

A recurring debate in the literature is whether resource rich countries benefit in the form of higher sustained growth rates or not from the export of their natural resources. Canada's Harold Innis wrote extensively on this subject over 80 years ago and argued for the no side in the debate. Was he was right or wrong? I begin with the foundations of natural resource theory then turn to empirical work in recent decades. I agree with the literature that Canada overall has benefited from the export of its natural resources, but question whether that can continue given the focus on short term growth and the failure to account for the social costs of resource extraction and usethe environmental externalities that degrade and reduce stocks of natural capital. These externalities increasingly threaten our water and land resources and without more effective policy, the ability of resources to sustain growth and well-being is questionable. Was Innis wrong? Yes in that the evidence supports the counter argumentresources have helped Canada become a developed economy with relatively high incomes and sustained growth rates. Innis was right that the uneven distribution of resources causes different impacts regionally especially during booms and busts and recognized the need to find substitutes for declining and degrading resource stocks. But Innis, like many after him, focused more on the intrinsic features of natural resources than policy to address the social costs of their development, a legacy that leaves us in a precarious position today.","[Olewiler, Nancy] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Olewiler, N (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",olewiler@sfu.ca,,,,,,,51,3,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

In these surveys, the amount of wage is reported by the respondents themselves: thus, the explanatory variable of the econometric models may differ from the true wage people earn. Our paper shows that the use of survey data can lead to considerable over-estimation of the importance of wage as a determinant of wage satisfaction. In particular, responses seem to be affected by a recall bias: people who are satisfied with their wage are more likely to over-report their wage in questionnaires. The more satisfied they are the more they over-report (and vice versa unsatisfied people). We name this behavioral disposition hedonic recall bias. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The crisis triggered widespread, yet ongoing revisions of the beliefs entertained by agents and economists. The decision errors that result in crises do not necessarily derive from behavioral biases: often, those choices were rationalized with reference to established conventional wisdom, backed by economic theories influential at the respective times. Thus, understanding such socially relevant events requires addressing concretely how people build decision scenarios in changing environments, and how those interact with the evolution of prevalent economic analysis. A revision of Keynes' work on uncertainty, especially his notion of weight of evidence, can help in this respect. In this paper we analyze some central informational elements of macro crises, discuss weaknesses of the standard analyses which try to accommodate critical phenomena into the rational expectations framework, and comment on ways to move ahead.","[Schiaffino, Pablo] Univ Torcuato Tella, Ave Pres Figueroa Alcorta 7350,C1428BCW, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Crespo, Ricardo F.] IAE Univ Austral, Guido 1724,CAAF1016, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Crespo, Ricardo F.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Guido 1724,CAAF1016, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Heymann, Daniel] Univ Buenos Aires, IIEP, BAIRES, CONICET, Ave Cordoba 2122,C1120AAQ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Heymann, Daniel] Univ San Andres, Ave Cordoba 2122,C1120AAQ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella; Austral University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Universidad de San Andres Argentina,"Crespo, RF (通讯作者)，IAE Univ Austral, Guido 1724,CAAF1016, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Crespo, RF (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Guido 1724,CAAF1016, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",plschiaffino@gmail.com; rcrespo@iae.edu.ar; dheymann@econ.uba.ar,"Crespo, Ricardo/AAF-3880-2020",,,,,,61,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

However, in recent years, as tariff levels have fallen, China has sought to implement other protectionist mechanisms. The use of non-tariff measures has added another dimension to international trade activities that need to be better understood. The paper analyses the impacts that two forms of non-tariff measures, technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, have on Korean exports to China. To measure the impacts, we use an adapted version of the gravity model and the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood method. The results show that Chinese sanitary and phytosanitary measures, estimated using both the coverage ratio and the frequency index, have positive correlations with Korean agricultural exports; however, Chinese TBT measures, when estimated by the coverage ratio, were found to depress Korean manufacturing exports and exports as a whole. However, using the frequency index, Chinese TBT measures were found to have a statistically insignificant negative impact on Korean exports to China.","[Wood, Jacob; Wu, Jie; Li, Yilin] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Jungsuk] Sogang Univ, Inst Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Chungnam National University; Sogang University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Inst Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",iias7@sogang.ac.kr,"Wu, Jie/HTO-9127-2023; Wood, Jacob/ISV-4680-2023; Kim, Jungsuk/S-8614-2017","Wu, Jie/0000-0001-6162-8414; Kim, Jungsuk/0000-0002-5574-1303; Wood, Jacob/0000-0002-3096-5159",,,,,30,13,13,4,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

We performed what we believe is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of these models, leveraging ten datasets from the literature recording human play of two-player games. We first evaluated predictive performance, asking how well each model fits unseen test data using parameters calibrated from separate training data. The QLk model (Stahl and Wilson, 1994) consistently achieved the best performance. Using a Bayesian analysis, we found that QLk's estimated parameter values were not consistent with their intended economic interpretations. Finally, we evaluated model variants similar to QLk, identifying one (Camerer et al., 2016) that achieves better predictive performance with fewer parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However well-intentioned, the policy will distort the gasoline market with the resulting inefficiencies. Furthermore, the gasoline subsidy takes a great amount of government's budget. Arguably, these funds could be spent elsewhere with a greater impact on economic growth. These governments are aware of the cost of such a policy, yet face difficulties in removing the policy because of strong resistance from the public. This paper looks at the unique case of Indonesia that only provides a subsidy for regular gasoline and in turn proposes an alternative policy that introduces a subsidy for premium gasoline at a lower rate to reduce the overall gasoline subsidy cost. There has yet to be any research that simulates price controls for gasoline with different grades. The aggregate demand for gasoline in Indonesia is replicated using a translog cost calibration approach. Simulations based on the calibrated demand are then performed and the results confirm the existence of potential savings that are largely determined by the cross-price elasticities between regular and premium gasoline. The benchmark scenario, based on a recent study of substitutability between gasoline by grades, results in an 11.5% reduction in subsidy cost of around 950 million USD with a subsidy rate of Rp 2254/liter. Furthermore, the optimal rate of subsidy for premium gasoline results in a reduction of inefficiency as consumers' welfare increase by 6.8 trillion rupiahs (or 560 million USD).

We find that, when auctioning simultaneously, clock auctions outperform sealed-bid auctions in terms of efficiency and revenues. This advantage disappears when the items are auctioned sequentially.

We find that Christian-conservative members of the German parliament from constituencies with higher shares of Protestants were more likely to vote against a third bailout for Greece. Survey data show that views on the euro differ between German Protestants and non-Protestants at the individual level, too. Among Protestants, concerns about the euro have, compared to non-Protestants, increased during the crisis. We show that this increase in concern is linked to a reduction of Protestants' subjective well-being. We use the timing of survey interviews and news events in 2011 to account for the endogeneity of euro concerns. Emphasis on moral hazard concerns in Protestant theology may, thus, still shape economic preferences.","[Chadi, Adrian] IAAEU Trier Univ, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Krapf, Matthias] Univ Basel, WWZ Wirtschaftswissensch Fak, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Chadi, A (通讯作者)，IAAEU Trier Univ, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",chadi@iaaeu.de; matthias.krapf@unibas.ch,,"Krapf, Matthias/0000-0003-0171-7356",,,,,63,9,9,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Regions facing larger tariff cuts experienced prolonged declines in formal sector employment and earnings relative to other regions. The impact of tariff changes on regional earnings 20 years after liberalization was three times the effect after 10 years. These increasing effects on regional earnings are inconsistent with conventional spatial equilibrium models, which predict declining effects due to spatial arbitrage. We investigate potential mechanisms, finding empirical support for a mechanism involving imperfect interregional labor mobility and dynamics in labor demand, driven by slow capital adjustment and agglomeration economies. This mechanism gradually amplifies the effects of liberalization, explaining the slow adjustment path of regional earnings and quantitatively accounting for the magnitude of the long-run effects.","[Dix-Carneiro, Rafael] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 210A Social Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Kovak, Brian K.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, 4800 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Duke University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Dix-Carneiro, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 210A Social Sci Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",rafael.dix.carneiro@duke.edu; bkovak@cmu.edu,,,W.

To develop such understanding we model a general equilibrium labor-search framework that incorporates on-the-job (OTJ) search and distinctly accounts for the differential impact of TFP and financial shocks. Surprisingly, we find that the interaction of OTJ search with financial shocks is sufficiently different from its interaction with TFP shocks so that, under standard calibrations, our model generates aggregate dynamics exceedingly in line with the behavior of key U.S. macro data across several decades and in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) as well. Importantly, as in the data, the model yields relatively high volatilities of consumption, labor income, and unemployment. As such, our work contributes to resolving two limitations of current general equilibrium labor-search theory: under standard calibrations and amid TFP shocks, only, models without OTJ search generate implausibly low unemployment volatility, while models with OTJ search generate unemployment volatility closer to the data but at the expense of implausibly low consumption and labor-income volatility.

In 1998, the allocation of a formula based grant in Spain switched from using the centrally administered census to local population registers administered by municipalities. The value of this per capita grant changes at fixed population thresholds for the entire local population. We exploit these notches to analyze the size distribution of municipalities to detect deliberate manipulation of the grant-assignment variable. This allows us to causally identify the effect of grant generosity on population over-reporting. We document an excess mass of municipalities to the right of the notch threshold and a density hole to the left of it: local registers included a proportion of 'ghost citizens', that is, people who presented no trace of actually residing in the municipalities which benefit the most from inflating population figures to pass the relevant threshold. We document that manipulation (rather than real population responses) is the mechanism at work. The main channel behind manipulation is the incorrect treatment of foreign residents to inflate total local population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

When property rights are strong and districts are in charge of extracting their own resources to get revenues, conservation in one district benefits the others since the reduced supply raises the sales price. A central authority would internalize this positive externality and thus conserve more. When property rights are instead weak and extraction is illegal or costly control, conservation in one district increases the price and thus the profit from illegally depleting the resource in the other districts. The externality from conservation is then negative, and centralization would lead to less conservation. We also derive the optimal conservation contract, and we explain when the principal, who values conservation, benefits from contracting with the districts directly even when contracting with a central authority would have led to more conservation, and vice versa.","[Harstad, Bard; Mideksa, Torben K.] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Harstad, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",,,,,,,,84,18,18,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In deciding what supply to offer, generators need to form judgements on the supplies chosen by rivals and hence the residual demand they face. Many markets are found to have prices above competitive levels, which could be explained by Nash-Cournot behaviour or marking-up above variable costs, but these strategies may not be robust against sophisticated deviants. This paper demonstrates that (1) the Nash choice of the optimal proportional mark-up on marginal costs yields lower prices and profits than Cournot behaviour but higher prices and profits than the optimum fixed mark-up; (2) such mark-up models are robust to single firm Nash deviations, but not against more sophisticated deviations in the deterministic case, nor under demand uncertainty. Proportional mark-up models emerge as the most robust and hence preferred modeling approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Formal enforcement mechanisms rely on monetary or other tangible incentives while social enforcement mechanisms rely on some form of social judgment involving informal sanctions. We experimentally investigate the extent to which social observability and the possibility of social judgment affect individuals' decisions to engage in corruption at the expense of others. We are also interested in the degree to which culture matters. We use a laboratory experiment with a sample of individuals who live in the U.S. but are also characterized by cultural heterogeneity due to the immigration of their ancestors to the U.S. We find that the possibility of social judgment reduces corruption only among individuals who identify culturally with countries characterized by low levels of corruption. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of social enforcement mechanisms is at least partly dependent on the sociocultural norms prevailing in the target population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This can be done with carefully designed exercises or assignments that contrast mainstream and heterodox models, service learning experiences that ground students in real-world experiences, or the construction of course, curriculum and textbook designs that juxtapose mainstream and heterodox theories and ideas in sophisticated ways. We outline the major contributions of this symposium to the literature on teaching heterodox economics. Those summaries are followed by descriptions of some approaches we use in our own courses that promote sophisticated critical thinking in a multi-paradigmatic, discovery-based setting.

We consider a two-stage model where there is a two-party competition over the tax rate and over the intensity of the tax enforcement policy in the first stage, and voters decide about their level of tax compliance in the second stage. We find that if the concern about fairness in tax compliance is high enough, a liberal middle-income majority of voters may block any income redistribution policy. Alternatively, we find an equilibrium in which the preferences of the median voter are ignored in favor of a coalition formed by a group of relatively poor voters and the richest voters. In this equilibrium income redistribution prevails with no tax enforcement.","[Solano-Garcia, Angel] Univ Granada, Dept Teori & Hist Econ, Granada 18011, Spain",University of Granada,"Solano-Garcia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Teori & Hist Econ, Granada 18011, Spain.",asolano@ugr.es,"Solano Garcia, Angel/H-3179-2017","Solano Garcia, Angel/0000-0001-7010-6212","Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-44879-R, ECO 2014-57673-REDT]",Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"I would like to thank Enriqueta Aragones, Humberto Llavador, Santiago Sanchez-Pages, Socorro Puy, and Ascension Andina for their helpful comments.

The paper postulates the conceptually useful allegory of a futuristic World Climate Assembly' (WCA) that votes for a single worldwide price on carbon emissions via the basic democratic principle of one person, one vote majority rule. A WCA-like uniform price-tax counters self-interest by incentivizing countries or agents to internalize the externality because each WCA agent's higher abatement cost from a higher emissions price is counterbalanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other WCA agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price. The paper derives fresh insights and new simple formulae that relate each emitter's most-preferred world price of carbon to the world social cost of carbon' (SCC), and further relates the WCA-voted world price of carbon to the world SCC. Some implications are discussed. The overall methodology of the paper is a mixture of mostly classical with some behavioural economics.","[Weitzman, Martin L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Weitzman, ML (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,34,18,18,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2017,84.0,336,,,,,559,586,,10.1111/ecca.12248,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FF3OI,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408815800001,0

Moreover, the multiple priors decision maker of these models will eventually learn the truth. To accommodate nonvanishing violations of Savage's (The foundations of statistics, Wiley, New York, 1954) sure-thing principle, as reported in Nicholls et al. (J Risk Uncertain 50:97-115, 2015), we construct and analyze a model of Bayesian learning with multiple priors for which ambiguity does not necessarily vanish in an one-urn environment. Our decision maker only forms posteriors from priors that survive a prior selection rule which discriminates, with probability one, against priors whose expected Kullback-Leibler divergence from the truth is too far off from the minimal expected Kullback-Leibler divergence over all priors. The stubbornness parameter of our prior selection rule thereby governs how much ambiguity will remain in the limit of our learning model.","[Zimper, Alexander] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Zimper, Alexander] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Ma, Wei] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wei] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; University of Pretoria,"Zimper, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.;Zimper, A (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",alexander.zimper@up.ac.za; Wei.Ma@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Zimper, Alexander/KBQ-4867-2024","Zimper, Alexander/0000-0002-3730-3086",ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa),ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa),"We thank Larry Epstein, Massimo Marinacci, Daniele Pennesi, an anonymous referee, and especially Jan Werner for helpful comments and suggestions.

We document this novel pattern across developing countries, and build a simple model of the State as a self-enforcing social contract, which illustrates how power, and institutions that constrain or complement it, affect development. We show a tradeoff between the two facets of power enforcement and expropriation. As the ruler's power grows, his temptation to shirk on enforcement diminishes while the temptation to expropriate grows. Consequently, private enforcement optimally evolves into State enforcement. Moreover, faster courts relax the ruler's incentive constraint on enforcement but tighten his non-expropriation incentive constraint; thus, the effect on development depends on which incentive constraint binds in equilibrium. Our results are consistent with the observed cross-country patterns and with historical evidence on transition from the Law Merchant enforcement system to the State.","[Aldashev, Gani] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, 42 Ave Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Aldashev, Gani] Univ Namur, CRED, 42 Ave Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Zanarone, Giorgio] Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros CUNEF, Calle Leonardo Prieto Castro 2, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Namur; CUNEF Universidad,"Aldashev, G (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, 42 Ave Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Aldashev, G (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, CRED, 42 Ave Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",gani.aldashev@ulb.ac.be; gzanarone@cunef.edu,"Zanarone, Giorgio/K-4513-2014","Aldashev, Gani/0000-0002-8834-9076; Zanarone, Giorgio/0000-0003-0226-9188",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-57131-R],Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Robert Gibbons for extensive advice and suggestions.

Moreover, unemployment increases in tandem with declining trust toward national and European political institutions, though we find only weak or no effects of unemployment on interpersonal trust. The correlation between unemployment and attitudes toward immigrants is muted, especially for their cultural impact. To explore causality, we extract the component of increases in unemployment explained by the precrisis structure of the economy, in particular the share of construction in regional value added, which is strongly related both to the buildup preceding and the bursting of the crisis.

This shift has been associated with an expanding welfare state and left-wing dominance. However, the pattern is far from uniform and while some left-wing governments indeed expanded consumption taxation, others did not. This paper seeks to explain why, by exploring how experts influenced post-war tax policy in Britain and Sweden. Experts infl uence is crucial when explaining how the left began to see consumption tax not as a threat but as an opportunity. Interestingly, the infl uence of experts such as Nicholas Kaldor in Britain was different from the impact of Swedish experts (e.g. Gsta Rehn). I make the argument that the impact of expert advice is contingent on the political risks facing governments. The low risks facing the Swedish Left made it more amenable to the advantages of broad-based sales taxes, while the high-risk environment in Britain made Labour reject these ideas.","[Andersson, Per F.] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, PF (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lund, Sweden.",per.andersson@svet.lu.se,,"Andersson, Per/0000-0002-0507-6931",,,,,52,1,1,0,3,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We study expectation formation near the zero lower bound using a learning-to-forecast laboratory experiment under alternative policy regimes. In our experimental economy, monetary policy targets inflation around a constant or state-dependent target. We find that subjects' expectations significantly over-react to stochastic aggregate demand shocks and historical information, leading many economies to experience severe deflationary traps. Neither quantitatively nor qualitatively communicating the state-dependent inflation targets reduce the duration or severity of economic crises. Introducing anticipated and persistent fiscal stimulus at the zero lower bound reduces the severity of the recessions. When the recovery of fundamentals is sufficiently slow, participants' expectations become highly pessimistic and neither monetary nor fiscal policy are effective at stabilizing the economy.

When programs such as Medicare and Medicaid were introduced in the 1960s, the government directly reimbursed medical providers for the care that they provided, through a classic single payer system. Since the mid-1980s, however, there has been an evolution towards a model where the government subsidizes enrollees who choose among privately provided insurance options. In the United States, privatized delivery of public health insurance appears to be here to stay, with debates now focused on how much to expand its reach. Yet such privatized delivery raises a variety of thorny issues. Will choice among private insurance options lead to adverse selection and market failures in privatized insurance markets? Can individuals choose appropriately over a wide range of expensive and confusing plan options? Will a privatized approach deliver the promised increases in delivery efficiency claimed by advocates? What policy mechanisms have been used, or might be used, to address these issues? A growing literature in health economics has begun to make headway on these questions. In this essay, I discuss that literature and the lessons for both economics more generally and health care policymakers more specifically.","[Gruber, Jonathan] MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gruber, Jonathan] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gruber, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Gruber, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gruberj@mit.edu,,,,,,,54,19,32,1,27,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The emerging consensus in India appears to be that, far from being exclusively an economic and infrastructure development program, the BRI may be understood as a long-term strategic initiative that seeks to convert China's current economic might into diplomatic influence. While attempts have been made by Beijing, the reflexive Indian suspicion of Chinese international projection, including of China's BRI, has not yet been met by a coherent discourse designed to specifically address Indian concerns. In contrast, in Pakistan, widespread acceptance of the importance and necessity of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is increasingly coupled with concerns within sectors of Pakistani society over the fairness, transparency and eventual economic outcomes of the project.

However, the rise of evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) puts into question the monopoly of Darwinism in evolutionary biology. The major divergences between the two paradigms in evolutionary biology are drawn in the analysis of three trade-offs: population vs. typological thinking, creative role of natural selection vs. internal (inherent) change, and microevolution vs. macroevolution. It is argued here that the Evo-Devo breakthrough helps us to understand better the limits to Darwinism in the social realm and outline the contours of an alternative paradigm in evolutionary economics that favors structural macroevolution and what Schumpeter called change from within.","[Liagouras, George] Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece",University of Aegean,"Liagouras, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Chios, Greece.",g.liagouras@fme.aegean.gr,,"Liagouras, George/0000-0002-4410-2741",,,,,103,5,6,0,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Our results show that (a) on average, output tariff reductions tend to reduce firm entry rate and increase firm exit rate, while input tariff reductions help to increase both firm entry rate and exit rate, furthermore, regional marketization strengthens the impact of trade liberalization on firm dynamics; (b) trade liberalization exerts greater impact on the likelihood of exit for the least productive firms while it tends to reduce the probability of exit for the more productive firms, with regional marketization strengthening such a reallocation process of trade liberalization; (c) firm dynamics effect contributes approximately 43% of the growth of productivity, and it (especially the firm exit effect) is an important channel through which trade liberalization fosters productivity growth, and domestic market reform is found to strengthen such an impact.","[Mao, Qilin; Sheng, Bin] Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Inst Int Econ, 94,Weijin Rd, Tianjin 30071, Peoples R China",Nankai University,"Sheng, B (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Inst Int Econ, 94,Weijin Rd, Tianjin 30071, Peoples R China.",maoqilin@nankai.edu.cn; shengbin@nankai.edu.cn,,,Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA057]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403135]; Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [16YJC790114]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20177100056],Major Projects of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"We would like to thank the editor and three anonymous referees for their very helpful comments and suggestions which substantially improve the paper.

We find that the rate of absorption of technical knowledge from imported Japanese products was lower than that of imported US products. Seven countries that imported more from Japan than the US during the period 1994-2011 experienced a decrease in output efficiency, four countries changed their pattern of imports from Japan in favor of the US, and the two countries that retained a high level of US imports attained a high level of efficiency. The countries using US technical knowledge comprise a frontier country and catching -up countries, while the remaining countries using Japanese technical knowledge could not catch up to the frontier country. These findings suggest that during Japan's Lost Two Decades, Japanese technical knowledge fell out of favor in line with Japanese imports. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It turns out that, generally, labour productivity does not cause output. In more cases, the causation seems to be running in the opposite direction: from output to productivity. This finding, though inconsistent with the mainstream ideas on the sources of long-term economic growth, is reminiscent of the classical Kaldor-Verdoorn Law. The progressing slowdown in output growth on the global level, initiated around the mid-1970s (when the process of discarding the earlier economic policy paradigms set in), may have been mirrored by the progressing slowdown in productivity growth (and that despite the hardly disputable acceleration of technological progress).","[Podkaminer, Leon] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Podkaminer, L (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Vienna, Austria.",podkaminer@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,13,8,8,0,13,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Then, we test the hypothesis that the presence of one key inventor in a firm's R&D laboratory would have a positive effect on the Italian firms output. Our results are threefold: 1) the patent portfolio positively affects the value of production; 2) the simple presence of key inventors in a R&D laboratory does not significantly affect the output; 3) for a given number of patent applications by firm, a less concentrated patents distribution across inventors employed in the same R&D laboratory makes a positive impact on the production.

When taxes are levied ad valorem rather than per-unit firstly, we find the interaction between both types of externalities is more ambiguous than commonly understood. As a result, and contrary to earlier findings, fiscal equalisation mechanisms such as the representative transfer system (RTS) fail to fully internalise the tax externalities. Given these limitations, we derive the conditions under which a standard RTS will either: (1) at least nudge politicians in the right direction; (2) realise no welfare gains at all; (3) considerably overshoot the second-best efficiency mark causing welfare loss. Lastly, we find that when taxation is residence-based rather than source-based, a different kind of competition emerges where tax cuts are aimed at stimulating outward factor flows, rather than attracting inward flows.","[Sas, Willem] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Sas, W (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",Willem.sas@kuleuven.be,"Sas, Willem/JFA-6990-2023",,BELSPO [TA/00/39]; Steunpunt beleidsrelevant Onderzoek Fiscaliteit en Begroting,BELSPO(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Steunpunt beleidsrelevant Onderzoek Fiscaliteit en Begroting,"This is a revised version of a chapter of my PhD dissertation.

In the proposed model, we allow the coefficient on the oil price index to be a time-varying function which evolves over time in a way that is assumed to be unknown. We also allow the common trend function to evolve over time, as well as extending the model further to incorporate country-specific trend functions. We employ a data-driven local linear method to estimate these time-varying trend and coefficient functions. The results show that, despite being largely positive, there are several downward trends, reflecting the aftermath of the Iraq war and the recent unprecedented drop in the oil price. Overall, we find that the nonparametric panel data model better captures the way in which the underlying stock-oil price relationship has evolved over time in comparison to the point estimates of the parametric counterpart. Moreover, we find that stock market fundamentals play a significant role in determining the oil-stock price relationship. Our findings have important implication for policymakers and financial speculators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The directional changes in MEI and HEI are found to be inconsistent at both the sectoral and national levels. A further analysis with a LMDI index decomposition model shows that the difference between HEI LMDI and HEI LMDI is principally caused by energy prices.

We analytically show that, when monetary shocks change investors' wealth and portfolio liquidity, their degree of risk aversion associated with wealth and liquidity changes accordingly, which is then channeled to their investment decision and finally to the stock market fluctuations. Both the wealth effect and liquidity effect of monetary shocks have inter-temporal impacts on stock pricing. Therefore, monetary shocks and stock price fluctuations should be treated as a unified vector system that is auto-correlated. Based on the theoretical analysis, this paper further studies the impacts of different forms of monetary shocks on the Chinese stock market over the period 2005 to 2012 with a non-linear VAR model. We find that monetary shocks in China have significant and asymmetric effects on the stock market performance over different market cycles. Our estimation suggests that changes in monetary policy may increase stock market volatility, even though these monetary policies are often aimed at stabilizing the Chinese macro-economic activities.","[Zhang, Bo; Hu, Jinyan; Jiang, Mingming] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Guo, Feng] Peoples Bank China, Jinan Branch, 382 Jingqi Rd, Jinan 250021, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University; People's Bank of China,"Jiang, MM (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",blogzhang@hotmail.com; hwx@sdu.edu.cn; mingming.jiang@sdu.edu.cn; bryant_1108@163.com,"Jiang, Mingming/W-4776-2019; GUO, FENG/JRX-3555-2023; liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023","Jiang, Mingming/0000-0003-0779-9516;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333009, 71273155, 71503147, 71403061]; Scientific Research Foundation for ROCs; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for ROCs(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University,"We greatly appreciate the financial support of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333009, 71273155, and 71503147).

Using identical laboratory experiments conducted in the two countries, we analyze the impact on tax compliance of Full Disclosure (e.g., release of photos of tax evaders to all subjects, along with information on the extent of their noncompliance) and of Full Confidentiality (e.g., no public dissemination of photos or noncompliance). Our empirical analysis applies a two-stage strategy that separates the evasion decision into its extensive (e.g., participation) and intensive (e.g. amount) margins. We find strong support for the notion that public disclosure acts as an additional deterrent to tax evaders, and that the deterrent effect is concentrated in the first stage of the two-stage model (or whether to evade or not). We also find that the deterrent effect is similar in the U.S. and in Italy, despite what appear to be different social norms of compliance in the two countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By identifying the links between firm level variables and aggregate quantities, the paper contributes toward a reformulation of the Minskyan formal analysis that explicitly considers the role of microeconomic factors in generating macroeconomic instability. The aggregation of heterogeneous agents is not only performed numerically, as in traditional agent-based models, but also by means of an innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in statistical mechanics and recently imported into macroeconomics. The distinctive feature is in that the joint analysis of the numerical and analytical solutions of the model sheds light on the effects of financial fragility at the firm level on the dynamics of the macroeconomy. In particular, the analysis of steady-state and stability properties of the system provide additional insights on the role of behavioral and size heterogeneity of firms for the stocks of aggregate debt and capital.

As disinflation and deflation push up the real interest rate, while growth and income declines, the leveraging problem becomes more severe and the economy risks shifting into a regime with high insolvency risk, high financial stress, rising credit spreads, possibly accompanied by strong adverse macroeconomic feedback loops. Investigating the consequences of those magnifying feedback loops, given the debt-deflation, we demonstrate the possibility of unstable dynamics and downward spirals in the presence of regime-dependent macro feedback loops, using a theoretical model with decentralized matching mechanisms on both labor and financial markets. To explore the amplifying linkages between deflation, output, labor and financial markets, we employ a new solution procedure called Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to solve our models variants for out-of-steady-state dynamics. We apply a four variable Multi Regime VAR (MRVAR) model with regime dependent (generalized) impulse-response functions (GIRFs) to study deflationary and financial risk drivers empirically for Southern and Northern EU countries. New measures for financial risk drivers are employed and GIRFs for output, inflation rates, interest rates and financial stress are explored. The econometric results of the MRVAR are roughly in line with the theoretical regime change model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In our model, a group of agents contributes to a project over time, which is completed once the cumulative contributions reach a threshold. Provided that this occurs prior to a prespecified deadline, each agent receives a lump-sum payoff. We show that a shorter deadline can induce the agents to raise their efforts, but no matter the length of the deadline, effort provision is inefficient due to the agents' frontloading incentives. Only if the agents do not monitor progress until the deadline are their frontloading incentives eliminated, so by committing to a deadline equal to the first-best completion time, it is possible to restore efficiency. Recognizing that deadlines are not renegotiation proof, we show that by committing to monitor progress to date at the first-best completion time, and then again at a sufficiently later date, efficiency can be attained. In this case, that monitoring date acts as a self-enforcing deadline.

In addition, we also find that price posting dominates auctions since both mechanisms yield the same expected revenue, but the latter results in higher advertising expense.

Despite the converging roles of men and women in several labour market outcomes, the gender management gap is persistent. In this paper, we analyse the impact of children on the gender gap in management, focussing on the within-couple gap, allowing us to control for both observed and unobserved attributes of the spouse. The main findings suggest that the gender gap in management increases considerably after the arrival of the first child. Nine years after the birth of the firstborn child, the male-female gap in management has increased by approximately 5 percentage points. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that the gender gap is wider, and gets steeper over time, for couples where the father has a management education or higher education, compared to the gap for the overall sample. In households where the spouses share the parental leave and the mother returns to full-time employment after the leave, the increase in the gender management gap is much smaller, and it is no longer significant towards the end of the period.","[Hardoy, Ines; Schone, Pal; Ostbakken, Kjersti Misje] Inst Social Res, PB 3233 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway",,"Schone, P (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, PB 3233 Elisenberg, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",iha@samfunnsforskning.no; psc@samfunnsforskning.no; k.m.ostbakken@samfunnsforskning.no,,,Norwegian Research Council [236770],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This research was made possible thanks to a grant from the Norwegian Research Council, under the project Gender segregation in the labour market [project number: 236770].

In many cases, consumers may have incomplete information or may be inattentive about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy policies, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers' privacy actions and attitudes. Results of an online survey experiment indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing sensitive and identifiable information, even when positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy are made salient, compared to when privacy is not mentioned. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information. Rather, people are inattentive and their dormant privacy concerns may manifest only when consumers are asked to think about privacy. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The model is designed to target initial announcements of GDP in a mixed-frequency framework. The selected equations for each forecast horizon are consistent with the time frame of real-time nowcasting exercises: the first one includes mainly information on the expected evolution of economic activity, while the second and third equations rely more on information on observed business outcomes. The predictive accuracy of the model increases over the forecast horizon, consistent with the gradual increase in available information. Furthermore, the model outperforms a wide set of alternatives, such as its previous version and MIDAS regressions, although not a specification including also hard data. Further research should evaluate the performance of the MIBA model with respect to promising alternative approaches for nowcasting GDP (e.g. mixed-frequency factor models with targeted predictors), and consider forecast combinations and density forecasts.","[Mogliani, Matteo] Banque France Business Condit & Macroecon Forecas, DGEI DCPM SEMAP 46 1376, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France; [Darne, Olivier] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Chemin Censive Tertre BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 03, France; [Pluyaud, Bertrand] Banque France Balance Payments Directorate, DGS DBDP 43 1465, 37 Rue Louvre, F-75002 Paris, France",Nantes Universite,"Mogliani, M (通讯作者)，Banque France Business Condit & Macroecon Forecas, DGEI DCPM SEMAP 46 1376, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",matteo.mogliani@banque-france.fr; olivier.darne@univ-nantes.fr; bertrand.pluyaud@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,57,1,1,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Lawson's development of it is given meaning both by the roots of the approach in his work on social ontology and the state of economics that provides the grounds for the critique contained in that social ontology. This is important because such an approach to explanation is not new. Most notably, van Fraassen and Garfinkel have developed it in particular ways and for particular purposes within the philosophy of science and social theory. Setting out the different ways in which the contrastive approach has been developed is useful for identifying what is different about Lawson's approach, its potential and limits. Lawson's proposal is more modest and focusses on causal investigation in a manner that flows from his approach to social ontology. Contrast explanation provides a substitute for controlled experiments and facilitates identifying social mechanisms. It also enables exploration of the manifold presuppositions of our explanatory questions. We argue that this is a useful and important contribution to overcoming some of the many problems economics faces.","[Morgan, Jamie] Leeds Beckett Univ, Sch Business, Sch Econ Analyt & Int Business, Room 520,Portland Pl, Leeds LS1 3HB, W Yorkshire, England; [Patomaki, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland",Leeds Beckett University; University of Helsinki,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Sch Business, Sch Econ Analyt & Int Business, Room 520,Portland Pl, Leeds LS1 3HB, W Yorkshire, England.",j.a.morgan@leedsbeckett.ac.uk,,,,,,,74,21,21,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

While the freedom of movement was quickly embraced, civil society revival lagged due to the eroded civic norms, declining social capital, and worsening economic conditions. In this paper, we examine the link between the out-migration of relatives and friends and the pro-social behavior of the left behinds in two post-socialist countries Bulgaria and Romania the EU's poorest, and among the least happy and most corrupt member states. We show that having close contacts abroad is consistently positively associated with civic engagement and that the cultural transmission of norms from abroad could be driving the results. Specifically, the strength of the civic engagement culture of the family or friend's destination matters for the pro-social behavior of respondents in the home countries. Our results imply that the emigration of family and friends may have positive but previously undocumented consequences for the individuals and communities left behind in Bulgaria and Romania. Given civil society's role for development in post-socialist Europe and the socio-economic and institutional challenges that Bulgaria and Romania face compared with the rest of the EU, understanding the channels fostering civil society and well-being are important for national and EU pol, icymakers.

The results of difference-in-differences and synthetic control estimations show that the minimum wage decreased both a firm's likelihood to train new apprentices and number of new apprentices.

Customers increase consumption by 3.5-5% in response to more frequent information. This result is reconciled in models of price and quantity uncertainty, where increases in billing frequency reduce the distortion in consumer perceptions.

Most of these effects are assumed to be biological - including poor nutrition during critical windows of fetal development, or through increased maternal stress. However, in addition to these biological effects, climatic conditions at the time of conception may also cause changes in parental behavior, not only affecting the mix of parents who conceive, but also the characteristics of the children once born. This paper explores whether increases in ambient temperature at the time of conception, while in utero, or after birth affect educational and health outcomes as adults. Using Census and Demographic and Health Survey data from sub-Saharan Africa, we show that individuals conceived during high temperatures have higher educational attainment and literacy. In addition, we find evidence of temperature effects at other times in utero, especially during the first trimester. We then explore the biological and behavioral mechanisms through which this effect may occur, including heat-induced changes in sexual behavior, differences in parental characteristics, and intensified fetal selection. We conclude that fetal selection is the most likely mechanism driving our result. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report on a laboratory experiment exploring whether the choice of some to contribute money in lieu effort affects the voluntary contributions of those who continue to provide effort. Subjects complete lab tasks as a contribution to a public good - carbon emission reductions. These effort contributions decrease as peers accept an offer to contribute money instead of effort. However, the aggregate result masks significant heterogeneity. Those who choose not to buy out despite its expected profitability have no response to the treatment, while those for whom it would not be profitable to buy out register large reductions in effort contributions. The magnitude of these responses increases in the share of the group accepting the buyout, suggesting that is the act of peers buying out - rather than the introduction of monetary incentives - that drives the effect.

This paper examines the long term effects and subsequent intergenerational transmission of exposure in childhood to the natural disasters that have occurred in Latin America in the last 100 years. The identification strategy exploits the exogenous variation in geographic location, timing and exposure of different birth cohorts to natural disasters. This study measures individuals' exposure to each disaster based on their geographic location at birth to avoid any bias in the estimates due to possible selective migration caused by each disaster. The main results indicate that children in utero and young children are the most vulnerable to natural disasters and suffer the most long-lasting negative effects. These effects include less human capital accumulation, worse health and fewer assets when they are adults. Effects are found to have a non-linear relationship with the level of development of each country. Furthermore, the results provide evidence of the intergenerational transmission of shocks, indicating that children born to mothers who had been exposed to natural disasters also have less education and increased child labor.","[Caruso, German Daniel] World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, World Bank Grp, 1850 1 St NW,Room 14-386, Washington, DC 20006 USA",The World Bank,"Caruso, GD (通讯作者)，World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, World Bank Grp, 1850 1 St NW,Room 14-386, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",gcaruso@worldbank.org,,,,,,,64,55,69,4,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

As a middle-income country experiencing strong socio-economic changes, China provides a relevant case study. This article forms part of the literature on the impact of SES on body size and aims to clarify and update information about the relationship between income (one specific dimension of SES) and adult body size in urban China. To analyze this potentially complex relationship, we rely on semiparametric methods that enable us to leave the nature of the association between income and body size unspecified in the regression analysis. Empirical investigations conducted as part of this research are based on longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey covering the period 1991-2011. Our results show that the income-body size relationship remains complex, gender-specific and very non-linear in urban China. We also provide evidence of the reversal of the income-body-size gradient, a reversal that is observed only for women for the period under study. Finally, we emphasize the specific features of the gradient for the two tails of the income distribution which could indicate that local deviations from the near-universal reversal path are possible.","[Clement, Matthieu] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Clément, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",matthieu.clement@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,39,10,10,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We study the role of private and public LTC insurance in this environment and compare the properties and optimality of the topping up versus opting out public insurance schemes. Under topping up, the required LTC is less than full insurance and should be provided publicly unless private insurance market for dependency is fair. With an opting out scheme, there will be three possible equilibria depending on the children's degree of altruism. These imply: full LTC insurance with no aid from children, less than full insurance just enough to induce aid, and full insurance with aid. Fair private insurance can support only the first equilibrium. Opting out policies are self-targeted and dominate topping up schemes when the degree of children's altruism is sufficiently large. However, when the degree of altruism is small the dominance goes in the opposite direction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the potential effectiveness of the reforms is compromised by the attempt of policy-makers to achieve three goals which form an impossible trinity: increase firm autonomy; improve oversight; and assign new developmental missions to state firms. The goal of assigning new developmental missions to state firms is reflected in the design of new state investment companies which are intended to gradually take over ownership functions from existing agencies. The structure and function of the new ownership agencies undermines the potential of the corporate governance reforms at the enterprise level. These contradictions will be costly because state firms will likely be ineffective in carrying out developmental missionsparticularly technology innovationwhile also failing in the enterprise reform goal of becoming more efficient and profitable.","[Naughton, Barry] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Naughton, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",bnaughton@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,18,24,27,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

I study the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency in the class of strategy-proof mechanisms. The main finding is that for strategy-proof mechanisms the following efficiency and fairness criteria are mutually incompatible: (1) ex-post efficiency and envy freeness, (2) ordinal efficiency and weak envy-freeness, and (3) ordinal efficiency and equal division lower bound. Result 1 is the first impossibility result for this setting that uses ex-post efficiency; results 2 and 3 are more practical than similar results in the literature. In addition, for N = 3, I give two characterizations of the celebrated random serial dictatorship mechanism: it is the unique strategy-proof, ex-post efficient mechanism that (4) provides agents that have the same ordinal preferences with assignments not dominated by each other (weak envy-freeness among equals), or (5) provides agents that have the same cardinal preferences with assignments of equal expected utility (symmetry). These results strengthen the characterization by Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001); result 5 implies the impossibility result by Zhou (1990). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Motivated by the lack of appropriate frameworks to explore interlinkages between emerging and advanced economies, we propose a two-country model with explicit trade and financial channels. This enables us to identify the differences in the implications of domestic versus global financial crises and explore the role of real and financial cross-border spillovers. We find that (i) the interaction between the degree of trade integration and the scale of financial contagion; and (ii) the relative importance of the export versus balance sheet channels play a key role in determining the overall impact of the global financial shock.

We find that the asset growth anomaly is more pronounced across loss firms and is significantly dampened by the inclusion of profit firms in the sample. The raw and abnormal returns earned from a hedge strategy on balance sheet growth for loss firms are almost two times higher than the respective returns for profit firms. Our evidence casts doubt on a risk based explanation, thereby lending credence to the suggestion that the asset-growth effect is attributable to mispricing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For a large class of reduced-form utility functions that reflect these properties, the optimal test is binary and not subject to false positives. I uncover the forces that drive this result and show how the problem with endogenous participation can be transformed into a problem to that the concavification approach from the Bayesian persuasion literature applies. Furthermore, for a non-reduced version of my model where the designer estimates the agent's quality but suffers either more from false positives or from false negatives, I show that the same type of test is optimal.

This paper sheds light on the relationship between resource abundance and the selectivity of migration. First, I combine a Dutch-Disease model with a Roy-Borjas-model in order to elaborate on the relationship between resource shocks and migrant selectivity theoretically. Thereby, I predict that resource booms give rise to brain drain effects which are mediated through distributional effects under certain conditions. Second, I provide empirical evidence for the effect of resource shocks on migrant selectivity based on a structural equation model in order to disentangle effects on income inequality and migrant selectivity. The results show that resource shocks, especially oil booms, strengthen brain drain effects in a sample with 116 source and 23 destination countries between 1910 and 2009.","[Steinberg, Daniel] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Melanchthonstr 30, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Steinberg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Melanchthonstr 30, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",Daniel.Steinberg@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,59,22,24,2,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In environments where collusion agreements are likely to be both proposed and executed by the involved parties, this approach may neglect information leakages from simply a proposal to collude. We consider a model of collusion where one informed bidder proposes to another, as in Eso and Schummer (2004). We allow for general interdependent values and affiliated signals. In contrast to third party modeling approaches, collusion is inefficient from both a social perspective (except for the case of pure common values) and from the perspective of the ring. Both bidders are better off than without colluding, but the surplus extracted from the seller is distributed asymmetrically between the bidders. The potential for information leakage from proposing is bad for low types, who reveal that they are weak competitors, but is advantageous for high types, because they are able to signal their strength. We identify a so-called briber's curse: whereby acceptance of a proposal causes the proposer to downgrade her expected value for the object. When there is additional competition in the form of bidders outside of the cartel, the briber's curse significantly harms cartel profits and raises seller revenues. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Utilizing this index we test the predictions of a simple theoretical model in a Markov Switching framework which allows to identify the impact of ethnic/racial tension in different states of the economy.

Foundation-owned companies appear to perform surprisingly well in terms of profitability and growth, despite lacking governance mechanisms such as profit incentives or takeover threats. Given their non-profit ownership, they might be expected to behave more responsibly towards stakeholders, such as employees or customers (Hansmann, 1980), but so far there has been little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. This paper presents new research on the reputation and responsibility of foundation-owned companies. In a panel of large Danish companies 2001-11 we find that foundation-owned firms have better reputations and are regarded as more socially responsible in corporate image ratings. Secondary evidence on labour market behaviour is consistent with these findings. Using matched employer-employee data we show that foundation-owned companies are more stable employers, pay their employees better, and keep them for longer. Altogether, the evidence indicates that foundation-ownership is associated with more responsible business behaviour towards employees.","[Borsting, Christa; Thomsen, Steen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Governance, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Borsting, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Corp Governance, Copenhagen, Denmark.",cdb.int@cbs.dk; st.int@cbs.dk,,,,,,,39,15,15,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

However, the many different labels consumers encounter can be confusing, which makes assessing environmental quality associated with each label difficult. How does consumer misperception of competing eco-labels affect market structure and welfare? This article provides theoretical insight into this issue by using a double-differentiation model in which three products compete: an unlabeled product and two distinctly eco-labeled products, one with a medium and one with a high level of environmental quality. The study investigates the effects of consumers' imperfect information when they perceive all eco-labels as a sign of the same high environmental quality and consider each label as a unique product. This misperception can weaken the firm that provides the greenest product, though paradoxically this situation is not always detrimental to social welfare. However, depending on the certifying organizations, consumer misperception can induce firms to use a greenwashing strategy and encourage nongovernmental organizations and regulators to introduce less stringent standards.","[Brecard, Dorothee] Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Campus Porte Italie,70 Ave Roger Devoucoux, F-83000 Toulon, France",Universite de Toulon,"Brécard, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Campus Porte Italie,70 Ave Roger Devoucoux, F-83000 Toulon, France.",brecard@univ-tln.fr,"Brécard, Dorothée/HJO-8652-2023","Brecard, Dorothee/0000-0002-0715-0234",,,,,37,29,32,6,102,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

But do such framing differences affect behavior? We report the results of a laboratory experiment on threshold public goods with heterogeneous endowments and different frames. Four treatments frame two variables, each in one of two ways: the contribution metric is expressed either in absolute terms or relative to endowments, and the contribution choice is framed as either keeping or contributing some of one's endowment. Subjects can exchange proposals and counterproposals. Our results reveal a broad consensus that high endowed subjects contribute more in absolute terms than the low endowed, which we trace to subjects' reported distributive preferences. Both high and low endowed subjects contribute about two-thirds of their endowments in all treatments - save when the metric is framed as contributing in absolute terms: then the low endowed contribute significantly more, around 80%. This last result suggests the possibility that the most frequently used frame in public good experiments induces higher contributions among the less affluent than economically equivalent alternate frames.

However, little is known about how urban agglomeration in China has evolved since the country began to experience much faster urbanization and deep marketization after 2000. Based on panel data of 281 cities between 2000 and 2013, our spatial panel data regression results show that the scale impact of city size on urban productivity appears to have an inverted U shape, and its effect will grow when the cities' industrial structure becomes more dominated by the service sector. There are also significant spatial interactions and spatial heterogeneity of urban agglomeration among Chinese cities. Furthermore, we compute the optimal size for each city and find that most Chinese cities are still undersized in recent years. Based on our findings, we argue that the Chinese government should focus on promoting sufficient growth of medium sized cities in its new urbanization strategy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A regulator is introduced in the third stage of the price-location game through a welfare function to model zoning preferences from firms and consumers. An equilibrium outcome is then found for both spatial configurations. When the regulator is inclined to favor consumers (consumer-oriented) both firms are restricted to locate at one point to serve the whole market. Nevertheless, when the preferences of the regulator are biased towards firms (firm-oriented) the zoning area is maximized, with both firms being located at the market boundaries.

Utilizing a 16-year panel data set for Japanese manufacturing firms, we employ panel probit estimation to examine the likelihood of exit from export markets. The results of our estimations show, first, that the exit probability from export markets decreased over the export duration. Second, the probability of exiting from export markets tended to be lower when firms were more R&D intensive both prior to and after starting exporting. The first result implies that exporting experience plays an important role in firms' survival in export markets. Our second result implies that firms producing differentiated products likely have a greater incentive to make upfront investments to start exporting, and these investments, in turn, enable such firms to survive in export markets for a longer period.","[Inui, Tomohiko] Gakushuin Univ, Toshima, Japan; [Inui, Tomohiko] Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan; [Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Miyakawa, Daisuke] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",Gakushuin University; Hitotsubashi University,"Inui, T (通讯作者)，Gakushuin Univ, Toshima, Japan.;Inui, T (通讯作者)，Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517","JSPS KAKENHI [23243050]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243050, 16H03623] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was conducted as a part of the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) research project The Competitiveness of Japanese Firms: The Causes and Effects of Productivity Dynamics.

The mother logit model allows utilities of a given alternative to depend on attributes of other alternatives. It was designed to relax the independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property while keeping the random terms independently and identically distributed extreme value distributed (McFadden et al., 1978). We adapt and extend the RRM model proposed by Chorus (2014) to the case of recursive logit (RL) route choice models (Fosgerau et al., 2013). We argue that these RRM models can be cast as mother logit models and we define such models that are equivalent to the RRM ones considered in this paper. The results show that one of the RRM models and its mother logit equivalent has the best out-of-sample fit indicating that utility functions based on attribute differences best explains the choices in our application.","[Mai, Tien] Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mai, Tien; Bastin, Fabian; Frejinger, Emma] CIRRELT, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bastin, Fabian; Frejinger, Emma] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Mai, T (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Mai, T (通讯作者)，CIRRELT, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",AnhTien.Mai@cirrelt.ca,,,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [435678-2013],National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This research was funded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, discovery grant 435678-2013.

The effects on real output are positive, although they take longer to materialize (around 4 quarters after the shock). We then re-examine the effects of low oil prices on the US economy over different sub-periods using monthly observations on real oil prices, real equity prices and real dividends. We confirm the perverse positive relationship between oil and equity prices over the period since the 2008 financial crisis highlighted in the recent literature, but show that this relationship has been unstable when considered over the longer time period of 1946-2016. In contrast, we find a stable negative relationship between oil prices and real dividends which we argue is a better proxy for economic activity (as compared to equity prices). On the supply side, the effects of lower oil prices differ widely across the different oil producers, and could be perverse initially, as some of the major oil producers try to compensate their loss of revenues by raising production. Taking demand and supply adjustments to oil price changes as a whole, we conclude that oil markets equilibrate but rather slowly, with large episodic swings between low and high oil prices.

Extending the traditional Balassa-Samueslon effect, it shows that the real interest rate fall in the Euro area (EA) periphery following the single currency's inception induced an increase in the relative price of non-tradable goods. Using a new data set, it documents the dynamics of the tradable and the non-tradable sectors over 1995-2013 and the expansion of the non-tradable sector in the periphery before the crisis. It then carries out an econometric estimation for 11 EA countries over 1995-2013 and quantifies the contribution of the pure Balassa-Samuelson effect and the impact of the interest rate on non-tradable relative prices. Diverging evolution in the interest rate impacted greatly the evolution of non-tradable relative prices within the EA over the period. In Greece, the fall in the real interest rate over 1995-2008 could explain almost half of the non-tradable price increase relative to the EA average, while in Germany the increase in the real interest rate might have contributed up to 7% of the decrease of the non-tradable price relative to the average of the EA.

Recent signs of disunity among ASEAN member countries and the slow progress made towards establishing the ASEAN Community have not helped ASEAN's case either. On the other hand, even critics of ASEAN grudgingly admit that no regional arrangement in East Asia would likely succeed without ASEAN's involvement in a leading capacity. Against that backdrop, there are at least five interrelated ways ASEAN centrality has been understood and appropriated by its devotees and detractors alike. Centrality has been defined in terms of ASEAN as leader or driver, as convener or facilitator, as hub or key node, as an agent of (proposed) progress (and not just process), and as little more than an expedient device to preserve ASEAN's primacy in Asian regionalism and to ward off any form of architectural renovation which could lead to its marginalization.","[Tan, See Seng] Nanyang Technol Univ, S Rajaratnam Sch Int Studies, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Tan, SS (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, S Rajaratnam Sch Int Studies, Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",issstan@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,94,20,20,1,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Launched 25 years ago,(1) DEF is the first mutual fund in North America to include extra-financial criteria in its evaluation of business environmental management practices (fund securities) for the information of individual investors. The findings of this empirical research show how a major cooperative bank can generate social innovation and how this entails organizational innovations. The findings also reveal how these innovations benefit from the strategic and process resources that the Desjardins Movement managed to develop while taking into account both its core business (as a bank) and its purpose (as a cooperative).

Although the EU is projected to reach this goal, its achievement of objectives under its Emissions Trading System (ETS) may be delayed by carbon leakage, which is defined as a situation in which the reduction in emissions in the ETS region is partially offset by an increase in carbon emissions in the non-ETS regions. We study the interaction between emissions and hydropower availability in order to estimate the magnitude of carbon leakage in the South-East Europe Regional Electricity Market (SEE-REM) via a bottom-up partial equilibrium framework. We find that 6.3% to 40.5% of the emissions reduction achieved in the ETS part of SEE-REM could be leaked to the non-ETS part depending on the price of allowances. Somewhat surprisingly, greater hydropower availability may increase emissions in the ETS part of SEE-REM. However, carbon leakage might be limited by demand response to higher electricity prices in the non-ETS area of SEE-REM. Such carbon leakage can affect both the competitiveness of producers in ETS member countries on the periphery of the ETS and the achievement of EU targets for CO2 emissions reduction. Meanwhile, higher non-ETS electricity prices imply that the current policy can have undesirable outcomes for consumers in non-ETS countries, while non-ETS producers would experience an increase in their profits due to higher power prices as well as exports. The presence of carbon leakage in SEE-REM suggests that current EU policy might become more effective when it is expanded to cover more countries in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By estimating the spatial Durbin model for panel data on 31 Chinese provinces from 2007-2013, we investigate the robust relationship between effective tax rates and economic growth in China from a spatial econometric perspective. We find that labor income tax rates are significantly negatively related to growth within a province, and insignificantly related to growth in neighboring provinces because the vote with one's feet mechanism is inapplicable in China. A decrease in capital income tax rates significantly enhances growth. Capital income tax competition characterized as race to the bottom induces neighboring provinces to also cut capital income tax rates to promote local economic growth.

We provide an explicit learning foundation for RVE and contrast it to standard solution concepts in the literature.","[Esponda, Ignacio] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, Campus Box 1133,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Pouzo, Demian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Esponda, I (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, Campus Box 1133,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",iesponda@wustl.edu; dpouzo@econ.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,49,12,14,0,4,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

We examine two different approaches: (1) the public interest theory, where PSB size is selected to maximise citizens' welfare and (2) the public choice theory, where PSB size is determined by self-interested politicians. Based on the foundations of these two views, we derive theoretical predictions about how PSB size changes with an increase in political competition. Then, we test these predictions using panel data from OECD countries over the period 1993-2010, and we find that the degree of electoral competition is negatively associated with PSB size. We conclude that PSB size does not reflect the public interest theory, but rather upholds the public choice theory, especially the politicians' rent-seeking motive.","[Ihara, Saori] Meisei Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1-1 Hodokubo, Hino, Tokyo 1918506, Japan; [Yazaki, Yukihiro] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan",Meisei University; Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Yazaki, Y (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan.",saori.ihara@meisei-u.ac.jp; y-yazaki@tmu.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K17138]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17138] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We really appreciate an editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

The overall impact of the policy appears to be relatively small. However, theory and distributional analysis isolates a subset of taxpayers expected to be especially sensitive to reporting, who report receipts equal to or slightly exceeding the receipts reported on 1099-K. Among this set of taxpayers, information reporting induced more complete tax reporting-30% of sensitive taxpayers filed a return declaring business income for the first time, and among those that were already filing, we estimate an increase in reported receipts by up to 24%. These taxpayers largely offset increased reported receipts with increased reported expenses, which do not face information reporting, diminishing the impact on reported net taxable income.

In particular, we derive comparative statics showing that degree is typically positively related to social group size but negatively related to the size of the overlap across multiple social groups.

Previous experiments used applicants' names as indicators for different ethnicities, but this signal may not always be perceived as intended by the experimenters. In this study, a novel approach was applied that signals ethnic background using carefully matched photos as distinct visual cues. While the results document employment discrimination against all groups with a migration background, it is most pronounced for applicants with African heritage. To determine why and when discrimination occurs, an array of firm- and job-specific characteristics were examined.

The estimation results show that positive country image has an elevating effect and negative country image has a depressing effect on export prices. The results also indicate that the lower the level of economic development of an export or import country, the stronger the export price effect of country image. As distances between export countries and trading partners increase, the elevating effect of positive country image on export prices becomes weaker. However, the depressing effect of negative country image does not become weaker over greater distances. We find that export prices are depressed by negative country image to a greater degree for China than for other countries.

Following Luce and Raiffa (Games and decisions: introduction and critical survey. Wiley, New York, 1957), we adopt a natural representation of such a situation which takes as primitives a set of conceivable actions A, a set of states S and a consequence function rho: A x S -> C. Each action induces a map from states to consequences, a Savage act, and each mixed action induces a map from states to probability distributions over consequences, an Anscombe-Aumann act. Under an axiom of consequentialism, preferences over pure or mixed actions yield corresponding preferences over the induced acts. This observation allows us to relate the Luce-Raiffa description of a decision problem to the most common framework of modern decision theory which directly takes as primitive a preference relation over the set of all Anscombe-Aumann acts. The key advantage of the latter framework is the possibility of applying powerful convex analysis techniques as in the seminal work of Schmeidler (Econometrica 57: 571-587, 1989) and the vast literature that followed. This paper shows that we can maintain the mathematical convenience of the Anscombe-Aumann framework within a description of decision problems which is closer to many applications and experiments. We argue that our framework ismore expressive as it allows us to be both explicit and parsimonious about the assumed richness of the set of conceivable actions, and to directly capture preference for randomization as an expression of uncertainty aversion.","[Battigalli, Pierpaolo; Cerreia-Vioglio, Simone; Maccheroni, Fabio; Marinacci, Massimo] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy; [Battigalli, Pierpaolo; Cerreia-Vioglio, Simone; Maccheroni, Fabio; Marinacci, Massimo] IGIER, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Maccheroni, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Milan, Italy.;Maccheroni, F (通讯作者)，IGIER, Milan, Italy.",fabio.maccheroni@unibocconi.it,,"MARINACCI, MASSIMO/0000-0002-0079-4176; MACCHERONI, FABIO/0000-0001-6338-6383; CERREIA VIOGLIO, SIMONE/0000-0001-7383-9139","European Research Council (advanced grant BRSCDP-TEA); Italian Ministry of Education, Universities, and Research [20103S5RN3_005]; AXA Research Fund","European Research Council (advanced grant BRSCDP-TEA); Italian Ministry of Education, Universities, and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund)","We thank Veronica Cappelli, Karin Hendrix Blissitt, Giacomo Lanzani, Sujoy Mukerji, Kelly Gail Strada, and two anonymous referees, and the participants of the NES 20th anniversary conference (Moscow, December 2012) and D-TEA and RUD workshops (Paris, May 2013) for useful comments and suggestions.

The focus of our paper is on consequences of a policy mix of tariffs and foreign direct investment (FDI) tax in a developing economy. We assume all firms are technologically heterogeneous and that foreign firms are technologically superior to local firms. Central to our model is the assumption that FDI activities by multinational corporations would lead to diffusion of technology in the developing economy. We show the existence of a non-trivial equilibrium where most technologically advanced foreign firms emerge as multinationals, engage in FDI activities and this in turn leads to the diffusion of technology. We also show that trade liberalization without liberalization of foreign investment may lead to the protection of most technological backward local firms in the developing economy and such liberalization can reduce the welfare of a representative consumer.","[Oladi, Reza] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Oladi, R (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",reza.oladi@usu.edu,"Oladi, Reza/AAA-7218-2019","Oladi, Reza/0000-0002-4621-7622",Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,"We would like to thank Eric Bond, Ron Jones and the participants of WEAI conference for their comments and suggestions.

Economists have been trying to shed light on this question by studying whether suicide rates are related to contemporaneous socioeconomic conditions. This paper goes one step further: we test whether suicides are linked to forward-looking behavior. In Italy, collective sentence reductions (pardons) often lead to massive releases of prisoners. More importantly, they are usually preceded by prolonged parliamentary activity (legislative proposals, discussion, voting, etc.) that inmates seem to follow closely. We use the legislative proposals for collective pardons to measure changes in the inmates' expectations about the length of their sentences, and find that suicide rates tend to be significantly lower when pardons are proposed in congress. This suggests that, among inmates in Italian prisons, the average decision to commit suicide responds to changes in current expectations about future conditions. At least partially, therefore, the decision seems rationalizable.","[Campaniello, Nadia; Mastrobuoni, Giovanni] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Diasakos, Theodoros M.] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland; [Mastrobuoni, Giovanni] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, TO, Italy",University of Essex; University of Stirling; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Campaniello, N (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",ncampa@essex.ac.uk; theodoros.diasakos@stir.ac.uk; gmastrob@essex.ac.uk,"Mastrobuoni, Giovanni/AAE-3941-2019; Campaniello, Nadia/AAE-3971-2019; Diasakos, Theodoros/AAU-4460-2021","Mastrobuoni, Giovanni/0000-0002-7597-6855; Diasakos, Theodoros/0000-0001-7364-1472; Campaniello, Nadia/0000-0001-9497-7194",,,,,56,5,5,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have frequently been used to examine the impact of climate change on agriculture. However, these studies do not focus on country-specific issues related to the link between climate change and agriculture. This paper aims to address this gap by investigating the economy-wide impacts of climate change on Nepalese agriculture. Nepal makes an interesting case study as it has one of the most vulnerable agricultural economies in South Asia. This paper develops a comparative static multi-household CGE model to trace the direct and indirect impacts of climate change in Nepal. The results suggest that climate change has a significant negative impact on the overall Nepalese economy due to the induced loss of agricultural productivity. The results further reveal that rural households in Nepal, whose livelihoods primarily depend on subsistence farming, will face additional climate change induced stresses due to already overstrained poverty and a weak social welfare system. The results indicate an urgent need to mainstream adaptation strategies to lessen the negative impacts of any climate change induced loss of agricultural productivity in Nepal.","[Chalise, Sudarshan; Naranpanawa, Athula; Bandara, Jayatilleke S.; Sarker, Tapan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Chalise, S (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",sudarshan.chalise@griffithuni.edu.au,"Sarker, Tapan/ABG-2973-2021; Naranpanawa, Athula/AAD-2533-2021","Naranpanawa, Athula/0000-0003-4422-0868; Sarker, Tapan/0000-0002-0682-2940",,,,,46,34,36,4,60,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Some Arab autocracies have experimented with partial liberalization, yielding benefits mainly for connected parties or cronies. There has been a chronic inability to craft policies capable of commanding widespread support in the population. Instead, the main groups in the economy have coalesced around the preservation of rents at the cost of achieving wider benefits. The paper attributes this not only to a combination of lack of credibility as well as issues of time consistency, but also to the failure to develop and present a coherent case for reforms capable of conferring benefits on the wider population, rather than concentrated benefits for a few.","[Commander, Simon] Altura Partners, London, England; [Commander, Simon] IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain",IE University,"Commander, S (通讯作者)，Altura Partners, London, England.;Commander, S (通讯作者)，IE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain.",scommander@alturapartners.org,,,,,,,33,4,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We argue that the distribution of public school spending across school districts under public school finance systems affects intergenerational mobility within the United States. We build a dynamic model in which school districts vote over public school spending per pupil taking the finance system as given. We embed this model with median voting at the district level within a fairly standard model of human capital accumulation. Our model can replicate the relationship between the distribution of public school spending and intergenerational mobility observed in data. Furthermore, three counterfactual simulations suggest that i) the correlation between parental human capital and a child's learning ability plays a significant role in explaining the cross-state variation in intergenerational mobility, ii) a more equal distribution of public school spending under a foundation program by relaxing a borrowing constraint improves intergenerational mobility, especially when a child's learning ability is not highly dependent on parental human capital, and iii) switching to a full state funding program improves intergenerational mobility, but not enormously. This is because full state funding limits public school spending, which hinders intergenerational mobility. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, to achieve this, regulators have applied different market designs across countries and regions. In this paper we employ laboratory methods to explore the relationship between market design, capacity provision and pricing in electricity markets. Subjects act as firms, choosing their generation capacity and competing in uniform price auction markets. We compare three regulatory designs: (1) a baseline price cap system that restricts scarcity rents, (2) a price spike regime that effectively lifts these restrictions, and (3) a capacity market that directly rewards the provision of capacity. Restricting price spikes leads to underinvestment. In line with the regulatory intention both alternative designs lead to sufficient investment albeit at the cost of higher energy prices during peak periods and substantial capacity payments in the capacity market regime. To some extent these results confirm theoretical expectations. However, we also find lower than predicted spot market prices as sellers compete relatively intensely in capacities and prices, and the capacity markets are less competitive than predicted.","[Le Coq, Chloe] Stockholm Sch Econ, SITE, Stockholm, Sweden; [Orzen, Henrik] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, Mannheim, Germany; [Schwenen, Sebastian] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Schwenen, Sebastian] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany",Stockholm School of Economics; University of Mannheim; Technical University of Munich; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Le Coq, C (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, SITE, Stockholm, Sweden.",chloe.lecoq@hhs.se; henrik.orzen@uni-mannheim.de; sebastian.schwenen@tum.de,"Le Coq, Chloe/HGB-7597-2022","Le Coq, Chloe/0000-0002-0759-8733",Swedish Competition Authority; Torsten Soderberg Foundation [E37/13],Swedish Competition Authority; Torsten Soderberg Foundation,"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Swedish Competition Authority and are thankful to the Torsten Soderberg Foundation grant that supported Le Coq's work under grant E37/13.

This design heavily depends on the way R&D spillovers operate. There are two distinct types of R&D spillover: output spillover and input spillover. An input spillover operates on the expenditure toward pollution reduction, whereas an output spillover manifests as the achieved abatement. Under optimal emissions taxation, significant differences arise due to this distinction, in particular, when the spillover operates on R&D inputs. In an oligopolistic setting, the result is higher R&D expenditure, but also higher aggregate emissions and, consequently, higher emissions taxes. By contrast, when spillovers occur in R&D output, there is a U-shaped relationship between the optimal tax and the spillover, showing a trade-off between the optimal tax rate and spillovers when these are low. In terms of the relative effectiveness of different R&D organization setups, combining emissions taxes with R&D cooperation, this paper shows that under low levels of R&D spillover R&D cooperation gives higher emissions reductions, whereas when spillovers are high this is not the case.","[McDonald, Stuart] Renmin Univ China, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna] La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia",Renmin University of China; La Trobe University,"McDonald, S (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",smcdonald@renmin.edu.cn; j.poyago-theotoky@latrobe.edu.au,"Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna/D-3301-2015","Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna/0000-0003-2957-6612",Global Change Institute Small Grant; University of Queensland Early Career Researcher Grant,Global Change Institute Small Grant; University of Queensland Early Career Researcher Grant,"We are grateful to Emmanuel Petrakis, an anonymous referee, an Associate Editor and the Editor for valuable comments.

Asymmetry between the penalty for an incorrect forecast and the reward for a correct forecast is a necessary condition for the existence of this revealing equilibrium. If the penalty is larger than the reward, the unique revealing equilibrium is a separating equilibrium, where only the low quality signal is disclosed in order to induce the rival's imitation. On the other hand, if the reward is much larger than the penalty, the unique revealing equilibrium is a pooling equilibrium, where the signal is always revealed in order to induce the rival's deviation.

A trustful player who is cheated too often, should start trusting less, until her beliefs are correct. For this reason we model trust as an equilibrium phenomenon. Receivers of an offer to transact choose whether or not to cheat. Cheating entails a cost, with an idiosyncratic component and a socially determined one, decreasing with the mass of players who cheat. The model either has a unique equilibrium level of trust (the proportion of transactions not cheated on), or two one with high and one with low trust. Differences in trust can result from different fundamentals or from different equilibria being realized. Surprisingly, under certain conditions these two alternatives are partially identifiable from an empirical point of view. Our model can be reinterpreted with the cost of cheating arising from an enforcement mechanism that punishes cheaters in a targeted way using limited resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

I show that the revenue loss of county governments was largely offset by tougher tax enforcement. The incentive for VAT enforcement can be weakened, however, if the county: (1) receives a lower share of total VAT revenues; (2) has a broader VAT tax base; or, (3) has more abundant sources of revenue from land sales. These findings suggest that incentives of local governments can be vital to tax enforcement and to the tax capacity of a country. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In modeling the aging process we draw on recent advances within the fields of biology and medicine. In the model individuals decide on optimal consumption during life, the age of retirement, and (via health investments) the timing of their death. Accordingly, years in retirement is fully endogenously determined. Using the model we can account for the evolution of age of retirement and longevity across cohorts born between 1850 and 1940 in the US. Our analysis indicates that 2/3 of the observed increase in longevity can be accounted for by wage growth, whereas the driver behind the observed rising age of retirement appears to have been technological change in health care. Both technology and income contribute to the rise in years in retirement, but the contribution from income is slightly greater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

But how can a technical change which makes the economy less productive make capitalists better off if workers are no worse off?

Most country-level empirical studies find weak support for this prediction. This paper makes two contributions to this debate. First, I identify some of the key shortcomings of previous tests and provide a new empirical analysis that corrects for these limitations. Using a dataset covering 89 developed and developing democracies, I find that inequality is associated with more redistribution. Second, I show that inequality's effect on redistribution is weaker in democracies in which the poor -defined as the people with income below the median are divided along ethnic lines than in those in which they are ethnically unified. Taken together, these results suggest that although economic inequality increases redistribution, the magnitude of the relationship is conditional on how inequality interacts with other social cleavages, such as ethnicity.","[Houle, Christian] Michigan State Univ, Polit Sci, 220 Trowbridge Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Houle, C (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Polit Sci, 220 Trowbridge Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",houlech1@msu.edu,,,,,,,79,28,33,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This framework includes both exogenous and endogenous state variables. In addition, the equilibrium system from the private sector contains both backward-looking and forward-looking dynamics. We provide recursive characterizations and algorithms to solve for robust policy. We apply our method to a basic New Keynesian model of optimal monetary policy with persistent cost-push shocks.

Uncertainty, in turn, is expected to increase the effort made by competing agents (Cowen and Glazer, 1996; Dubey and Haimanko, 2003; Dubey and Wu, 2001). Theoretical predictions are derived and experimental evidence is collected for two competing agents, with the bonus awarded to that agent who outperforms the other. Sampling occasions (1 or 3), cost of production (high or low), cost symmetry (asymmetric or symmetric), and piece-rate reward are manipulated factorially to test the robustness of the effects of uncertainty. For control, a single-agent case is included. Results indicate that, for tournaments, greater uncertainty does indeed lead to greater than expected effort and lower average variable costs.","[Avrahami, Judith; Kareev, Yaakov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Gueth, Werner] LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy; [Gueth, Werner] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany; [Gueth, Werner] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Uske, Tobias] Max Planck Inst Econ, Jena, Germany",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Luiss Guido Carli University; Max Planck Society; Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Max Planck Society,"Gueth, W (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy.;Gueth, W (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.;Gueth, W (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",gueth@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

To study these phenomena, in this article I present a theory of petitions and public protests that explores their limits as mechanisms to aggregate information. The key assumption is that valuable information is dispersed among citizens. Through petitions and protests, citizens can signal their private information to the policy maker, who can then choose to use it or not. I first show that if citizens' individual signals are not sufficiently precise, information aggregation is impossible, no matter how large is the population of informed citizens, even if the conflict with the policy maker is small. I then characterize the conditions on conflict and the signal structure that guarantee information aggregation. When these conditions are satisfied, I show that full information aggregation is possible as the population grows to infinity. When they are not satisfied, I show that information aggregation may still be possible if social media are available.","[Battaglini, Marco] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Battaglini, Marco] EIEF, Rome, Italy",Cornell University,"Battaglini, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Battaglini, M (通讯作者)，EIEF, Rome, Italy.",,,"Battaglini, Marco/0000-0001-9690-0721",,,,,107,29,37,4,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We use an alternating offers bargaining game in which the South can resort to compulsory licensing (CL) if the two parties fail to reach agreement by a certain deadline. The presence of international price spillovers introduces two novel features into the standard bargaining problem: the surplus from entry prior to the CL deadline may be negative, and CL can yield higher surplus than entry. We establish conditions under which equilibrium may exhibit immediate entry, preemptive entry just prior to the CL deadline, or the occurrence of CL.

Within this dataset, we show that financial institutions seem to be collecting and using more consumer information when extending credit. We then develop a life-cycle model of lending using a novel contract structure reflecting modern credit cards, where interest rates and credit limits are jointly determined before actual borrowing takes place. Within the model, giving lenders more information on consumers generates realistic results along several dimensions. More information leads to better pricing, moving the market from a 'pooling' to a 'separating' equilibrium, generating the observed increase in variances, with the gains primarily going to young agents.","[Davis, Andrew] Acadia Univ, Dept Econ, Wolfville, NS, Canada; [Kim, Jiseob] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Acadia University; Yonsei University,"Davis, A (通讯作者)，Acadia Univ, Dept Econ, Wolfville, NS, Canada.",andrew.davis@acadiau.ca; jiseob83@gmail.com,,"Kim, Jiseob/0000-0002-5317-0412",,,,,23,5,5,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Evidence from a unique field experiment,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fundraising; Competition; Direct mailing; Field experiment,IMPURE ALTRUISM; DIRECT MAILINGS; WARM-GLOW; DONATIONS,"Charitable organizations send out large volumes of direct mailings, soliciting for money in support of many good causes. Without any request, donations are rarely made, and it is well known that each request for money by a charity likely generates at least some revenues. Whether a single request from a charity increases the total amount donated by an individual is however unknown. Indeed, a response to one request can hurt responses to others. The net effect is therefore not easily observable, certainly not when multiple charities address the same individuals. In this paper we alleviate these observational difficulties by carrying out a field experiment in which five large charities cooperate. With the unique data that we collect, we study the impact of sending more requests on total donations. The results indicate that there is a negative competitive effect on requests from other charities, but this effect dies out rapidly. Soon after the mailing has been sent, it is only a strong cannibalization of the charity's own revenues that prevails. This empirical finding suggests the important conclusion that not much coordination across charities is needed to increase revenues. We also demonstrate that charities need sophisticated evaluation tools that do not ignore the effects of cannibalization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This effect is still detectable in today's distribution of urbanization and economic activity even though the risk of malaria falciparum has been successfully eliminated. We do not find any indication of convergence between high-and low malaria potential regions after eradication. Our identification strategy relies on a climate-based measure of Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission intensity which is fitted to experimental data on mosquito and parasite development from laboratory studies.

To understand this issue, we analyze a Bayesian signaling model of an agent who cares about self-image and has the opportunity to learn the social benefits of a personally costly action. We show that willful ignorance can serve as an excuse for selfish behavior by obfuscating the signal about the decision-maker's preferences, and help maintain the idea that the agent would have acted virtuously under full information. We derive several behavioral predictions that are inconsistent with either outcome-based preferences or social-image concern and conduct experiments to test them.

We consider an out-of-sample period of 1970:Q3 to 2014:Q4, with a corresponding in-sample period of 1947:Q2 to 1970:Q2. We employ a quantile predictive regression model. The quantile-based approach is more informative relative to any linear model, as it investigates the ability of the current account to forecast the entire conditional distribution of the equity premium, rather than being restricted to just the conditional-mean. In addition, we employ a recursive estimation of both the conditional-mean and quantile predictive regression models over the out-of-sample period which allows for time-varying parameters in the forecast evaluation part of the sample for both of these models. Our results indicate that unlike as suggested by the linear (mean-based) predictive regression model, the quantile regression model shows that the (changes in the) real current account balance contains significant out-of-sample information when the stock market is performing poorly (below the quantile value of 0.3), but not when the market is in normal to bullish modes (quantile value above 0.3). This result seems to be intuitive in the sense that, when the markets are performing average to well, that is performing around the median and above of the conditional distribution of the equity premium, the excess return is inherently a random-walk and hence, no information, from a predictor (changes in the real current account balance) is able to predict the equity premium.","[Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Majumdar, Anandamayee] Soochow Univ, Ctr Adv Stat & Econometr, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business Adm, 6708 Pine St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",University of Pretoria; Soochow University - China; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; anandamayee.majumdar@gmail.com; mwohar@unomaha.edu,,,,,,,21,9,9,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

McGrattan and Schmitz's (1999) survey on 'Capital and Repair Expenditures' in Canada indicates that maintenance expenditures account for a substantial fraction of output and new investment. It is shown that the endogenous maintenance expenditures reduce the requirement of the degree of increasing returns to scale to generate sunspot equilibria. In fact, the minimum level of the returns to scale required could be as low as 1.0179. This aspect is important since empirical works such as Basu and Fernald (1997) suggest that returns to scale is close to constant.","[Jiang, Dou] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University of Finance & Economics,"Jiang, D (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Int Acad Business & Econ, 25 Zhujiang Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",dou.jiang@uqconnect.edu.au,"Jiang, Dou/K-3215-2019",,,,,,12,0,0,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In this paper, we explore the role of international trade in its wage inequality dynamics over the 1998-2012 period, using a unique household panel survey. Our analysis reveals that most of the overall wage inequality occurs within sectors and educational groups rather than between them. However, the share in total inequality of the between variation across sectors and educational groups has moderately increased over time. Furthermore, we document that almost the entire aggregate wage inequality in both manufacturing and services occurs within different trade-exposure categories rather than between them, and this pattern is persistent through time. These results suggest that international trade might not be the main driving force behind the rising wage dispersion in South Korea in the last two decades. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The typical procedure of equating the after-tax return on traded bonds to the rate of time preference involves imposing an arbitrary and constraining knife-edge condition. This paper replaces the infinitely lived representative agent framework with a plausible demographic structure. This yields a well-behaved macrodynamic equilibrium without imposing any knife-edge conditions. The equilibrium dynamics generated by the Rectangular survival function, characteristic of the Samuelson-Diamond model, closely track those corresponding to an empirically estimated survival function. However, the Blanchard survival function tracks the data poorly in terms of absolute levels, while the closeness of its relative dynamics (following a structural change) depends on the source of the structural change.","[Oxborrow, David; Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Box 353330,Savery 305, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,,sturn@u.washington.edu,,,Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington,Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington,"Turnovsky's research was supported in part by the Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington.

But there is uncertainty over how large China's military spending is relative to other countries, or how fast it is growing in real terms. We address this issue by deriving a relative military cost price index based on the relative unit costs of inputs. We find that China's real military spending is much larger than suggested by exchange rate comparisons, and even larger than standard purchasing power parity comparisons. We also find, however, that the real growth of China's military spending has been smaller than conventionally thought. This is due to rapidly growing wages in China and the large share of personnel in China's military budget.","[Robertson, Peter E.; Sin, Adrian] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Robertson, PE (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Perth, WA, Australia.",peter.robertson@uwa.edu.au,,"Robertson, peter/0000-0002-0424-6732",,,,,77,19,20,2,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

It is significant with conflict count in the terrorism data-set and insignificant for data on armed conflict. Inclusion of youth bulge and unemployment rate confirms the marginalization hypothesis of conflict. Inflation rate and the tax variables are insignificant. This confirms that aid erodes fiscal capacity. At project-level data, conflict is strongly related with aid commitment and purpose.

I consider two popular and competing money demand specifications - the log-log and the semi-log - and show that the log-log performs better than the semi-log in its ability to track the behavior of the money demand. The choice between the two specifications is of great importance, as it implies that welfare cost estimates are very different for hyperinflation. The findings also contribute to the understanding of Cagan's paradox and the failure of Cagan inflationary finance models. The paradox might be attributable to the popular semi-log schedule for money demand, and the log-log schedule might be an appropriate form for the analysis of hyperinflation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper firstly introduces a brief elucidation about RG and the concept of independence principle. By way of presenting factual backgrounds, legal and policy evaluation and analyses, this paper covered all issues and disputes arising out of one shipbuilding contract and the independent RG drawn from the shipbuilding contract, through in-depth cases studies of a judicial case on the matter of independence principle of RG between the beneficiary (the buyer or its assignee) and the guarantor reviewed by an English court, an arbitration case regarding whether the beneficiary (the buyer or its assignee) has any right of refund in the event of the acceptance of a repudiatory breach by the applicant (the builder) in the London Maritime Arbitrators Association, and the beneficiary (the buyer or its assignee)' s appeal to an English court against the award and a judicial case reviewing whether the guarantor has right of reimbursement in accordance with the terms of the export bond insurance with the Korean ECA. Findings - While most RGs, in practice, are drawn as an independent guarantee which is payable on call without any evidence of default, there is another payment scheme in RGs, such as payment upon the submission of an arbitral award which may enhance the application of RGs in shipbuilding contracts. The paper suggested that under these circumstances, Korean builders may opt to make their shipbuilding contract be governed by Korean laws, with the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board as a competent arbitral jurisdiction and forum as far as possible. Originality/value - This paper proposes prudent approaches and considerations in the issuance and application of RGs which are independent from shipbuilding contracts. The hope is to increase awareness in the utility of arbitration system as well as for fiduciary Korean banks and ECAs to play a more pivotal role in guiding shipbuilding industry stakeholders.","[Ahn, Keon-Hyung] Daejeon Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Pil Joon] KSURE, Seoul, South Korea",Daejeon University,"Kim, PJ (通讯作者)，KSURE, Seoul, South Korea.",kpj0326@ksure.or.kr,"AHN, Keon-Hyung/F-3955-2016",,Daejeon University fund [20173578],Daejeon University fund,This research was supported by Daejeon University fund (20173578).,,23,2,3,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Using non-linear autoregressive distributed lag approach, this article investigates the asymmetric effects of oil price shocks on the demand of money in Saudi Arabia over the period 1990:Q1-2014:Q4. The empirical results show evidence of positive long run but asymmetric effects of oil price shocks on the money demand. In particular, we find that the positive oil price shocks are more important than negative shocks. Therefore, two policy responses can be considered: either sustaining the fixed exchange rate regime and following an economic diversification policy or switching towards a flexible exchange rate regime to achieve price stability. In that case, the existence of a stable money demand function in Saudi Arabia is a necessary precondition for adopting a monetary policy strategy targeted to price stability using instruments like money targeting.","[Alsamara, Mouyad; Mrabet, Zouhair; Barkat, Karim] Qatar Univ, Finance & Econ Dept, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Dombrecht, Michel] Univ Antwerp, Dept Econ, Antwerp, Belgium; [Dombrecht, Michel] Hub Brussels, Antwerp, Belgium",Qatar University; University of Antwerp,"Alsamara, M (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Finance & Econ Dept, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",malsamara@qu.edu.qa,"AL SAMARA, Mouyad/M-9499-2019","AL SAMARA, Mouyad/0000-0002-3753-1361; Barkat, Karim/0000-0003-4893-5801",,,,,68,26,28,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As a result, endogenous money models still have serious limitations today. On the one hand, the bank loan markup and the loan interest rate are exogenous in the horizontalist model, which supposes that they do not depend on the money/liquidity market conditions (as if bank loans did not compete with the existing liquidity). On the other hand, although interest rates are endogenous in the structuralist model, they result from inappropriate treatment of the loan supply and money/liquidity supply. This article aims to remove these shortcomings. It offers a theoretical framework and formal modeling where the creditworthy demand for loans determines the bank loan supply, given the central bank refinancing interest rate, while the total supply and demand for liquidity-money determines the markup and the market rate of interest in accordance with Keynes's liquidity preference theory. In this framework, the post Keynesian theory of endogenous money and Keynes's verticalist view prove to be analytically complementary.","[Asensio, Angel] Univ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Ctr Econ Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris 13,"Asensio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Ctr Econ Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France.",,,,,,,,23,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In the article TOPSIS method was implemented. In the case of every multiple-criteria analysis tasks a basic dilemma relates to the problem of applying weights for variables used in the research, which should be appropriate for their importance in forming the measured phenomenon. To solve that problem two approaches were applied: a) the TOSPIS method with equal weights for all the variables was used; b) the TOPSIS method was extended with Shannon entropy and objective weights concept.

As a policy of increased worker autonomy, SMWT can theoretically increase effort via intrinsic motivation and reciprocal behaviour, but it can also lead to a decrease of effort due to a loss of control. Based on German individual-level panel data, we find that SMWT employees exert higher effort levels than employees with fixed working hours. Even after accounting for observed and unobserved characteristics there remains a modest positive effect. This effect is largely driven by employees who are intrinsically motivated, suggesting that intrinsic motivation is complementary to SMWT. However, reciprocal work intensification does not seem to be an important channel of providing extra effort. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using firm-level data for a substantial number of OECD countries from the late 1990s to late 2000s, the analysis reveals nonlinear effects of both sectoral import penetration and de jure product market regulation measures, depending on firms' positions along the global distribution of productivity. Close to the technology frontier, import penetration has a strongly positive effect on firm-level productivity growth, with less stringent domestic regulation enhancing this effect substantially. However, far from the frontier, the effect of import penetration on firm-level productivity growth is much smaller and often not significant. Its interaction with domestic regulation generally has no statistically significant effect either. The heterogeneous effects of import penetration and domestic product market regulation on firm-level productivity growth are consistent with a neo-Schumpeterian view of trade and regulation.","[Ben Yahmed, Sarra] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Dougherty, Sean] OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France; [Dougherty, Sean] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Paris School of Economics,"Ben Yahmed, S (通讯作者)，ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany.;Dougherty, S (通讯作者)，OECD Econ Dept, Paris, France.;Dougherty, S (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",ben-yahmed@zew.de; sean.dougherty@oecd.org,"Yahmed, Sarra Ben/AAV-1841-2020","Yahmed, Sarra Ben/0000-0002-3949-0997; Dougherty, Sean/0000-0002-3297-8359",,,,,44,9,11,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The novelty of our article resides in the multifaceted analysis we propose combining both qualitative and empirical methods, in the comprehensive sample of EU countries, and in the large time horizon we consider. We first assess the relationship between public financial resources allocated to higher education and socio-economic indicators by means of an exploratory technique, called cluster analysis. Our findings reveal a pattern of similarity among EU countries by building smaller but homogenous groups. We then use the vector autoregressive method to complement the cluster analysis by providing further information on the strength, sign, and causal relationship between government expenditure in tertiary education and several socio-economic indicators. We perform an analysis for each country in the sample. Our findings are mixed, with some countries displaying a greater sensitivity of public financing (channeled to higher education) to changes in socio-economic indicators.","[Campeanu, Emilia; Dumitrescu, Dalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance & Banking, Bucharest, Romania; [Costica, Ionela; Boitan, Iustina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Câmpeanu, E (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Finance & Banking, Bucharest, Romania.",,"costica, ionela/Q-5039-2019; Dumitrescu, Dalina/F-9911-2016; Campeanu, Emilia Mioara/H-3595-2014; Boitan, Iustina Alina/AAY-4762-2020; boitan, iustina a/A-2326-2015","Boitan, Iustina Alina/0000-0001-6510-5063;",,,,,35,4,4,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We propose a market-based approach for assessing the usefulness of this indicator to improve investors' decisions. Specifically, we examine the association between accruals quality and information asymmetry among stock market participants. Our empirical study uses data on European firms and our results are consistent with a positive association between poor earnings quality and high information asymmetry. However, given some previous studies suggesting that accruals-based measures may be noisy indicators of earnings quality, we develop a method to increase the informational content of the accruals quality measure.

This approach highlights the role of three components observed simultaneously in order to understand the emergence of hyperinflation: a virulent distributive conflict; the presence of indexing mechanisms; and finally, flight from domestic currency into one or more foreign currencies. The article reveals that a transitional economy like that of Bulgaria in the 1990s may generate hyperinflation in the absence of any violent distribution conflict: the transition and the banking crisis engender inflation. The foreign exchange rate is decisive in the emergence of hyperinflationary dynamics (and therefore mistrust of domestic currency). This interpretation of hyperinflation is confirmed by an econometric analysis.","[Charles, Sebastien] Univ Paris 08, LED, St Denis, France; [Marie, Jonathan] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Villetaneuse, France",Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paris 13,"Charles, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, LED, St Denis, France.;Marie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Villetaneuse, France.",sebastien.charles03@univ-paris8.fr; jonathan.marie@univ-paris13.fr,,"Charles, Sebastien/0009-0000-4104-135X; Marie, Jonathan/0009-0000-1105-8177",,,,,44,4,4,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,3,,,,,313,335,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1339476,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FB9SJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406479000004,0

Also, research methods are explicated; the scale-free networks and the theory of strong ties are integrated; the features of supply chain networks are considered from single statistical parameters and comprehensive analyses. Next, we provide numeric simulation of the properties of supply chain networks, verifying the accuracy of parameter analyses of single statistics and comprehensive analyses. Ultimately, when coping with supply chain disruption risk, each node enterprise of supply chain network is supposed to deploy the characteristics of scale-free networks to systematically manage existing weak ties, weak ties newly introduced, existing strong ties and strong ties newly introduced. This study is conducive to node enterprises of supply chains to recognize and apply the scale-free networks and the strength theory of ties to analyze the properties of supply chain networks, and to improve the capacity to cope with disruption risk.","[Chen, Youyu; Shu, Tong; Chen, Shou; Wang, Shouyang] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Youyu] Hunan Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gan, Lu] Hunan Univ, Off Humanities & Social Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China","Hunan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Shaanxi Normal University; University of Hong Kong; Hunan University","Shu, T (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",shutong@hnu.edu.cn,"Gan, Lu/JXX-1314-2024; Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-0014-2095; Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71172194, 71521061, 71390330, 71390331, 71571065]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-13-0193]; Ministry of Education in China of Humanities and Social Science Project [14YJA630077]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Ministry of Education in China of Humanities and Social Science Project,"This paper is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71172194, 71521061, 71390330, 71390331, 71571065), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University under Grant No. NCET-13-0193 and the Ministry of Education in China of Humanities and Social Science Project under Grant No. 14YJA630077.",,38,8,12,10,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

U.S. law requires employers to use a common price, but the value of insurance varies with idiosyncratic health risk. Hence, linking employment and health insurance creates a wedge between the marginal cost and benefit of insurance. We study the impact of this wedge on occupational choice and welfare in a general equilibrium model. Agents face idiosyncratic health expenditure shocks, have or managerial and worker productivity, and choose whether to be workers or entrepreneurs. First, we consider a private insurance indemnity policy that removes the link between employment and health insurance, so only ability matters for occupational choice. By construction, this is the most efficient policy. We find a welfare gain of 2.28% from decoupling health insurance and employment. Second, we tighten the link by increasing employment-based health insurance from the current U.S. level of 62% to 100%, and find a welfare loss of - 0.61%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Most of the time, the analysis is made at the aggregated level, by large regions or states, where there are more data available. However, when there is a wide intra-regional heterogeneity, it is possible to have regional convergence coexisting with local processes of divergence. This is our hypothesis for the case of Brazil, where there are relevant different intra-state behaviours. To capture these behaviours in this article, an adaptation of multilevel techniques to the beta-Convergence analysis is proposed using data of Brazilian states and municipalities taken from the Economic Census (1991 to 2010). With this data, we confirm the existence of convergence at the national level, but we can observe that this general trend coexists with different intra-state behaviours across Brazilian geography. The most industrialized or urbanized states of the Southeast usually present internal divergence, while the less developed inland states normally show convergence, which agrees with what we expect from the central/periphery models.","[Dapena, Alberto Diaz; Morollon, Fernando Rubiera] Univ Oviedo, REGIOlab Reg Econ Lab, Oviedo, Spain; [Pires, Monica de Moura; Gomes, Andrea da Silva] UESC Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Ilheus, Brazil",University of Oviedo; Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz,"Morollón, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, REGIOlab Reg Econ Lab, Oviedo, Spain.",frubiera@uniovi.es,"Pires, Monica/ABR-8957-2022","Pires, Monica/0000-0002-7049-9930; Pires, Monica/0000-0001-9036-514X; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando/0000-0002-4854-0802; Diaz-Dapena, Alberto/0000-0001-9343-5166","Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion [MINECO-13-ECO2013-48161-R]","Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion","This work was supported by the Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion [MINECO-13-ECO2013-48161-R].",,60,10,14,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use CEX consumption data and a factor model to characterize the cyclical dynamics of the consumption distribution. We first ensure that our approach closely matches business cycle fluctuations of consumption from the National Account. We then study the responses of the consumption distribution to TFP shocks and various uncertainty shocks. Importantly, we find that the right tail of the consumption distribution, comprised mostly of highly educated individuals, has a larger and quicker response than other parts of the distribution to shocks that drive cyclical fluctuations. We note that the cost of business cycle fluctuations, calculated using the full distribution of consumption, is larger than the cost found using aggregate consumption. Further, the shocks we analyze reduce consumption inequality on impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

At the same time, the effect of oil price shocks on stock price returns has become a prominent issue due to surges in energy prices. Using the Brazilian corporate sustainability index (ISE) as a benchmark for socially responsible investments in the Brazilian stock market, the present study extends the understandings on the impact of oil prices on stock price behaviour, focusing on a new class of assets: those from socially responsible firms. To this end, apart from conventional linear causality approaches, we apply a nonparametric test by Diks and Panchenko (DP) on daily data spanning from January 2008 to December 2015 to test for non-linear causality, before and after controlling for conditional heteroscedasticity. Our findings show that, in spite of their efforts to become more socially responsible, firms that have adhered to the ISE in recent years are influenced by crude oil spot prices, especially the WTI crude. In line with previous studies, we also provide consistent evidence that the Brazilian stock market, as a whole, is associated with the international crude oil market.","[de Oliveira, E.

Furthermore, these RTAs are dominated by countries with a small share of total exports destined for intraregional trade flows. Our study focuses on the welfare effects of RTAs (pertaining to trade creation and trade diversion) among this group of countries. We use a theoretically justified gravity model to estimate welfare effects, focusing on trade creation and trade diversion and deviating from the norm in related studies, accounting for heterogeneity in third countries. Using ECOWAS as a sample, we estimate welfare effects on 1992-2012 annual bilateral imports for 14 countries from 169 countries. Contrary to conventional expectations in the literature, we find that economic integration among small and relatively low-income countries that have a small share of total trade with each other is welfare-improving for the members as a group, for the majority of the individual member countries, and for some third countries. Accounting for heterogeneity in third countries reveals that an RTA among low-income countries has a particularly robust trade-creation effect.","[Deme, Mamit; Ndrianasy, Estrella R.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Jones Coll Business, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Deme, M (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jones Coll Business, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",mamit.deme@mtsu.edu,,,,,,,44,13,14,4,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article examines age- and gender-specific unemployment rates in Central and Eastern European countries by using Okun's law. It tests the hypothesis that young people are more vulnerable to business cycle fluctuations. Gender- and age-specific Okun coefficients for ten different countries plus the EU-15 are estimated. The results show that young people in the CEE countries are predominantly more sensitive to business cycle fluctuations, independent of gender.","[Dunsch, Sophie] European Univ Viadrina, Fac Business & Econ, Particular Econ Theory Macroecon, Chair Econ, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany",European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder,"Dunsch, S (通讯作者)，Stiftung Europa Univ Viadrina, Gross Scharrnstr 59, D-15230 Frankfurt, Germany.",dunsch@europa-uni.de,,,,,,,33,12,12,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Extending the constant elasticity demand model to consider cross-elasticity leads to notably different results regarding tax revenue maximization. With nonzero but weak cross-elasticity effects relative to the price elasticity, we derive a higher optimal tax-price ratio compared to prior research. With strong cross-elasticity, revenue can continually be increased by raising the excise tax. Overall, the study offers government greater incentive to use excise taxes to obtain revenue.","[Dutkowsky, Donald H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Sullivan, Ryan S.] Naval Postgrad Sch, Def Resources Management Inst, Monterey, CA USA",Syracuse University; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Sullivan, RS (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Dept Econ, 231 Halligan Hall, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",rssulliv@nps.edu,,,,,,,4,4,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Thus the tragedy of the commons is resolved by governing the commons. In this paper we argue that there is also the possibility of a tragedy of governing the commons. If political institutions lock participants into a certain pattern of resource use, and then there is an exogenous shock say, a technological change - that increases the risks to one group, then the situation may no longer be a classic common-pool situation and institutions may actually exacerbate, rather than ameliorate distributional conflict. We develop a general model showing that whenever there is heterogeneity in private risks, some technological innovation could potentially turn a previously stable institution into a source of conflict. We take the compelling recent example of horizontal hydrofracturing changing the welfare implications of the institution of compulsory pooling, and use a new individual-level dataset of landowners affected by compulsory pooling in New York to demonstrate the empirical support for our model.

The analysis uses a two-stage instrumental variable quantile regression approach and is based on each HBS cross section, as well as the overall pooled observations. The estimated elasticities are compared across low-and high-energy-consumption scenarios and to a benchmark elasticity estimated using two-stage least squares. The results provide evidence that there is significant variation in the income elasticities across the energy expenditure distribution and that care must be taken when using the constant mean elasticity for policy purposes. More specifically, any examination of the future impact of a change in income support policy measures on energy consumption should recognize the substantial context-dependent variation in the income elasticity.","[Harold, J.; Cullinan, J.] Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Lyons, S.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Lyons, S.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Harold, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland.",j.harold2@nuigalway.ie,"Lyons, Sean/AAH-7579-2019","Lyons, Sean/0000-0002-3526-6947; Cullinan, John/0000-0003-3509-0635; Harold, Jason/0000-0002-4419-2687",Irish Research Council (IRC),"Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",This research was funded by the Irish Research Council (IRC).,,22,13,13,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Prices of traded assets tend to cluster on certain final digits, such as 0 and 5. In Chinese culture, 8 is associated with good luck and 4 with death so these numbers may be attractive or avoided. We find that price clustering on the final digit of 0 is significantly higher during the morning call auction and early in the trading day. We find no evidence of price clustering for the digit 8, but there is a significant dearth of prices ending in the inauspicious number 4. Price clustering is significantly higher for negotiated block trades, for which about 28% end with 0. Multivariate analysis shows that price clustering is lower for more liquid firms, but higher for firms with higher return volatility, a higher price level, or when the market is volatile.

The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, firms who have better access to any finance are more likely to export and export more. More financial options lead to a higher export probability and capacity due to the complementary relation between financial options. Second, of all financial options, the internal finance captured by cash holdings or profit plays the most important role on firms' export likelihood and volume. Firms rely more on the external finance through borrowing to start exporting, but depend more on issuing stocks to their shareholders to expand their exports. Third, subsample results suggest that the financial option of issuing stocks is generally more important for firms who have worse access to external finance in determining export propensity and quantity, such as private-owned firms, small-scale firms, young firms, and non-eastern firms.","[Huang, Xiaobing] Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaolian] Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Hist & Tourism, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Gannan Normal University; Gannan Normal University,"Huang, XB (通讯作者)，Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",huangxiaobing1234@126.com,"XIONG, LIU/JOK-5886-2023; zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71663003],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),National Natural Science Foundation of China 71663003,,45,4,4,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The sectoral structure of business in the region seems to be a very important one. Our research is focused on identifying the key similarities and differences in sectoral business structure in the regions of Slovakia. We analyse the current situation in NUTS 4 regions and applied cluster analysis in order to group these regions into clusters based on observed similarities in business structure. These could be useful, especially for setting the regional innovation policy and innovation support in the regions. Our results suggest that regions in Slovakia could be divided at least into 7 groups according to business structure. Each group have some specific characteristics and therefore should be treated separately in respect to their innovation potential.

Aggregate consumption and aggregate savings have powerful influence on an economy's long-term productive capacity and capture the macroeconomic fluctuations and business cycles more appropriately. This interest reflects the belief that the structural forms of consumption functions and theories are a key to solve many business cycle issues. This study provides a time series analysis of aggregate consumption function for Pakistan by using a quarterly data from 1973(1) to 2010(4). The DHSY's error correction and Hall's random walk models are empirically tested. The data validate the application of both methodologies in estimating the aggregate consumption function. Hall's martingale hypothesis also holds showing that current consumption is a good predictor of future consumption in Pakistan. In the context of Pakistan, 86% of the income has been consumed in the long run while the rest is saving. Inflation is unanticipated but is not accelerating. The data provide enough evidence to reject the price homogeneity hypothesis, however we are unable to reject the hypothesis of the unit elasticity of income. The Mankiw and Campbell test concludes that there are 49% of consumers who are backward looking while 51% follow permanent income hypothesis and are forward looking.","[Islam, Tanweer] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Zafar, Zakia] Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Kotli, Pakistan",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Islam, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan.",,"Islam, Tanweer/AAU-2748-2020","Islam, Tanweer/0000-0001-7398-0757",,,,,39,1,2,0,5,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Despite constant GDP shares, the military expenditure could not sustain a large and properly armed mobilization army. The constant nominal defence budgets of the 1990s accentuated the Norwegian Armed Forces' underlying imbalance between tasks, structure and budget. Around year 2000, large organizational reforms were effectuated, in which costs, the number of man-years, and underlying imbalances between tasks, structure and budget were reduced.

In a period when public sector employment in Britain was contracting sharply, the short-term returns to training are nonetheless greater in the public sector, while the medium-term returns for both public sector and private sector employees depend on remaining within sector.

An application to economic justice,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC METHODOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ethics education; fairness; justice; teaching ethics; questionnaire; experiment,INSTRUCTION; FAIR,"Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in initiatives to expand ethics instruction in higher education. Numerous empirical studies have examined the possible effects on students of discipline-based ethics instruction, such business ethics and medical ethics. Nevertheless, the largest share of college ethics instruction has traditionally fallen to philosophy departments, and there is a paucity of empirical research on the individual effects of that approach. This paper examines possible effects of exposure to readings and lectures in mandatory philosophy classes on student views of morality. Specifically, it focuses on an ethical topic of importance to both economics and philosophy, viz. economic (or distributive) justice. The questionnaire study is designed to avoid features suspected of generating false positives in past research while calibrating the measurement so as to increase the likelihood of detecting even a modest true effect. The results provide little evidence that the philosophical ethics approach studied here systematically affects the fairness views of students. The possible implications for future research and for ethics instruction are briefly discussed.","[Konow, James] Univ Kiel, Chair Econ & Ethics, Kiel, Germany; [Konow, James] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, One LMU Dr,Suite 4200, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",University of Kiel; Loyola Marymount University,"Konow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Chair Econ & Ethics, Kiel, Germany.;Konow, J (通讯作者)，Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, One LMU Dr,Suite 4200, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",jkonow@lmu.edu,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

In this article, we focus on the so-called excess co-movement, which is the correlation between crude oil price and the prices of food commodities after controlling for economic activity. We use a frequency domain Granger causality test to analyse short-run and long-run relationships between crude oil prices and prices of food commodities. For important biofuel inputs like maize, soybeans, rapeseed and EU sugar, we find evidence for long-run Granger causality in particular for the period after 2007. This supports the hypothesis that the increasing biofuel production creates the link between the prices of crude oil and food commodities. However, we also find short-run Granger causality for various food commodities.

This method has strong limitations in the presence of negative incomes, which were not discussed by the original authors and have been widely overlooked in successive studies. Through theoretical argumentation and practical examples, this article shows that, when using negative incomes, (1) the original decomposition formulae become inappropriate, (2) the marginal effects analysis may yield erroneous results and (3) the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers' is not always met. This has critical implications for policy development, given that strategies based upon incorrect analyses could actually result in undesired greater income inequalities. The Gini source decomposition should be carefully applied by researchers and policymakers, especially in rural developing areas, where negative incomes are common due to financial losses from agricultural activities.","[Manero, Ana] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Manero, Ana] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Australian National University; University of South Australia,"Manero, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",ana.manero@anu.edu.au,"Manero, Ana/ACA-4950-2022","Manero, Ana/0000-0002-3636-9534",,,,,14,6,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Under reasonable market conditions, we show that industries with a few buyers induce more upstream entry than industries with a larger number of firms. In particular, monopsony can be more conducive to entry and lead to higher social welfare than more fragmented industry structures. This seeming paradox arises because a single buyer better internalizes the positive effects of entry on later-periods' supply conditions than a collection of firms.

These two variables are negatively related when the workers are young and have a positive relationship when they are matured adults. This conclusion remains valid for both men and women. Our robustness check further confirms that workers respond to wage increases differently at different stages of their working career. This has interesting policy implications.

In the case of a merit good, it is legitimate for the government to interfere with consumer preferences.

The extensive positive externalities of entrepreneurship, such as innovation or increased productivity, have made researchers be interested in the conditions and motivations that can determine it to flourish. Many empirical studies test the relations between the entrepreneurial activity and different determinant variables, but the empirical results are mixed and sometimes contradictory, especially for developing versus developed countries. This can make public policy makers confused and misguided. In this article, we are interested in identifying the factors that influence the dynamics of entrepreneurship, aiming to understand whether there is a set of common factors globally, which explain entrepreneurship development. We use the density of newly registered companies for a set of 57 countries for yearly observations from 2004 to 2012, as a proxy for entrepreneurship development. Our conclusions indicate that the bankruptcies, the economic situation, the producer prices and competitiveness are directly influencing the new density, while the wages, the bank lendings to the private sector, the bankruptcies and the leading indicator show cointegration with the new density. We consider this as evidence that there is a common set of determinants that affect entrepreneurship development. Such an analysis at global level increases knowledge in the entrepreneurship research, as it has the merit to inquire into the nature and conditions of entrepreneurship as a universal human behavior, in the countries of the world.","[Nicolae, Mariana; Ion, Irina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Lupu, Radu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Inst Econ Forecasting, Romanian Acad, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Lupu, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Inst Econ Forecasting, Romanian Acad, Bucharest, Romania.",radu.lupu@rei.ase.ro,"Lupu, Radu/AAZ-5907-2020; Irina, Ion C/C-6063-2011; Lupu, Radu/H-4389-2014","Lupu, Radu/0000-0002-2231-1753",,,,,10,2,2,0,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The analytical part will focus on a comparison of single-parent families compared to the total number of the family households. The age and gender of the single-parent will be a complementary factor in this analysis. The second part of the analysis will focus on projection of the number of single-parents families in 2050. The essential source for this study are the data from Labour Force survey. LFS is a continuous survey with the possibility of resulting value on an annual basis unlike Census. The headship rate according to age groups and the relative share of individual types of households will be used as a basic methodological approach for this study.

At present we lack a framework for organizing such multilateral collaboration. Global challenges relate to the consumption of 'common-pool' or 'common property' resources. It is often held that such resources involve a 'tragedy of the commons' for which the proposed solutions are usually full state control or privatization. However, the late Elinor Ostrom argued that the state/market approach to the commons is flawed conceptually and empirically. In multiple studies she showed that resources are often managed collectively through negotiation and collaboration among 'polycentric' agents. This paper aims to outline the conceptual approach, to suggest that it can be scaled up to the world level as an approach to the global challenges, and to propose an agenda for research on major innovation challenges involved.","[Smith, Keith] Imperial Coll, Sch Business, London, England",Imperial College London,"Smith, K (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, Sch Business, London, England.",keith.smith@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,13,14,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Results show that there exists the 'rocket and feather' effect in the adjustment of retail prices of most beef grades and cuts in response to changes in wholesale prices, and such asymmetric adjustment effect is more pronounced for higher quality grade (Choice) than lower quality grade (Select). Evidence of similar price adjustment is found from the high-quality cut (sirloin). Our results underscore the differences in price adjustment by product quality in the US beef industry.","[Surathkal, Prasanna; Chung, Chanjin] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Chung, CJ (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",chanjin.chung@okstate.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [OKL02941]; Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University; Oklahoma State University Agricultural Experiment Station [OKL02941],USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University; Oklahoma State University Agricultural Experiment Station,"This research was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Hatch project, [OKL02941]) and the Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University; Oklahoma State University Agricultural Experiment Station [OKL02941].",,39,4,4,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Spatial Economic Analysis. Local economic growth tends to affect neighbourhood house prices unevenly. It has been observed that prime locations experience price hikes far in excess of the surrounding local area. Yet, this phenomenon is not well captured by existing economic models. This research provides a model of spatial and temporal interactions between housing and employment markets. The results show that rapid growth of employment centres increases house prices in neighbouring locations even after adjusting for fundamentals. It is concluded that spatial clustering of companies creates an option value for existing and potential employees that goes beyond ease of access for commuting purposes.","[Szumilo, Nikodem; Fuerst, Franz] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [Laszkiewicz, Edyta] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland; [Fuerst, Franz] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Planning, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of Lodz; University of Melbourne,"Szumilo, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England.",ns528@cam.ac.uk,"Fuerst, Franz/C-8827-2009","Fuerst, Franz/0000-0003-2780-938X; Laszkiewicz, Edyta/0000-0001-8833-3624",Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE),Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)),The authors thank the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for providing funding for a project which inspired this study.,,66,7,7,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

By employing a methodology that estimates the persistence of inflation by allowing (i) fractional integration and (ii) persistence and level shifts in the series, we aim to define whether it is stationary and/or mean reverting and, if so, during which periods. The results of our analysis for the period 1987-2015 are threefold: firstly, inflation in the eighties and nineties should be seen as a highly persistent yet mean-reverting process (not a random walk); secondly, inflation remained mean reverting, though became a short-memory (less persistent) process around the date of the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework of 2001; thirdly, during the later phase, the level of inflation also decreased and is now within the inflation target range set by Banco de Mexico, namely 3 per cent with an interval of +/-1 percentage point.","[Ventosa-Santaularia, Daniel] CIDE, Div Econ, Carretera Mexico,Toluca 3655 Col Lomas Santa Fe, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Gomez-Zaldivar, Manuel] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finanzas, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Chavez, Pedro] CEMLA, Gerencia Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

The examination of exhaustive micro-level data reveals that small (uninformed, retail) investors earn higher initial returns than large investors. Before the enacting of the 'Claw-Back' provision, small investors were unfavourably treated in relation to large investors. The pattern now prevailing in the proportion of shares allocated to small and large investors also differs from that observed previously. When attempting to isolate the determinants of IPO underpricing in Hong Kong, the article also shows that both the 'informed demand' hypothesis and the signalling effect of underwriters' reputation are significant determinants of underpricing. Such result, not visible when pooled OLS regressions are used, becomes apparent through the use of a system of simultaneous equations.","[Vong, Anna P.

We examine whether university students pursuing health-related degrees, who hypothetically should have more exposure to and understanding of the risks associated with unplanned pregnancy and STD, have more risk averse attitudes to sexual behaviour. We find that health students' sexual attitudes are significantly more risk averse than those of their nonhealth peers in relation to STDs but not unplanned pregnancy. In line with previous research, age and no previous sexual history (virginity) appear to increase risk-averse attitudes to both unplanned pregnancy and STDs. Moreover, males and singles are more risk seeking in their sexual attitudes.

I analyse to what extent a permanent increase in government debt that is financed by higher taxes could raise the long-run natural real interest rate. As a measurement tool, I use an incomplete markets model with capital and government bonds. Increasing the public debt/GDP ratio by one percentage point raises the real interest rate by between 0.4 and 1.5 basis points, depending on the degree of inequality generated by the model and the tax instrument used to balance the government's budget constraint. I also show that the interest rate effect of a change in public debt/GDP predicted by the model is significantly smaller than its empirical counterpart for the US, due to the fact that the model understates the empirical fraction of households that are constrained in their consumption decision.","[Winter, Christoph] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Off SOF G-27,Schonberggasse 1, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Winter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Off SOF G-27,Schonberggasse 1, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",christoph.winter@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This paper revisits this issue by using a DSGE-VAR approach, combining both theoretical and empirical methods. We present that the DSGE approach (estimated with the Bayesian technique) and the Bayesian VAR with the Minnesota Prior both lead to worse in-sample fit than our proposed DSGE-VAR framework. The DSGE-VAR approach reveals that a positive military spending shock boosts the U.S. economy, increasing per capita real GDP growth, consumption, inflation and interest rate. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications. Future investigations such as exploring an optimal military spending policy could adopt the approach in this paper to determine the best model - empirical, theoretical, or a combination of the two.","[Wu, Yi-Hua; Lin, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Ho, Chih-Chin; Lin, Eric S.] Natl Taipei Univ, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Eric S.] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lin, Eric S.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Social Sci, Res Ctr Publ Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; National Taipei University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; National Taiwan University,"Lin, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 102-2410-H-007-011-MY2],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This work was supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan [grant number NSC 102-2410-H-007-011-MY2].,,32,3,3,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Data for 266 open-end funds were selected from China's capital market between 2008 and 2014. The R/S analysis method and the box fractal dimension were utilised to produce a drift index of investment style (DIIS). Based on the empirical results, three conclusions are noteworthy. First, the six types of pure style CITIC assets index return series have a long-term memory characteristic in the daily, weekly and monthly dimensions; the fractal characteristic of the pure value style of the asset is more significant than that of the pure growth style. Second, the 266 open-end funds are heterogeneous with respect to investment style drift; the serious investment style of the open-end fund was associated with about one third of these funds. Third, the foreign stock index lasted for a long time. HSI 000001, 399001 and 000300 contribute about half of all the variables to DIIS; they are the main factors in investment style shift. Further, the shock effect of international stock price volatility to DIIS exhibited a long-term time-lag effect; while, the domestic series has stronger shock effect on fluctuation range of DIIS.","[Yin, Kedong; Li, Xuemei] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China,"Li, XM (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",lixuemei@ouc.edu.cn,"Li, Xuemei/HKN-8687-2023; Yin, Kedong/B-9773-2009","Li, Xuemei/0000-0003-4334-2791;","Key Project of the National Social Sciences Program Fund [14ZDB151]; Public Science and Technology Ocean Research Funds [2013418034, 201405029]; Humanities and Social Sciences Program of the Ministry of Education [13JBGP005]; China Postdoctoral Science Fundation [2015M580611]; Qingdao postoctoral application research project funding [251]; Fundamnetal Research Funds for the Central Universities [201613006, 201564031]",Key Project of the National Social Sciences Program Fund; Public Science and Technology Ocean Research Funds; Humanities and Social Sciences Program of the Ministry of Education; China Postdoctoral Science Fundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Qingdao postoctoral application research project funding; Fundamnetal Research Funds for the Central Universities,"This paper is supported by The Key Project of the National Social Sciences Program Fund (Grant No.14ZDB151), Public Science and Technology Ocean Research Funds (Grant Nos. 2013418034, 201405029), and the Humanities and Social Sciences Program of the Ministry of Education (Grant No. 13JBGP005).

It is pointed out that the task of surmounting the personnel deficit on all levels of such business must be included in the enterprise development strategy. The theoretical background of development of market structures within surmounting the deficit of qualified human resources is examined. It is demonstrated that in conditions of the monopsony and monopoly on the labor market the optimal quantity of employees and the optimal wage are different from the point of view of the employer and labor unions. At the same time, labor unions and employers create a bilateral monopoly on the labor market. The results of analyzing the demand for human resources required for maintaining the high level of operating standards for enterprises in high-technology industries are presented. The structures of the deficit of human resources according to qualifications levels, as well as the types of the economic activities in the Russian Federation and Czech Republic (Manufacturing, Research and Development, Education) are demonstrated. On the basis of analyzing the structure of the deficit of human resources, recommendations for eliminating this negative factor, suppressing the high-technology business development, are provided.

Most of these researchers' studies, however, do not separate out the sources of oil price shocks when examining the asymmetric effects. In this article, we address this limitation using a two-stage Markov regime-switching approach. Our results indicate that oil supply and demand shocks have a null or minimal impact on stock returns in a low-volatility regime and a statistically significant impact in a high-volatility regime. We observe that oil demand shocks affect stock returns significantly more than oil supply shocks. A positive aggregate demand shock significantly increases stock returns, whereas a positive oil-specific demand shock markedly decreases stock returns. These results have important implications for policymakers and investors.","[Zhu, Huiming; Su, Xianfang; Ren, Yinghua] Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [You, Wanhai] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Fuzhou University,"Zhu, HM (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhuhuiming@hnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671062, 71521061, 71431008]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 71671062, 71521061 and 71431008].",,43,50,52,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As such, in principle contract farming is a necessary condition for the structural transformation of developing economies to occur. Yet contract farming is far from monolithic, and the institution takes on a variety of forms. In this article, we describe how the institution of contract farming varies in cross-sectional data covering 1,200 households across six regions of Madagascar, half of which are growers in contract farming agreements covering a dozen different crops. In this setting, participation in contract fanning has been associated with increases in income, improvements in food security, and reductions in income variability. Given those presumed effects in this setting of participation in contract farming, we then look at the correlates in our data of participation in contract farming. as well as one's willingness to pay to participate in contract fanning as a grower in an attempt to better target policies aimed at encouraging participation in contract farming.","[Bellemare, Marc F.; Lim, Sunghun] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",mbellema@umn.edu,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022",,National Institute of Food and Agriculture [Min-14-061],National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),Bellemare would like to thank the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for funding this work through grant Min-14-061-Smallholder Participation in Agricultural Value Chains: Evidence from Madagascar.,,85,43,48,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using cross-compliance to achieve environmental goals in a Canadian policy context. While Canadian policy makers have flirted with cross-compliance, with the exception of phosphorus regulations for Quebec hog farms, they have never adopted this approach. The potential for effective cross-compliance depends on producer participation, producer compliance with regulations, environmental performance, and overall welfare implications. This study reviews the application of cross-compliance in the United States and EU with regard to the potential application to Canadian agriculture. Policy options are considered which link current business risk management (BRM) programs to alternative environmental regulations (wildlife habitat preservation, nutrient management plans, and beneficial management practices for nutrient management). In general, individual Canadian agricultural support program do not provide sufficient incentives for farmers to participate in cross compliance. However, if support programs are combined, it is better to link programs that redistribute income, with environmental programs, than to link agriculture programs that already address specific market failures.","[Rude, James] Univ Alberta, Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Weersink, Alfons] Univ Guelph, Food Agr & Resource Econ, Room 222 JD MacLachlan Bldg, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Guelph,"Rude, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",James_rude@ualberta.ca; aweersin@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593",Alberta Land Institute,Alberta Land Institute,The authors wish to thank the Alberta Land Institute for generous funding of the project.,,43,9,9,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The results from the fixed effects regression indicate that although farm production diversity does lead to a higher dietary diversity, the effect diminishes with continued farm diversification. The counterfactual analysis from the endogenous switching regression reveals that mixed crop-livestock farming systems do not necessarily enhance dietary diversity. However, we further find that purchasing food from the markets plays an important role in enhancing the dietary diversity of rural smallholder farmers.","[Parvathi, Priyanka] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Parvathi, P (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",parvathi@ifgb.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,63,13,14,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We investigate this issue by examining the response of barley, canola, and spring wheat yields to a set of climate variables on both dryland and irrigated lands in southern Alberta, Canada, with a panel data set at the county level from 1983 to 2007. Our results suggest that warming and increased precipitation tend to increase dryland crop yields, while increased precipitation in June and July tends to show opposite effects on crop yields on irrigated lands. Based on regional projected climate change scenarios, we find that climate change decreases crop yields for all the three crops under dryland production.

Using a mail survey of 767 Ohio Lake Erie recreational angler respondents and a choice experiment, this study provides the first empirical quantification of the economic impacts of HABs on U.S. recreational anglers. Our results demonstrate a significant and substantial willingness to pay by anglers for reduction in HABs, beyond the benefits associated with conventional water quality measures such as catch rates and water clarity. For instance, we find that anglers are willing to pay $8 to $10 more per trip for one less mile of boating through HABs en route to a fishing site. This finding suggests that explicit measures of HABs need to be collected and considered when valuing water quality in nutrient-rich bodies of water. We evaluate the welfare improvements resulting from several nutrient reduction policies, and find that anglers are willing to pay on average $40 to $60 per trip for a policy that cuts upstream phosphorus loadings by 40%. The majority of welfare gains for anglers result from improving the non-catchable component of the fishing experience, notably water clarity and HAB reduction, as opposed to better chances of angler success.","[Zhang, Wendong] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zhang, Wendong] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Sohngen, Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Zhang, WD (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Zhang, WD (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",wdzhang@iastate.edu,,"Sohngen, Brent/0000-0002-9094-160X",Lake Erie Commission; NOAA/Ohio Sea Grant Program,Lake Erie Commission; NOAA/Ohio Sea Grant Program,"Wendong Zhang is an assistant professor in the Department of Economics and Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University.

This paper examines the role of anchoring bias in self-reports of objective and subjective outcomes under recall. We use a unique panel-survey dataset of smallholder farmers from four countries in Central America collected over a period of three years. We exploit differences between recalled and concurrent responses to quantify the degree of mental anchoring in survey recall data. We assess whether respondents use their reported value for the most recent period as a cognitive heuristic when recalling the value from a previous period, while controlling for the value they reported earlier. The results show strong evidence of sizeable anchoring bias in self-reported retrospective indicators for both objective measures (income, wages, and working hours) and subjective measures (reports of happiness, health, stress, and well-being). We also generally observe a larger bias in response to negative changes for objective indicators and a larger bias in response to positive changes for subjective indicators.","[Godlonton, Susan] Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Godlonton, Susan] Int Food Res Inst IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Hernandez, Manuel A.; Murphy, Mike] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Williams College; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hernandez, MA (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",m.a.hernandez@cgiar.org,,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets.",,55,23,28,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach - The data sets about grain production, arable land and chemical fertilizer use in China were collected from FAO, NBSC, and IFA. Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using life cycle assessments. The policies concerning grain production and the environment were collected from the Ministry of Agriculture, and the State Council of China. Findings - China has produced enough food to feed its growing population, but has neglected the resource-environmental costs of grain production since 1978. Consequently, China's grain production is always accompanied with a high cost of resource and environment sustainability. However, from 2006 to 2015, the growth rate of grain production has surpassed that of chemical fertilizer consumption, resulting in improvement in nutrient use efficiency and decreasing trends of environmental cost for grain production. This could be partially attributed to technology innovations, such as Soil-Testing and Fertilizer-Recommendations (STFR), soil quality and crop management improvement, and so on, and policy supports (policies of STFR, soil quality improvement, and high-yield construction). This indicated that China's grain production is starting to transform from high-input and high-output model to less for more. Originality/value - This study is the first to determine the detailed, historical role of technological innovation and agri-environmental policy on the sustainability of grain production in China. The findings should have significant implications for technology and policy for the transformation of China's agriculture development to sustainable intensification.","[Jiao, Xiao-Qiang] China Agr Univ, Dept Plant Nutr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Gang; Cui, Zhen-Ling; Shen, Jian-Bo; Zhang, Fu-Suo] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Zhang, FS (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangfs@cau.edu.cn,"Zhang, Fusuo/AAV-4517-2021; Shen, Jianbo/Y-3591-2019","Shen, Jianbo/0000-0001-8943-948X",National Basic Research Program [973-2015CB150405],National Basic Research Program(National Basic Research Program of China),This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program (973-2015CB150405).,,76,37,40,15,201,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

But what are the consequences of ENSO shocks for these commodity price dynamics? I consider monthly series of 43 primary commodity prices and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Nino3.4 region from January 1980 to December 2016. The SST anomalies serve as a proxy for ENSO, as persistent positive (negative) SST deviations from their historical mean are associated with El Nino (La Nina) events. I apply a time-varying smooth transition autoregressive modeling framework to account for potentially complex dynamic relationships between SST anomalies and prices. The estimated models reveal more amplified price responses during El Nino events, and at the onset of the ENSO cycle. I find statistically significant linkages between SST anomalies and a subset of agricultural commodity prices, which manifests in a better price forecasting for the commodities produced in the tropics. While I also find some in-sample evidence for prices of selected nonagricultural commodities, for example, timber and metals, the ability of SST anomalies to predict these commodity prices in an out-of-sample setting is lacking. These findings carry important welfare implications, especially for developing economies that have been historically linked to the behavior of primary commodity prices, and offer valuable insights to policy makers working in areas related to economic growth and foreign aid programs, as well as those concerned with issues of farm income and rural poverty.","[Ubilava, David] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Ubilava, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,"Ubilava, David/AAH-3542-2019","Ubilava, David/0000-0002-8993-6766",University of Sydney Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,University of Sydney Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,This research was supported by the University of Sydney Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Research Support Scheme.,,61,24,27,2,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The risk and decision-bias parameters for five models estimated for individual responses are shown to be significantly related to land condition but in ways which suggest behavioural aspects of decision making are critical in understanding land management and stocking rate decisions. Our results show that individual heterogeneity in decision making amongst farming groups is likely to be a significant source of variation in farming intensity and technology adoption decisions. This heterogeneity does not appear to be a reflection of socio-demographic characteristics. Furthermore, decision functions appear to be biased toward selection of simpler representative functions (e.g. Expected Utility) for sample averages. This suggests that experimental findings that Expected Utility is representative for actual decisions may be due to sample averaging rather than reflect actual behaviour.","[Gregg, Daniel] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Rolfe, John] Cent Queensland Univ, Rockhampton, Qld, Australia",University of Waikato; Central Queensland University,"Gregg, D (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.",greggd@waikato.ac.nz,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040; Gregg, Daniel/0000-0002-2308-0790",Fitzroy Basin Association,Fitzroy Basin Association,"The authors acknowledge the assistance of Resource Consulting Services (www.rcsaustralia.com.au) in providing access to their database of respondents, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries for providing contact details for respondents and the Fitzroy Basin Association (www.fba.org.au) for providing funding assistance to carry out this research.",,50,9,9,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The findings are simple and dramatic: a $60 per-child monthly SEBTC benefit reduces very low food security among children by one-third (a 3.0 percentage-point decline from a control group level of 9.1%) and food insecurity among children by one-fifth (an 8.3 percentage-point decline from a control group level of 43.0%). Additional benefits also improve food security for the adults in the household. There is some evidence of larger impacts among those households that were more disadvantaged at baseline. These results suggest that an SEBTC-like program would have substantial impacts on child, adult, and household food security. More broadly, they suggest that a moderate (e.g., $100 per household per month) increase in more general food assistance would also have substantial impacts on food security.","[Klerman, Jacob Alex; Wolf, Anne; Bell, Stephen] Abt Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Briefel, Ronette] Mathemat Policy Research, Cambridge, MA USA",ABT Associates; Mathematica,"Klerman, JA (通讯作者)，Abt Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Jacob_Klerman@abtassoc.com,,,,,,,30,9,9,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Thus, farmers are expected to adopt pro-environmental management practices and novel farm technologies. We show that farmers are more likely to adopt new practices and technologies after seeing them demonstrated, but earlier evidence indicates that demonstration is most effectively undertaken within farmer networks. We use multivariate regression to identify the traits of livestock farmers who are innovative by focusing on adoption of pro-environmental management practices (managing nutrients, soils and pugging) and novel farm technologies (e.g., windmills, computer-based management systems, automatic sensors and specialised grasses), considering both numbers adopted and timing. We find that dairy farmers are more innovative than other livestock farmers and that higher education levels and stronger environmental norms within the family are strongly associated with innovativeness. In addition, we find that innovators and early adopters have larger networks than other farmers. Moreover, the composition of these networks is much more varied than the networks of less innovative farmers. These findings imply that innovative farmers in New Zealand may also act as connectors for the diffusion of new ideas in farming.","[Brown, Philip] Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Roper, Simon] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Canterbury,"Brown, P (通讯作者)，Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand.",brownp@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/B-4948-2016","Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/0000-0003-4310-1103",,,,,43,21,23,2,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Consecutive years of drought at the turn of the century led to a rationing of the province's water supply and has raised concerns about the sustainability of the current water use system. In this paper, we develop a representative farm model for six irrigation districts in the South Saskatchewan River Basin to evaluate water use and improved water application efficiency for a scenario that reduces irrigation water availability by 10%. Irrigation districts with relatively greater area of sugar beets and potatoes, that have the most inelastic water demand, will be most affected by a reduction in water availability with relatively large adjustments in irrigation water applied to all other crops. A reduction in water availability also will lead to changes in the relative returns per hectare for irrigated crops, with producers having economic incentives to increase their areas devoted to canola production while reducing that devoted to wheat and barley production. Further, we find that representative farms can largely circumvent reduced water availability by relatively small increases in the efficiency with which water is applied in the field. The results have important policy implications for both producers and water policy makers in Canada.","[Grant, Jason; Peterson, Everett] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 250 Drillfield Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Klein, K.

The underlying idea behind this debate has much to do with the value of output elasticity of public capital. This article presents a meta-analysis of this elasticity, which was performed by considering almost 2,000 elasticities previously estimated from 145 papers. In addition, for each elasticity, we also take into account some 30 associated features relative to the methodology used for each case or relative to the characteristics of data samples. The obtained results reveal an average short- term elasticity of 0.13 (0.16 in the long term). We also find evidence of the importance of the methodology adopted for the obtained results, as well as the publication bias. Finally, we find a minor reduction in the value of the elasticity as public capital endowments increase. The results obtained highlight the positive and important effect of public investment on productivity. As a results of the value obtained, public investment will be self-financed in the long-term because of generated returns. But, we also find that the effectiveness of public investment has a clear influence of the institutional context.","[Nunez-Serrano, Juan A.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Nunez-Serrano, Juan A.; Velazquez, Francisco J.] Grp Res Innovat Prod & Competitiveness, Madrid, Spain; [Velazquez, Francisco J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Econ 2, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Núñez-Serrano, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain.;Núñez-Serrano, JA (通讯作者)，Grp Res Innovat Prod & Competitiveness, Madrid, Spain.",juanandres.nunnez@uam.es,"Nunez-Serrano, Juan A./L-5678-2013; Velazquez, Francisco J./K-8424-2014","Nunez-Serrano, Juan A./0000-0002-3612-676X; Velazquez, Francisco J./0000-0002-2451-5653",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52051-R]; Comunidad de Madrid [H2015/HUM3417]; European Social Fund,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This research was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Research Project ECO2014-52051-R) and the Comunidad de Madrid (Research Project H2015/HUM3417), co-financed by the European Social Fund.

The empirical analysis applies an aggregate quantity framework to country-level panel data from the Economic Accounts for Agriculture for 23 EU Member States. The results imply that TFP has slightly decreased in the EU over the analysed period; however there are significant differences between the OMS and NMS and across Member States.

We derive the main properties of the model and apply it to all agricultural commodities in the Mexican CPI basket, as well as to the international prices of maize, wheat, swine, poultry, and beef products for three different time periods that implied changes in price regulations and behavior: before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; 1987-1993), post-NAFTA (1994-2005), and commodity supercycle (2006-2014). The proposed model seems to adequately fit the volatility process and, according to heteroscedasticity tests, also outperforms the ARCH(1) and GARCH(1,1) models, some of the most popular approaches used in the literature to analyze price volatility. Our results show that, consistent with anecdotal evidence, price volatility trends increased from the period 1987-1993 to 1994-2005. From 1994-2005 to 2006-2014, trends decreased but the persistence of volatility increased for most products, especially for international commodities. In addition, we identify some agricultural products such as avocado, beans, and chicken that, due to their increasing price volatility trends in the 2006-2014 period, may present a risk for food inflation in the short run.","[Guerrero, Santiago] Natl Directory Environm DINAMA, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Hernandez-del-Valle, Gerardo; Juarez-Torres, Miriam] Mexican Cent Bank BANXICO, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Guerrero, S (通讯作者)，Natl Directory Environm DINAMA, Montevideo, Uruguay.",sguerreroe@gmail.com,,"Hernandez-del-Valle, Gerardo/0000-0001-5199-4517",,,,,20,4,4,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This study develops improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based hybrid approach for the short-term hog price forecasting. Specifically, the EEMD is first used to decompose the original hog price series into several intrinsic-mode functions (IMF) and one residue. The fine-to-coarse reconstruction algorithm is then applied to compose the obtained IMFs and residue into the high-frequency fluctuation, the low-frequency fluctuation, and the trend terms which can highlight new features of the hog price fluctuations. Afterwards, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is employed to model the low-frequency fluctuation, while the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the polynomial function are used to fit the high-frequency fluctuation and trend term, respectively, in a multistep-ahead fashion. The commonly used iterated prediction strategy is adopted for the implementation of the multistep-ahead forecasting. The monthly hog price series from January 2000 to May 2015 in China is employed to evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach with the selected counterparts. The numerical results indicate that the improved EEMD-based hybrid approach is a promising alternative for the short-term hog price forecasting.","[Xiong, Tao; Li, Chongguang] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Bao, Yukun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Bao, YK (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",yukunbao@hust.edu.cn,"Bao, Yukun/P-2812-2015","Bao, Yukun/0000-0001-5418-8799","Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [12ZD048]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71501079, 71571080]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M570648]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662014BQ045, 2662015PY026]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Science [13YJA630002]; Modern Information Management Research Centre at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology [2015AA030]",Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Science; Modern Information Management Research Centre at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"Supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Project No. 12&ZD048), the Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71501079 and 71571080), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Project No. 2015M570648), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Project No. 2662014BQ045 and 2662015PY026), the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Science (Project No. 13YJA630002), and a grant from the Modern Information Management Research Centre at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2015AA030).",,40,14,16,7,58,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Initial CO2 quota allocations are a matter of significant concern. How should we allocate CO2 emissions reduction responsibilities among Chinese provinces, assuming that provinces will not or cannot trade these responsibilities among themselves? In this paper, we allocate CO2 quota from the perspective of cost minimisation. First, we estimate the national CO2 marginal abatement cost (MAC) function and deduce the interprovincial MAC functions. Second, we build an allocation model with nonlinear programming for cost minimisation. Finally, we obtain the allocation results under the emissions reduction target by 2030. The results are as follows. (i) The national MAC was 134.3 Yuan/t (at the constant price of 1978) in 2011, with an overall upward trend from 1990 to 2011. (ii) The interprovincial MACs differ significantly and decline gradually from east to west. Hebei has the largest emissions reduction quota, and Shandong has the largest emissions quota by 2030. (iii) Compared with other criteria of per capita, gross domestic product (GDP), grandfathering and carbon intensity, the proposed approach is the most cost-effective in achieving the reduction target, with cost savings of 37.7, 34.5, 47.9 and 33.87 per cent, respectively.","[Jiang, Minxing; Zhu, Bangzhu] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Xie, Rui] Hunan Univ, Coll Econ & Trade, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Jinan University; IPAG Business School; Universite Paris-VIII; Hunan University,"Zhu, BZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wpzbz@126.com,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; Jiang, Minxing/HLQ-5718-2023; XIE, rui/JXR-6421-2024","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205; Xie, Rui/0000-0001-9300-7145","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473180, 71201010, 71303174]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong [2014A030306031]; Department of Education of Guangdong [[2013]246, [2014]145]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents of Guangdong; Department of Education of Guangdong,"We thank Frank Scrimgeour, as well as anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments that have allowed us to improve the manuscript.

This address introduces this problem and attempts to examine evaluative approaches using Alberta's Growing Forward 1 and 2 environmental stewardship programs. While this attempt has uncovered significant data issues, there is evidence that program managers targeted funds to areas where water quality risks are of concern. The review also questions the requirement that producers eligible for funding must have an Environmental Farm Plan.

In early 2013, RIN prices soared, causing the regulator to propose reducing future mandates. We estimate empirically the effect of three policy shocks that reduced the expected mandates in 2013. We find that the largest of these shocks decreased the value of the fuel industry's 2013 compliance obligation by $ 7 billion. We then study the effects of the shocks on commodity markets and the market value of publicly-traded biofuel firms. Results show that the burden of the mandate reductions fell primarily on advanced biofuel firms and commodity markets of the marginal compliance biofuel. We argue that the policy shocks reduced the incentive to invest in the technologies required to meet the future objectives of the RFS, and discuss alternative policy designs to address the problems that arose in 2013.","[Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lawell, C. -Y.

In this study, we use hedonic regression analysis of farm-level data to examine the contribution of transport infrastructure to the value of farmland traded between 2009 and 2011 through its impact on farm productivity. We show that a one per cent reduction in the cost of transportation between farms and ports leads to a 0.33 per cent increase in land prices, and there is no significant difference between rail and road transportation at the aggregate level. Moreover, the benefits generated by particular types of infrastructure services vary between industries and with farm size, suggesting there are multiple channels through which public infrastructure influences agricultural production. Our findings help to inform future investment decisions in Australia and in other countries by providing new evidence regarding the benefits of existing transport infrastructure.","[Sheng, Yu; Jackson, Thomas; Lawson, Kenton] ABARES, Dept Agr, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Sheng, Yu] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Yu] Australian Bur Agr & Resource Econ & Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Peking University,"Sheng, Y (通讯作者)，ABARES, Dept Agr, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",yu.sheng@agriculture.gov.au,"SHENG, Yu/GXZ-8269-2022; Sheng, Yu/ABC-2411-2020",,,,,,30,10,13,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

There has been a rapid increase in the number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) since the mid 1990s and appetite for deep integration was reflected in the growth of European Union (EU) membership. However, the rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership by the United States and the United Kingdom's rejection of the EU common market are symptomatic of a new anti-integration wave. In this address, I discuss the roots of anti-integration sentiments and I review the economics of integration, the measurement and sources of the gains from trade, and trade policy. Canada has much to gain from securing RTAs with large countries like the United States, the EU, and, eventually, with Japan and China. The North American Free Trade Agreement made winners and losers, but long-run gains more than made up for short-run pains.

In order to perform this analysis, we cross the FAS USDA MRL database and the classification of the long-term toxicological effects (LTE) for active substances provided by SAgE pesticide. We then compute a synthetic and polyvalent tool, namely, Health Score, which provides a first overview of the link between LTE and MRL by country.

Consistent with many other studies, technical change has been labor-saving overall, yet technologies adopted have reduced both the absolute and relative numbers of workers not progressing beyond high school. The changing composition of the workforce and technical change have driven an average wedge of 31% between reported wages and wages augmented by our estimates of the state of technology. This gap was greater in the period prior to the mid 1980s, when many of the changes in the education levels of the labor force occurred. Using estimates from the entire 1947-2010 period, the quantity of work provided by the worker hired in 2010 was 31% greater than if no change in labor composition had occurred.","[Lambert, David K.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Lambert, DK (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,,,Kansas State University Experiment Station,Kansas State University Experiment Station,The author also thanks the Kansas State University Experiment Station for its support in conducting this research.,,19,3,4,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

For this purpose, the authors develop and adapt methodology to determine biofuel production effects considering resource prices, the areas of distribution and employment in the EU. Twenty-seven EU member states are selected for empirical research. Over 98% of production is devoted to first-generation biofuels; therefore, second-and third-generation biofuels are not analysed. The empirical study is carried out by analysing the dynamics of quantitative indicators, and we assess changes in direction by setting the values of qualitative indicators. Quantitative and qualitative indicators are calculated using correlation analysis. The results suggest that the fastest growth of ethanol production in the EU took place in Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands. During the analysed period, Germany and France were the largest producers of ethanol and biodiesel. The regression analysis showed a very strong correlation between the number of jobs created and biofuel production. There is also a very strong correlation between the volume of production of biofuels and land used for biofuel feedstock production. The production of biofuel does not significantly affect food and feed crop prices.","[Makutenas, Valdemaras; Miceikiene, Astrida; Sauciunas, Tadas] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Svetlanska, Tatiana; Turcekova, Natalia] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Vytautas Magnus University; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Turcekova, N (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",nturcek@gmail.com,"Bullová, Tatiana/AAL-6756-2020; Turčeková, Natália/AAL-5536-2020","Miceikiene, Astrida/0000-0003-1432-7971; MAKUTENAS, VALDEMARAS/0000-0003-1653-4405",,,,,15,2,2,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This method is particularly suitable for practical application of time series and provides an innovative consistent date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of bubble episodes. Our results show that there are four explosive bubble episodes mostly accompanied by huge price volatilities during 1990-2017, which is largely in line with the asset pricing model (Gurkaynak 2008). The exuberance and collapse of bubble episodes can be explained by imbalance between supply and demand, depreciation of U.S. dollar, financial crisis and speculation. Our findings also provide supporting evidence for the Masters hypothesis that tremendous buying pressure from index investments contributes to substantial bubble episodes. The authorities should accurately identify bubble episode and monitor its evolving process, which is propitious to achieve the effective stabilisation of global food system. Particularly, restrictions on excessive speculative trading should be arranged under extreme market situations in order to forestall the explosion of multiple food bubbles.","[Wang, Xiao-Qing] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Lobont, Oana-Ramona] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Finance, Timisoara, Romania",Ocean University of China; Qingdao University; West University of Timisoara,"Su, CW (通讯作者)，Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",cwsu7137@gmail.com,"Lobont, Oana-Ramona/AAP-8584-2020; Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021; Wang, Xiaoqing/ABD-8602-2021; Lobont, Oana Ramona/AHA-3609-2022","Wang, Xiaoqing/0000-0002-6660-8030; Lobont, Oana Ramona/0000-0002-2942-3715",,,,,23,10,10,4,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

This is pursued using monthly spot prices from 1990 to 2015 and nonparametric copulas. The empirical findings suggest that: (i) The price interrelationships are stronger among the Arabica beans than between the individual Arabica and the Robusta beans; also, price co-movement is higher (lower) where the quality difference is smaller (larger). (ii) There is symmetric price co-movement under positive and negative price shocks; that means, shocks of the same absolute magnitude but of different sign are transmitted from one coffee market to another with the same intensity. The transmission of shocks, however, of the same sign but of different magnitude is asymmetric; in particular, larger (in absolute value) price shocks are transmitted with higher intensity compared with smaller ones.","[Fousekis, Panos; Grigoriadis, Vasilis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Fousekis, P (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",fousekis@econ.auth.gr,"Grigoriadis, Vasilis/JMR-1247-2023",,,,,,45,15,15,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Has Fairtrade contributed to capacity-building among the farmers? To answer these questions, household data of 256 coffee farmers from a tribal coffee-producing community in southern India was collected in 2010. Using the propensity score matching technique, the empirical findings show that Fairtrade certification has a positive impact on farmers' income. However, the incidence of poverty in the community is very high, with 84% of the certified farmers being extremely poor. Some improvement in the livelihoods of certified farmers has occurred from higher and assured farm gate prices, regular collection of coffee from the village centers that reduces travel costs, and from the social Fairtrade premium. But while the benefits are modest and the process is slow, challenges remain in terms of improving the effectiveness and management of the cooperative system, as well as raising the awareness of farmers about Fairtrade certification. There is a need to strengthen the positive impacts created by Fairtrade certification by collaboration between the cooperative and local government to enhance the technical, financial and human capacities of the coffee cooperative members.","[Jena, Pradyot Ranjan] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Sch Management, Mangalore, India; [Jena, Pradyot Ranjan; Grote, Ulrike] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Hannover, Germany",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka; Leibniz University Hannover,"Jena, PR (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Sch Management, Mangalore, India.",jpradyot@gmail.com,"Jena, Dr. Pradyot Ranjan/AAK-2995-2020","Jena, Dr. Pradyot Ranjan/0000-0002-0674-3441; Grote, Ulrike/0000-0002-9073-6294",,,,,47,31,33,1,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Results from a choice experiment are found to depend on when the experiment was conducted and on the market prices prevailing at the time of the survey.

This development took place following what has been dubbed the financialization of commodity markets. We first document changes since 1995 in the relative importance of financial institutions' activity in agricultural futures markets. We then use a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model to ascertain the role of that activity in explaining correlations between weekly grain, livestock, and equity returns from 1995-2015. We provide robust evidence that, accounting for shocks that are idiosyncratic to agricultural markets, world business cycle shocks have a substantial and long-lasting impact on the latter's co-movements with financial markets. In contrast, changes in the intensity of financial speculation have an impact on cross-market return linkages that is shorter-lived and not statistically significant in all model specifications.","[Bruno, Valentina G.; Robe, Michel A.] Amer Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Buyuksahin, Bahattin] Bank Canada, Commod, Ottawa, ON, Canada",American University; Bank of Canada,"Robe, MA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mrobe@american.edu,,"Bruno, Valentina/0000-0002-1636-3776",American University,American University,"Valentina G.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper extends an integrated behavioral model to analyze the relationship between off-farm employment and cotton cultivation by taking into account farmers' risk attitudes. A household survey data of 144 Bt cotton farmers in six villages in Linqing County, Shandong Province conducted in 2012 and 2013 is used. A simultaneous equations model is established and further estimated by using three-stage least squares method. Findings - Although the introduction of Bt cotton has promoted the increase in cotton acreage in China from 1999 to 2007, the planting area of cotton has been decreasing since 2007. The results show the significant correlations among risk attitude, off-farm employment, and cotton cultivation. The planting area of cotton is positively correlated with farmers' willingness to take risk but negatively associated with off-farm employment of family members. The findings imply that the rapid emergence of off-farm labor markets is a major reason for the reduction of cotton acreage in Shandong Province. In the context of the more opportunities of off-farm employment in China, cotton acreage is expected to decrease further. Originality/value - The findings provide a reasonable explanation for the reduction of cotton cultivation in Shandong. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of the relationships among individual risk attitude, off-farm employment, and agricultural behavior, thereby adding to the literature about the application of the integrated behavioral model.","[Min, Shi] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Min, S (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",min.ccap@pku.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673008]; Ministry of Agriculture [2016ZX08015-001],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Agriculture(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi),"The author would like to thank Professor Waibel for his permission to use the household survey data of Bt cotton farmers collected in 2012 and 2013, and his valuable comments.

When firms could not pay according to worker's health preventative effort levels due to asymmetric information, they provide an incentive contract to cope with the moral hazard problem. We test the existence of ex ante moral hazard in the U.S. hog farms. Using a national employee survey data in 1995 and in 2000, we find that even though employers provide protective devices to reduce the negative effects of poor environmental conditions on employees' respiratory health, many employees do not wear the devices, which is consistent with the moral hazard behaviours. The probability of using a protective device is 10 per cent lower in the farms with an agency problem than in family farms without an agency problem, even after we control for medical insurance provision types. Reducing pollutants, providing protective devices and instilling the importance of using masks help to alleviate moral hazard incidences.","[Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xundong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yulong] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA",Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics; Iowa State University,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuli.isu@gmail.com,"Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020","Yu, Li/0000-0003-0067-6548",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403303]; Innovation Research Program and Youth Talent Plan in Central University of Finance and Economics [QYP1604],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Research Program and Youth Talent Plan in Central University of Finance and Economics,"Many thanks go to seminar participants at Peking University, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics and Beijing Normal University.

Processed food trade between Canada and the EU is one of the fastest growing markets, in spite of large trade restrictions due to high tariffs and egregious nontariff barriers (NTB). The processed food sector is characterized by firms which differ in size, productivity, produce differentiated products, and engage in monopolistic competition. We implement a four-region (Canada, the EU, the United States, and the Rest of the World) model of the processed food industry, incorporating these firm characteristics to study the effects of CETA. The results show Canadian and EU bilateral trade flows expand, the number of exporting firms rises, and net welfare in both these countries increases. Though CETA does not liberalize NTBs, we examine the impacts of a 40% cut in NTBs to highlight the benefits that would have accrued had CETA also covered NTBs. Under this scenario, the trade flows would have expanded significantly, and, more importantly, Canadian and EU welfare would have risen by 11.8- and 39.4-fold, respectively. Since CETA excludes the United States, the U.S. processed food industry loses due to greater competition in Canadian and the EU markets, and the net U.S. welfare declines.","[Devadoss, Stephen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Luckstead, Jeff] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Luckstead, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",stephen.devadoss@ttu.edu; jluckste@uark.edu,,,Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2016-11898854],Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),"We very much appreciate the valuable comments of the editor Sebastien Pouliot and an anonymous reviewer.

Using county-level employment data and variation in suitable prairie chicken habitat, we apply a difference-in-differences strategy to measure the employment effects of the listing decision.

We analyze panel data from 309 smallholders in Benin covering the 2011 and 2013 harvest seasons. Results suggest that smallholders are driven to sell at harvest time for different reasons, depending on their motivation for storing. In households that report direct consumption as their primary goal for storing maize, liquidity constraints, not storage losses, reduce the amount they store. In contrast, households that store maize with the intention of selling it later in the year appear unaffected by liquidity constraints. Instead, these households store less when they expect to lose more during storage. These results suggest that policies to provide liquidity will be more helpful in motivating storage among consumption-oriented households. Households motivated to store for later sale will benefit from modern storage technologies that mitigate the operational costs associated with storage losses.","[Kadjo, Didier] ONYX, BP 650 Abidjan 17, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob; Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Abdoulaye, Tahirou] IITA, PMB 5320,Oyo Rd, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Baco, Mohamed N.] Univ Parakou, Fac Agron, Lab Soc Environm LaSEn, BP 27, Parakou, Benin",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA); University of Parakou,"Kadjo, D (通讯作者)，ONYX, BP 650 Abidjan 17, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",kadjodid@gmail.com,,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), under the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS 2 PICS 3); Norman E.

Incorporating subjective risk perception and risk preference information, as well as accounting for heterogeneous status quo alternatives improves overall model performance.","[Krah, Kwabena] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL USA; [Petrolia, Daniel R.; Williams, Angelica; Coble, Keith H.; Harri, Ardian] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS 39759 USA; [Rejesus, Roderick M.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Mississippi State University; North Carolina State University,"Petrolia, DR (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS 39759 USA.",d.petrolia@msstate.edu,"Petrolia, Daniel/AAH-6670-2020; Coble, Keith H./A-3090-2008","Petrolia, Daniel/0000-0003-2102-1612; Krah, Kwabena/0000-0003-4248-7075","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture [2013-67010-20376, MIS-033140]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This material is based upon work that is supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture, under award number 2013-67010-20376, and under project MIS-033140 Benefits and Costs of Natural Resources Policies Affecting Ecosystem Services on Public and Private Lands.",,44,9,10,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives' success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk-averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing-country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory.","[Saitone, Tina L.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Malan, Benoit] Univ FHB Abidjan, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",University of California System; University of California Davis; Universite Felix Houphouet-Boigny,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,66,14,15,1,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This paper lays out several perspectives on how information problems and other externalities affect biosecurity incentives. We use the principal-agent framework to examine livestock disease management in the presence of potential moral hazard and adverse selection. Moral hazard may apply to biosecurity decisions while adverse selection may apply to disease reporting. The example of compensation policies illustrates the importance of creating appropriate incentives: compensation must be sufficient to ensure early reporting but not so large as to discourage appropriate levels of biosecurity effort. Other cases of externalities are more diffuse than those modelled using principal-agent analysis, placing emphasis on third-party effects and coordination problems. Three examples are provided. One concerns free-riding when facing an endemic disease pool that can be managed by limiting sources and flows. Another regards coordination failure when securing against an exotic disease where farmer efforts complement and communicating actions are important. The last arises from absence of a risk market where an adverse infrastructural support externality could be managed by disease outbreak insurance.","[Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wolf, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",hennessy@iastate.edu; wolfch@msu.edu,"Wolf, Christopher A/G-6418-2013",,USDA NIFA Policy Research Center Grant [11061138/2012-01764]; Michigan AgBioResearch,USDA NIFA Policy Research Center Grant; Michigan AgBioResearch,"Hennessy's contribution was partly supported by USDA NIFA Policy Research Center Grant 11061138/2012-01764.

The literature suggests that market failures prevent households from cash crop adoption but remains inconclusive regarding farmers' motives and the effects of commercialization. This article contributes to the debate by offering an original approach to the analysis of commercialization outcomes and farmers' decisions. It consists of applying a model with essential heterogeneity and a semiparametric estimation technique to analyzing harvest value returns to cash cropping. Using Malawian data, we show considerable heterogeneity in harvest value returns to cash cropping both within and between groups of farmers choosing different crop portfolios. Importantly, the results imply rational choices based on comparative advantage considerations of farming households: farmers self-select into the activity where they expect higher gains and adopt cash crops when facing weaker market barriers.","[Radchenko, Natalia] Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Corral, Paul] World Bank, Poverty & Equ Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Winters, Paul] Int Fund Agr Dev, Via Paolo di Dono 44, I-00142 Rome, RM, Italy",American University; The World Bank,"Radchenko, N (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",nataliar@american.edu,"Radchenko, Natalia/AAC-6450-2019; Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534",National Science Foundation [BCS-1039497],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Computing resources used for this work are provided by the American University High Performance Computing System, which is funded in part by the National Science Foundation (BCS-1039497); see www.american.edu/cas/hpc for information on the system and its uses.",,36,5,5,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

One of the questions still incompletely answered is whether Willingness To Pay (WTP) varies with a gradually increasing number of labels on a food product. In order to answer this question, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 191 student respondents, testing consumer valuations of different labeling strategies. Using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism, WTP for 15 food products was measured. The products were endowed with up to six different sustainability labels, such that each grocery item was available in eight product versions. For perishable, nonperishable, and plant-based products, the results indicate that participants are prone to allocating WTP-premiums to labeled products, more than to unlabeled products. For animal products, however, labels do not influence WTP significantly. Furthermore, the premiums do not vary with an increasing number of labels, irrespective of whether the labels signal substitute or complementary sustainability information. The results are not entirely in line with normative notions of magnitude variation, but rather with the behavioral economic concept of embedding effects.","[Tebbe, Eva; von Blanckenburg, Korbinian] Ostwestfalen Lippe Univ Appl Sci, Liebigstr 87, D-32657 Lemgo, Germany",,"Tebbe, E (通讯作者)，Ostwestfalen Lippe Univ Appl Sci, Liebigstr 87, D-32657 Lemgo, Germany.",eva.tebbe@hs-owl.de,,,,,,,57,13,16,2,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This is especially true from the perspective of developing countries, such as India and Pakistan, where significant portions of the labour force are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. This study analysed the impact of macroeconomic policy (i.e. monetary policy) on employment, food inflation, and agricultural growth by analysing to what extent monetary policy is effective in controlling food price inflation, the effect of contractionary monetary policy on the agricultural sector's employment and productivity, and the extent of monetary policy transmission to money market rates and 10-year interest rates. We did so by applying a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model proposed by Bernanke et al. (2005) to agricultural data from 1995 and 1996 to 2016 for India and Pakistan, respectively. We found that tight monetary policy significantly reduced food inflation and agricultural production while increasing the rural unemployment rate. Short-term and 10-year interest rates increased owing to the contractionary monetary policies pursued by both countries. An inclusive monetary policy whereby policymakers work alongside governments to achieve price stabilisation and reasonable employment rates is recommended.","[Wagan, Zulfiqar Ali; Chen, Zhang; Shah, Muhammad Sanaullah] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Seelro, Hakimzadi] Sindh Agr Univ, Fac Social Sci, Tandojam, Sindh, Pakistan",Hefei University of Technology; Sindh Agricultural University,"Wagan, ZA (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zulfiwagan@yahoo.com,"Wagan, Zulfiqar Ali/O-6359-2019","Wagan, Zulfiqar Ali/0000-0002-7178-6042",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373065],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 71373065.",,46,4,4,5,26,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach Using two sets of panel survey data, the China National Rural Survey conducted in 2000 and 2008, and the China Rural Development Survey conducted in 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2016, this study offers a re-visit of China's off-farm employment to give us the latest information about its evolution and whether rural labor markets have developed in a way that will allow them to facilitate the transformation of China's economy more effectively. The evolution of off-farm employment is further examined through decomposition of types, destinations, industries, and population sub-groups as well as the change in the wage rate. Findings The data show the rapid increase in rural labor activities over the whole study period. Most notably, the authors findnd that a rapid rise in off-farm employment has continued even until after 2008 and into the mid-2010s, which is a time when some feared that macroeconomic conditions might keep rural residents on the farm or drive them back to the farm. In the disaggregation of labor market trends, the authors show that labor markets are acting consistently with an economy that is in transition from being dominated by agriculture to being dominated by other forms of production and with a population that is consistently becoming more urban. Originality/value The authors believe that the results will contribute positively to the exploration of answers to the question whether or not rural labor markets have developed in a way that will allow them to facilitate the transformation of China's economy more effectively over the last four decades.","[Zhang, Linxiu; Dong, Yongqing; Bai, Yunli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Yongqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Peking University","Liu, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Dong, Yongqing/GXM-7365-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Dong, Yongqing/0000-0002-3788-1978;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473240, 71333012]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 71333012 and 71473240).,,78,57,61,6,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In recent years, numerous methodologies with various strengths have been proposed for modeling price volatility in financial markets. We propose using a mixture of normals with unique GARCH processes in each component for modeling agricultural commodity prices. While a normal mixture model is quite flexible and allows for time varying skewness and kurtosis, its biggest strength is that each component can be viewed as a different market regime and thus estimated parameters are more readily interpreted. We apply the proposed model to ten different agricultural commodity weekly cash prices. Both in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasting tests confirm that the two-state NM-GARCH approach performs better than the traditional normal GARCH model. A significant and state-dependent inverse leverage effect is detected only for pork in the regime where the price is expected to drop, indicating the volatility in this regime tends to increase more following a realized price rise than a realized price drop.","[Li, Na] Univ Toronto, Dept Nutr Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ker, Alan] Univ Guelph, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Sam, Abdoul G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Aradhyula, Satheesh] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Toronto; University of Guelph; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Arizona,"Ker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON, Canada.",aker@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,52,17,18,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In a mixed model of horizontal differentiation by genetic traits and vertical differentiation by productivity, we derive the empirically testable lower bounds to R&D concentration when R&D investments and market entry are jointly determined. When R&D investments translate into higher product quality, industries are said to be characterized by endogenous fixed costs such that the lower bound to R&D concentration increases with market size, but is less than the lower bound to market concentration based on sales. Using data on field trial applications of GM corn seed, we estimate the lower bound to R&D concentration, and find evidence of endogenous fixed costs with R&D concentration that is significantly greater than perfectly competitive levels. These endogenous fixed costs imply that concentration in the agricultural biotechnology industry is occurring due to the nature of R&D investment in product quality and not through anticompetitive practices. Adjusting for past merger and acquisition activity significantly raises the lower bound for infinitely-sized markets, but has no impact upon current market sizes, implying the industry may still undergo additional consolidation.","[Anderson, Benjamin C.] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Sheldon, Ian M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Agr Mkt Trade & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Colgate University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Anderson, BC (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",bcanderson@colgate.edu,,,"Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2008-35400-18704]","Agricultural Food Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","Benjamin C.

Field survey data from 193 livestock grazing households combined with remotely sensed net primary productivity (NPP) data on the Qinghai-Tibetan-Plateau was used to develop a directional output-orientation distance function. The average efficiency of livestock grazing households is 0.817 when incorporating grazing pressure as an undesirable output, which means that households can achieve 18.3% more output and decrease proportional grazing pressure holding all inputs fixed. The relative shadow price of undesirable grazing pressure to good output grazing revenue is estimated to be between 1.795 and 3.986. According to the Morishima elasticity of substitution between inputs, there is a significant complementary relationship between grassland, labour and capital.","[Huang, Wei] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Gottingen,"Huang, W (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",wei.huang@slu.se,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Huang, Vivian/0000-0002-6652-8268",National Key Programme for Developing Basic Science in China [2012CB955700],National Key Programme for Developing Basic Science in China,"The authors are grateful for helpful comments received from reviewers and previous colleges in department of agricultural economics and rural development, University of Goettingen.

We compare two pricing mechanisms: a discriminatory-price auction and a uniform-price ascending auction, and four bid selection criteria on the basis of: total bid, bid-per-value ratio, bid-per-area ratio and a mixed criterion where bids are formed on the basis of cost but they are selected based on the bid-per-value ratio. We develop a best-response group-bidding model for a discriminatory-price auction where bidders form optimal group bids for individual wildlife zones. In the uniform-price ascending auction, individual landholders respond to prices, which are successively raised by the auctioneer and whenever all the landholders from a single zone agree to participate (i.e. the first zone is formed), the auction stops. Based on numerical simulations using a bio-economic model of malleefowl conservation, we observe that the discriminatory-price auction is more cost-effective than the uniform-price ascending auction. However, the budgetary cost-effectiveness of a discriminatory-price auction is sensitive to bidder uncertainty about the number of competing bidder groups and the highest cost of establishing a wildlife zone among these groups. In terms of bid selection, the mixed bid selection criterion performs best. We discuss the policy implications of these findings.","[Iftekhar, Md Sayed] Univ Western Australia, CEEP, Sch Agr & Environm, M087, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Western Australia; University of Kiel,"Iftekhar, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, CEEP, Sch Agr & Environm, M087, Crawley, WA, Australia.",mdsayed.iftekhar@uwa.edu.au,"Iftekhar, Sayed/J-5298-2013","Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460; Iftekhar, Md Sayed/0000-0002-2827-2943",Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED); UWA Research Collaboration Award,Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED); UWA Research Collaboration Award,"Funding from Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED) and UWA Research Collaboration Award are gratefully acknowledged.

In particular, transport costs influence the prices that smallholders receive for their produce. We propose a simple way of quantifying this influence. Taking the example of bean producers in Nicaragua, we employ a hedonic price model to estimate the effects of a smallholder's proximity to markets on the prices that he/she receives, while controlling for other factors such as the volume and quality of beans sold. We find that on average each additional minute of travel time reduces farm gate prices by 2.5 cents per quintal. Based on these results, the annual income from bean sales of the average smallholder in our sample would increase by between 24 and 110 USD if travel time to markets were reduced by 25%. Estimates of this nature can make an important contribution to cost-benefit assessments of infrastructure investments.","[Ebata, Ayako] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Velasco Pacheco, Pamela Alejandra] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ, La Paz, Bolivia; [von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Sussex; University of Gottingen,"Ebata, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",a.ebata@ids.ac.uk,,"Ebata, Ayako/0000-0001-8131-2759",German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program [RTG 1666]; German Academic Exchange Services (DAAD),German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Services (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program (RTG 1666) and German Academic Exchange Services (DAAD).

The metric accommodates not only project variety but a detailed breakdown of the sources of research productivity, accounting, for example, for the contributions of failed as well as successful investigations. A mean-absolute-deviation loss functional form permits decomposition of knowledge gain into an outcome probability shift (mean surprise) and outcome variance reduction (statistical precision), allowing productivity to be estimated for each of them separately, then combined into a single knowledge production relationship. Laboratory size is found to moderately boost mean surprise but has no effect on statistical precision, while investigator education greatly improves precision but has no effect on mean surprise. Returns to research scale are decreasing in the size dimension alone but increasing when size and education are taken together, suggesting the importance of measuring human capital at both the quantitative and qualitative margins.","[Qin, Lin] ComScore Inc, Data Sci, Portland, OR USA; [Buccola, Steven T.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Buccola, ST (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",sbuccola@oregonstate.edu,,,"AquaFish Innovation Lab, a U.S. Agency for International Development-supported program","AquaFish Innovation Lab, a U.S. Agency for International Development-supported program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","Lin Qin is a manager of data science at comScore, Inc, Portland, Oregon.

Using price, harvest, and export data this paper analyses how glutinous rice prices in Laos PDR are related to those in its trading partners, Thailand and Vietnam. We find that rice prices in Lao PDR are more likely to rise following a good harvest year than a bad or a normal year. This is consistent with export controls being relaxed after good harvests, leading to an increase in exports early in the season and rising prices later as stocks are depleted. There is thus a case for removal of trade restrictions since they give rise to price spikes while keeping the long-term price of glutinous rice low, and thereby hinder increases in income from agriculture. However, since high rice prices are likely to affect the poor negatively in the short to medium term, a combination of an export tax and cash transfers is recommended during the transition period. Although this is a case study of Lao PDR, the findings may equally apply to other developing countries that export their staple food.","[Durevall, Dick] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Durevall, Dick] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Ctr Globalizat & Dev, Gothenburg, Sweden; [van der Weide, Roy] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg; The World Bank,"Durevall, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Durevall, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Ctr Globalizat & Dev, Gothenburg, Sweden.",dick.durevall@gu.se,,"Durevall, Dick/0000-0002-7363-3197",,,,,54,2,2,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

This study analyzes the internal and contextual factors that influence dairy restructuring in French mountainous areas. Three complementary logit models are used to specify farmer decisions (e.g., dairy production exit, stability, and growth). Original and exhaustive geo-located administrative datasets are combined to create a farm longitudinal dataset and characterize farm-restructuring patterns on a fine geographical scale. Farm size, corporate legal status, and specialization are positively associated with farm growth. Viable diversification strategies through either farm processing or agro-environmental scheme contracting are also highlighted. Farm sustainability is supported by the economic success of the local industry and the propensity to adopt extensive practices. With respect to public policy, dairy policy appears to have the strongest impact. Thus, the liberalization of dairy policy threatens the future of dairy farming, particularly in areas with low milk density and no production under labels. This work calls for a policy that promotes the collective dimension of dairy farm performance. The current rural development policy alone may be insufficient to support farms' long-term sustainability.","[Derville, Marie] Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, ENSFEA, IEP Toulouse, UT1 Capitole,UT2J, Toulouse, France; [Allaire, Gilles; Maigne, Elise; Cahuzac, Eric] INRA, US ODR, Chemin Borde Rouge Auzeville, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; INRAE,"Dervillé, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, ENSFEA, IEP Toulouse, UT1 Capitole,UT2J, Toulouse, France.",marie.derville@educagri.fr,,,,,,,43,7,7,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a two-stage dynamic entry game to model market competition in the pre- and post-WMS stages, and test the theoretical model using the method of simulated moments and milk scanner data from Dallas/Fort Worth supermarkets. Findings - The empirical findings show that the entry of WMSs accounts for an average of about 16.29-25.69 percent decline in milk profit margins of nearby, or incumbent, supermarkets. Economies of scale and chain synergies are found to be five times more significant for WMSs than for incumbent supermarkets, granting Wal-Mart a significant competitive edge. Originality/value - This paper quantifies the impact of WMS's entry on incumbent supermarkets' profit margins through a structural model of entry. In addition, this paper assesses the effect economies of scale stemming from the ability to provide shopping convenience to consumers as well as chain economies from operating stores near each other.","[Di, Yuan] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Lopez, Rigoberto] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Liu, Xiaoou] Renmin Univ China, Dept Agr Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; University of Connecticut; Renmin University of China,"Liu, XO (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Dept Agr Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiaoou.liu@ruc.edu.cn,,,"USDA/NIFA Special Grant [2010-34178-20766]; National Science Foundation of China [71373268]; NIFA [580836, 2010-34178-20766] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA/NIFA Special Grant; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding for USDA/NIFA Special Grant 2010-34178-20766 via The Charles J.

Various aspects of volatility in the futures prices of renewable resources (palm oil, coffee, soya beans, rice, wheat and corn) and nonrenewable resources (zinc, aluminium, natural gas, gold, crude oil and copper) are studied, exploring whether volatility is greater in the former than in the latter. We use a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to test our main hypothesis that the volatility in futures prices for renewable resources has recently been equal to or greater than the volatility in futures prices for nonrenewable resources. Our key findings suggest that futures prices for some renewable resources have greater variance than those for benchmark crude oil in a simulated GARCH series. We extend our analysis using a nonlinear vector smooth transition autoregressive (VSTAR) model to test for the existence of a shifting-mean tendency in the commodity series that we researched. We show that transition from a stable to a volatile regime is more abrupt for renewable resources.","[Gevorkyan, Arkady] New Sch Social Res, 6 E 16 St, New York, NY 10003 USA",The New School,"Gevorkyan, A (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, 6 E 16 St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",gevoa020@newschool.edu,,,,,,,37,7,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Past ENSO episodes have had severe impacts on the economy of Colombia. We study the influence of ENSO on Colombian coffee production, exports, and price. Our structural econometric specification is consistent with an economic model of the market for Colombian coffee which, in the short run, is characterized by a downward-sloping demand curve and by a vertical supply curve. We show that El Nino (i.e., positive shocks to ENSO) is beneficial for Colombian production and exports and decreases the real price of Colombian coffee. On the contrary, La Nina (i.e., negative shocks to ENSO) depresses Colombian coffee production and exports and increases price. However, the overall impact of ENSO shocks is small. Both in the short run and in the long run, shocks to international demand for Colombian coffee are more relevant than supply-side shocks in Colombia in explaining the dynamics of the price of Colombian coffee. Our results suggest that a given coffee price shock can have beneficial, detrimental, or negligible effects on the Colombian economy, depending on its underlying cause. As a consequence, policy responses to coffee price shocks should be designed by looking at the causes of the shocks.","[Bastianin, Andrea] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Lanza, Alessandro] LUISS Univ, Rome, Italy; [Lanza, Alessandro] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Bologna, Italy; [Manera, Matteo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Manera, Matteo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; Luiss Guido Carli University; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Milano-Bicocca; Fondazione Mattei,"Bastianin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Milan, Italy.",andrea.bastianin@unimi.it,"Bastianin, Andrea/R-2898-2016","Bastianin, Andrea/0000-0003-2487-7846","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research [MIUR, PRIN 2010-2011] [2010S2LHSE-001]; Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Bologna, Italy","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research [MIUR, PRIN 2010-2011](Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Bologna, Italy","We thank the editor Ashok Mishra and four referees for insightful comments.

We use data on 77 Western Cape Province wine grape farms from 2005-2015 to estimate the impacts on employment. Previous post-apartheid labour market reforms increased minimum wages substantially, but re-entry to global markets after sanctions were lifted increased demand and this preserved jobs in the wine sector. However, by 2005 this demand growth had largely ceased. The long-run wage elasticity for permanent employees was found to be -0.4, but for casual workers the figure was -4.7, so the 51% wage increase is likely to decimate casual employment in the future. Thus, the poorest and most vulnerable casual workers lose most in terms of jobs, incomes and secure livelihoods, whereas 80% of full-time staff benefit from the higher minimum wages. Thus, the minimum wage change is likely to increase the gap between privileged permanent staff and casual workers. This result is not surprising in view of the long-standing interdependence between farmers and their permanent workers in wine grape production.","[Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer; Thirtle, Colin; Vink, Nick] Univ Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Thirtle, Colin] Imperial Coll London, London, England",University of Cape Town; Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University; Imperial College London,"Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England.;Piesse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020; Vink, Nick/K-5330-2013","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300; Vink, Nick/0000-0002-5874-0939",,,,,35,1,1,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

In addition, continuously-traded markets appear to have a more difficult time distinguishing between the newsworthiness of government reports. Nevertheless, continuously traded crop markets take nearly the same time to fully absorb these shocks, following a very similar time path.

Some of the sustainability attributes identified through eye-tracking measures as being 'visually ignored' were truly ignored, whereas in none of the tested approaches was price truly ignored. The adequacy of eye tracking as a visual ANA measure might thus depend on the type of attribute. Further, the study unveiled inconsistencies in identifying non-attenders using visual ANA and the coefficient of variation.

We employ a triple-hurdle model to examine the effect of internet and phones on Peruvian smallholder farmers' market participation, marketplace choice, and volume decisions using household-level data from the IV National Agricultural Census of Peru in 2012. Double matching at the district- and household-levels is implemented to address potential selection bias. Results indicate a positive direct effect of internet and phones on farmers' market participation and volume decisions on the national market. Those with ICT access are more likely to sell on the foreign market than those without ICT access. The marginal effects suggest that internet access tends to have larger impacts on volume decisions than phones. In addition to direct effects, we find that internet access has significant and positive spillover effects on market participation and volume decisions in the national market. Without implementing matching procedures, the magnitude of the ICT effect tends to be smaller. Results provide empirical support for policies and social programmes that promote ICT especially internet usage in rural Peru to improve smallholder farmers' marketing performance.","[Fan, Qin] Calif State Univ Fresno, Craig Sch Business, Dept Econ, 5245 N Backer Ave,M-S PB20, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Salas Garcia, Vania B.] Univ San Martin de Porres, Inst Peru, Lima, Peru",California State University System; California State University Fresno; Universidad de San Martin de Porres,"Fan, Q (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Craig Sch Business, Dept Econ, 5245 N Backer Ave,M-S PB20, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",qfan@csufresno.edu,,"Salas Garcia, Vania Bitia/0000-0001-7568-3879",,,,,32,44,46,12,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Using a partial equilibrium model, I consider three different pricing policies: a consumer level tax, a producer level tax, and a producer subsidy. All policies price emissions at $50 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. The producer level tax generates the greatest reduction in emissions at the lowest social cost per unit of emissions abatement. The producer subsidy results in a smaller reduction in emissions at a higher social cost, relative to the producer tax. However, the subsidy provides a substantial increase in producer surplus, which may make it a politically feasible second-best policy. The consumer level tax results in a trivial reduction in emissions, at a social cost that is greater than the price placed on emissions.","[Slade, Peter] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7H0B9, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Slade, P (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7H0B9, Canada.",peter.slade@usask.ca,,,,,,,52,9,9,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Specifically, we test differences in WTP estimates when using flexible parameter mixing distributions (i.e. Legendre polynomials, step functions and splines) and conventional parameter distributions (normal and lognormal). Similar WTP estimates are obtained. However, we observe that WTP estimates are statistically different from the induced value when conventional distributions are assumed, but they are not when more flexible distributions are assumed. This suggests that flexible distributions can provide more reliable WTP estimates.","[Bazzani, Claudia] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Palma, Marco A.] Texas, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 Texas A&M, College Stn, TX USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 217 Agr Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Verona; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Bazzani, C (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",claudia.bazzani@univr.it,,,Tyson Chair Endowment at the University of Arkansas; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A2044459]; Research Council of Norway [233800],Tyson Chair Endowment at the University of Arkansas; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This work was partly supported by the Tyson Chair Endowment at the University of Arkansas and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2014S1A3A2044459) and Research Council of Norway (Grant #233800).

These policies often differ significantly from first-best policy prescriptions. Among the largest renewable energy mandates enacted to date is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates biofuel consumption far beyond what is feasible with current technology and infrastructure. We critically review the methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency to project near- and long-term compliance costs under the RFS, and draw lessons from the RFS experience to date that would improve the program's efficiency. The lessons are meant to inform both future RFS rulemaking and the design of future climate policies. We draw two lessons specific to the RFS. First, incorporate uncertainty into rulemaking; second, implement multi-year rules. Multi-year rulemaking allows for longer periods between major regulatory decisions and sends greater certainty to markets. We also provide two more general recommendations: tie waiver authority to compliance costs or include cost containment provisions, and fund research and development of new technologies directly rather than mandating them. Future technological advancement is uncertain, and mandating new technologies has proven to be largely ineffective to date, particularly in fuel markets.","[Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lade, Gabriel E.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lawell, C-Y Cynthia Lin] Cornell Univ, Environm Energy & Resource Econ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Lade, GE (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Lade, GE (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",gelade@iastate.edu,"Lin Lawell, C.-Y.

Lack of empirical research on this type of ODA makes this study stand out from the sea of qualitative approaches. By analysing the agricultural sectors and the views of aid recipient countries, this paper provides evidence-based explanations for the aid flows between donor and recipient countries. Using disbursement ODA data covering 141 countries over 2002-2012, we devise and estimate a gravity model. Heckman's two-step approach is adopted to address a potential bias arising from the selection of aid recipient countries. The estimated results confirm that agricultural aid is mainly governed by the needs of the recipient countries with regard to factors such as undernourishment and food inadequacy rates, depth of food deficits and political circumstances. As expected, the results indicate that food aid is influenced mostly by humanitarian factors.","[Ji, Seon-u] Korea Rural Econ Inst, Div Food Mkt, Naju, South Korea; [Lim, Song Soo] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Lim, SS (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",songsoo@korea.ac.kr,"Lim, Song Soo/AAQ-7712-2020; Lim, Song Soo/Q-1560-2015","Lim, Song Soo/0000-0002-2894-1879",Korea University Grant,Korea University Grant,This research is supported by a Korea University Grant.,,39,3,3,1,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The main aim of this paper is to present the mechanisms involved in, as well as barriers to and costs preventing the exit of farms from agriculture, including those that make it difficult to transfer production resources which are being released to other companies. This research takes the form of an overview and is based on the output of new institutional economics, and on transaction cost and rent-seeking theories in particular. The most frequent difficulties encountered in the process of exit from farming include low profitability of production and the shortage of capital among potential buyers, while the lack of sellers' financial resources and the necessity of incurring expenses related to preparing and finalising the sale of resources held by them (the actual transaction costs related to closing down farms) are frequently overlooked. The most important barriers preventing the complete liquidation of farms are the inherent transaction costs categorised as expenses, as well as the emotional costs and costs of alternatives, which are difficult to evaluate and estimate. The following notions are particularly helpful in explaining barriers to exit from farming: the concept of transaction costs and rent-seeking theory, which are both a part of the stream of thought of new institutional economics.","[Satola, Lukasz] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Enterprises Econ & Management, Krakow, Poland; [Wojewodzic, Tomasz; Sroka, Wojciech] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow,"Satola, L (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Enterprises Econ & Management, Krakow, Poland.",lsatola@ar.krakow.pl,"Satoła, Łukasz/AHC-1961-2022; Sroka, Wojciech/AAB-9181-2019; Wojewodzic, Tomasz/AGF-7569-2022","Satola, Lukasz/0000-0001-6714-4568; Sroka, Wojciech/0000-0002-4255-3741",,,,,109,15,15,3,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach The authors make use of China Family Panel Studies survey data, take annual income of farmers of RMB2,300 and RMB3,450 as the poverty lines (poverty line 1 and poverty line 2, respectively). Residents below poverty line 1 and poverty line 2 are 2,580 and 2,661, respectively. Probit model is used to estimate the impact of trade liberalization on the poverty probability. Income-deciding equation is used to estimate the impact of trade liberalization on the income level of poor residents in rural areas. Income-deciding equation is also used to examine the transmission mechanism of trade liberalization affecting rural poverty. Findings This study finds that trade liberalization can reduce the poverty probability of rural residents and promote the income growth of poor residents in rural areas. Trade liberalization increases the income of poor residents and reduces poverty through transmission mechanisms such as promoting economic growth and financial expenditure. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study to quantitatively model the impact of trade liberalization on rural poverty reduction in China using residents' survey data.","[Wang, Jun] GuangDong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yong] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Hu, Y (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",huyong@zjgsu.edu.cn,,,"Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790056, 15JJD790042]; Key institute of Humanities and Social Science in Zhejiang (Zhejiang Gongshang University, Applied Economics); Qianjiang Talents Program of Zhejiang province [QJC1602003]; Modern Business Research Center of Zhejiang Gongshang University [16YXYP03]","Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; Key institute of Humanities and Social Science in Zhejiang (Zhejiang Gongshang University, Applied Economics); Qianjiang Talents Program of Zhejiang province; Modern Business Research Center of Zhejiang Gongshang University","This research is supported by the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant Nos 15YJA790056 and 15JJD790042), Key institute of Humanities and Social Science in Zhejiang (Zhejiang Gongshang University, Applied Economics), Modern Business Research Center of Zhejiang Gongshang University (16YXYP03), Qianjiang Talents Program of Zhejiang province (Grant No. QJC1602003).",,31,4,4,4,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This study proposes a mathematical programming model to develop a production planning and harvesting schedule for chicken farmers. The production planning comprises the number of batches of chickens to be raised in each henhouse, the number of chicks to be raised for each batch, what breed of chicken to raise, when to start raising and the duration of the raising period. The harvesting schedule focuses on when to harvest and how many broilers to harvest each time. Our aim was to develop proper production and harvesting schedules that enable chicken farmers to maximise profits over a planning period. The problem is a highly complicated one. We developed a hybrid heuristic approach to address the issue. The computational results have shown that the proposed model can help chicken farmers to deal with the problems of chicken-henhouse assignment, chicken raising and harvesting, and may thus contribute to increasing profits. A case study of a chicken farmer in Yunlin County (Taiwan) was carried out to illustrate the application of the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to explore the influence of parameter variations.","[You, Peng-Sheng] Natl Chia Yi Univ, Dept Business Adm, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Yi-Chih] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Ind Management, Huwei, Yunlin, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; National Formosa University,"Hsieh, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Ind Management, Huwei, Yunlin, Taiwan.",yhsieh@nfu.edu.tw,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Monte Carlo simulation is used to model stochastic prices and production for a representative Alberta cropping operation. Net present value analysis is used to evaluate BRM program participation. Participation is modeled for Growing Forward and Growing Forward 2 versions of AgriInvest, AgriStability, and AgriInsurance. Adoption of select BMPs is also modeled. Results indicate that BRM program participation significantly improves farm financial performance with a corresponding reduction in risk. Much of the benefit from participation comes from subsidization associated with the programs. While changes to BRM programs under Growing Forward 2 result in reduced support, the impact on representative farm performance is small. BRM program participation reinforces incentives to adopt BMPs that already have positive net benefits (e.g., crop rotation BMPs) and increases the magnitude of disincentives (i.e., net costs) associated with adoption of land use BMPs such as wetland restoration or buffer strips. The results from this analysis raise questions related to both risk management and agri-environmental policy in terms of policy effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility.","[Jeffrey, Scott R.; Unterschultz, James R.] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Trautman, Dawn E.] Univ Alberta, Livestock Gentec AFNS, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Jeffrey, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",scott.jeffrey@ualberta.ca; det@ualberta.ca,"Jeffrey, Scott/B-4222-2013","Jeffrey, Scott/0000-0003-1759-790X",Alberta Land Institute,Alberta Land Institute,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Alberta Land Institute for this project.

This impact is measured through alternative metrics of the short-term changes of the output vector. The heterogeneity of the response to the reform is assessed by estimating both average and quantile TE. As this heterogeneous response may depend on the different farm-level CAP support, a multivalued treatment approach is adopted and applied to treated units (i.e., supported farms). This approach is applied to a balanced panel of Italian FADN farms observed over years 2003-2007. Results show that the 2005 reform of the first pillar of the CAP actually had an impact in (re)orienting short-term farm production choices but this response is largely heterogeneous and concentrated in the lower levels of support.","[Esposti, Roberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Esposti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",r.esposti@univpm.it,,"ESPOSTI, Roberto/0000-0002-1656-0331",,,,,29,14,14,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this article we examine the intertemporal welfare impact of the timing of a farmer's entry into the export pineapple market in southern Ghana. We examine whether farmers who never cultivated pineapple are better or worse off than farmers who decided to adopt pineapple earlier or later relative to their peers and experienced a significant adverse market shock several years prior to our endline survey. We use a two-stage least squares model to estimate the causal effect of duration of pineapple farming on farmer welfare. Consistent with economic theory, we find that earlier adoption of the new crop brings greater welfare gains than does later uptake. But we find that the gains to later uptake of pineapple-just before the market shock-are small in magnitude, just 0.1 standard deviations of a comprehensive asset index, indicating that the gains to adoption may be precarious and depend on the context, in particular on the severity of prospective market shocks.","[Harou, Aurelie P.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21,111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Walker, Thomas F.] World Bank, Social Protect & Labor Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 301G Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, David R Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, 301G Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",McGill University; The World Bank; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Harou, AP (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21,111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",aurelieharou@gmail.com,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721","International Growth Centre, LSE [RA-2009-06-010]; National Science Foundation [SES-0851586]; USAID's AMA CRSP Program [P686140]","International Growth Centre, LSE; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USAID's AMA CRSP Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","We thank Robert Osei and the staff at the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research for their support.

In some nations, nationalistic politicians who threaten to build walls between nations and reject both new and established trade treaties have gained considerable public support by fanning the resentment and anger of those left behind in a globalizing world. Trade and immigration have incorrectly been blamed. Instead, it should be recognized that economic growth has been fueled by technological and institutional changes that have been accelerated by trade and investment. While these changes improve standards of living overall and create new job opportunities, they also displace workers in high cost regions and industries. Perceptions of the fairness of distribution of gains from trade are likely to be improved where public policy effectively assists labor adjustment and mandates socially acceptable employment standards and safety nets. Possible ways to encourage improvements in communication of the benefits of growth that arise from trade and globalization are suggested.","[Veeman, Michele] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Veeman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",michele.veeman@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,61,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Using time and spatial variations, we find evidence that expansion of cotton farming has led to an increase in enrollment and to a reduction of participation in child labor for girls. There are, however, no detectable effects on boys. In theory, cotton adoption could increase household income, leading to increased demand for schooling and reduced child labor. On the other hand, because children are productive on cotton farms, adoption of cotton could increase the opportunity cost of child time and the demand for child labor. We provide suggestive evidence showing that boys are more productive than girls on cotton farms. Taken together, the results suggest that the income effect from cotton adoption might have been larger than the wage effect for girls, hence the overall positive impacts on school enrollment for girls.","[Kazianga, Harounan; Makamu, Francis] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Kazianga, H; Makamu, F (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",harounan.kazianga@okstate.edu; francis.makamu@okstate.edu,,"Kazianga, Harounan/0000-0001-6780-9945",,,,,44,3,3,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Crop insurance premium rates (PRs) are traditionally determined only by point estimation, and this approach may lead to uncertainty because it is sensitive to the underwriter's assumptions regarding the trend, yield distribution, and other issues such as data scarcity and credibility. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to obtain the interval estimate for the PR, which can provide additional information about the accuracy of the point estimate. Design/methodology/approach - A bootstrap method based on the loss cost ratio ratemaking approach is proposed. Using Monte Carlo experiments, the performance of this method is tested against several popular methods. To measure the efficiency of the confidence interval (CI) estimators, the actual coverage probabilities and the average widths of these intervals are calculated. Findings - The proposed method is shown to be as efficient as the non-parametric kernel method, and has the features of flexibility and robustness, and can provide insight for underwriters regarding uncertainty based on the width of the CI. Originality/value - Comprehensive comparisons are conducted to show the advantage and the efficiency of the proposed method. In addition, a significant empirical example is given to show how to use the CIs to support ratemaking.","[Xiao, Yugu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Ctr Appl Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ke] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Porth, Lysa] Univ Manitoba, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies, Winnipeg, MB, Canada","Renmin University of China; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Agriculture Information Institute, CAAS; University of Manitoba","Wang, K (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangkeable@gmail.com,"wang, ke/AAG-2114-2019","wang, ke/0000-0001-5875-0013",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [12XNJ017],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,Funding for this study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (No. 12XNJ017).,,27,1,1,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses data drawn from the production trials of insect-resistant GM maize and expert interviews to determine the impacts of commercializing GM maize at farm level under three scenarios with varying severity of insect pest attacks in maize production. Economic impacts are simulated using a modified Global Trade Analysis Project model. Findings - In farm terms, insect-resistant GM maize increases crop yield and reduces both pesticide and labor inputs. In national terms, China can increase its GDP by USD8.6 billion and maize self-sufficiency by about 2 percent given normal insect pest attacks if China commercializes GM maize. Additional beneficiaries include consumers and the livestock industry. Non-maize crops can also benefit from land saving through GM maize commercialization. Chemical is a sector with the decrease in its output because demand for pesticides will fall. Originality/value - Although China has announced a roadmap for commercializing GM crops for use as feed and in processing after nearly two decades of producing GM cotton, no clear timetable for producing GM maize as feed has been established due to several concerns, including the potential for economic gains from GM maize. This study is the first to assess the economic impacts of commercializing China's GM maize. The findings should have significant policy implications for the development and commercialization of GM crops in general and GM maize in particular.","[Xie, Wei; Ali, Tariq; Cui, Qi; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"Ali, Tariq/ABL-6132-2022","Cui, Qi/0000-0002-3704-8257; Ali, Tariq/0000-0001-6083-6959","National GM Variety Development Special Program [2016ZX08015-001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333013, 71503243]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015004]; Tsinghua University [CIRS2016-03]",National GM Variety Development Special Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Tsinghua University,"This research was supported by grants from the National GM Variety Development Special Program (2016ZX08015-001), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333013 and 71503243), Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y02015004), and Tsinghua University (CIRS2016-03).",,29,25,30,3,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

These varieties were approved for commercial release in North America in 2010 and were planted in spring 2011. China imposed an embargo on corn imports from North America beginning on November 20, 2013, because of its zero-tolerance policy with respect to unapproved genetic traits in imported crops. The embargo was not lifted until December 14, 2014. The embargo led to increased availability of North American corn and a reduction in the price of corn realized by Canadian producers. The relative price of a substitute method was applied to weekly data on Ontario corn prices and Saskatchewan feed barley prices. The Chinese embargo against MIR162 corn caused the corn price received by Canadian farmers to drop by an estimated 1.24% or 5.32 cents/bushel. But for the Chinese embargo against MIR162 corn, Canadian corn producers would have realized an estimated additional $29.7 million in revenue in 2013/2014.","[Schmitz, Troy G.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, SantanHall,Suite 235K,7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",Arizona State University,"Schmitz, TG (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, SantanHall,Suite 235K,7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",troy.schmitz@asu.edu,,,W.

A common approach to evaluate the opportunity cost of providing an environmental good is the exploitation of the distance function's dual relationship to the value function. This implies that the opportunity cost is assumed to be non-negative. This approach also requires a convex technology set. Focusing on crop diversification for a balanced sample of 44 cereal farms in the East of England for the years 2007-2013, this paper develops a novel opportunity cost measure that does not depend on these strong assumptions.

The foundation of this reform comprised the introduction of decoupled payments to farmers, replacing the EU's previous system of supports that were directly linked to production of designated crops and livestock. This paper explores the effect of coupled payments and their subsequent replacement by decoupled support, on the technical efficiency of specialist beef farms in Ireland. Given the high reliance of beef farmers in Ireland on CAP payments, the decoupling of payments has been especially important for the sector. A stochastic production frontier is estimated using a panel dataset comprising detailed accountancy data for Irish beef farms between the years 2000 and 2013. Our results indicate that technical efficiency in the beef farming sector has been consistently poor, with an average efficiency score of only 0.53 during the period analysed. However, we found that direct income received in the form of coupled payments had a positive impact on farm efficiency, and that this positive effect was maintained after their replacement with decoupled income support.","[Cillero, Maria Martinez; Thorne, Fiona] TEAGASC, Agr Econ & Farm Survey Dept, Ashtown, Ireland; [Wallace, Michael] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Breen, James] Univ Coll Dublin, Agri Business & Rural Dev Dept, Dublin, Ireland; [Hennessy, Thia] Univ Coll Cork, Cork Univ Business Sch, Cork, Ireland",Teagasc; Newcastle University - UK; University College Dublin; University College Cork,"Cillero, MM (通讯作者)，TEAGASC, Agr Econ & Farm Survey Dept, Ashtown, Ireland.",maria.m.cillero@gmail.com,,"Martinez Cillero, Maria/0000-0002-0460-4034; Thorne, Fiona/0000-0003-3275-6518; Hennessy, Thia/0000-0002-6137-1249",,,,,50,39,39,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We present and use a newly developed recursive-dynamic multi-commodity model (Agrispace) with CES production functions depicting regional farm clusters derived from the full farm population. Using this model, we simulate impacts of current and alternative subsidy policies on production, prices, input use, income and farm structural change. Mapping cluster results to each farm along with behavioural rules allows estimation of individual profits and farm exits. Our results indicate that, in the short run, the current policy regime seems to support the policy objective of maintaining a variety of farms in all parts of Norway. In the long run, farm structural change is less affected by a policy reform that leaves total support levels unchanged.","[Mittenzwei, Klaus] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Oslo, Norway; [Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; University of Bonn,"Mittenzwei, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Oslo, Norway.",klaus.mittenzwei@nibio.no,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823",Research Council of Norway [233810],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"Wolfgang Britz is in the Institute for Food and Resource Economics University of Bonn, Germany.

The trend annual expansion rate is 2.0 per cent, which is comparable to the rate for India and just one-third of the rate for China, as estimated with the same data and methods. Prior to the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997/98, the rate of urban expansion was faster, and the income elasticity of urban expansion was much higher.

Our estimates suggest that the reform leads to an increase in the capitalisation of decoupled payments by an additional 18cents for each Euro of decoupled payments relative to the pre-reform situation. However, there is an important variation in the reform effects between Member States (MS) particularly between Old Member States (OMS) and New MS (NMS). In NMS, the capitalisation rate slightly reduces from 83% in the pre-reform period to 79% in the post-reform period. Although, the rate is significantly lower in OMS, it doubles (from 21% to 43%) due to the reform. The main sources of the post-reform capitalisation in the European Union (EU) are the pre-reform capitalisation accounting for 69% of the total post-reform capitalisation, followed by the entitlement stock change with 19%, by the internal convergence of payments with 18%, the budget change (including external convergence) with 1%, and the differentiation of payments (redistributive payment) with -7%. Overall, our estimates suggest that on average in the EU, the non-farming landowners' policy gains are 27% of the total decoupled payments in the post-reform period compared to 18% in the pre-reform period.","[Ciaian, Pavel; Kancs, d'Artis; Espinosa, Maria] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; ESPINOSA, MARIA/Z-3794-2019; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","ESPINOSA, MARIA/0000-0002-0766-2539; Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850",,,,,50,41,41,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Agriculture demands land as an input, itself treated as a scarce form of capital. In our model both population and sectoral technological progress are endogenously determined, and key technological parameters of the model are structurally estimated using 1960-2010 data on world GDP, population, cropland and technological progress. Introducing random shocks to the evolution of total factor productivity in agriculture, we show that uncertainty optimally requires more land to be converted into agricultural use as a hedge against production shortages, and that it significantly affects both optimal consumption and population trajectories.","[Lanz, Bruno] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Econ, Geneva, Switzerland; [Swanson, Tim] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ctr Int Environm Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@unine.ch,,,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 [290693 FOODSECURE],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2011 under Grant Agreement Number 290693 FOODSECURE.

We model production technology with a random parameter model that allows us to examine both the direct effect of heterogeneity on production and the indirect effect through the interaction of unobserved heterogeneity with time and input variables. Additionally, we consider intersectoral heterogeneity among types of farming. Results confirm the importance of all these sources of heterogeneity. The second contribution of the article is that, in addition to using conventional statistical methods, we examine the differences between less favored area (LFA) and non-LFA farms using matching techniques. Results indicate that there is only a minor and statistically nonsignificant difference in TE between these groups. However, the difference is highly significant in terms of heterogeneity and technology. In other words, results show that farms in LFAs are not more inefficient but rather use different, production-environment-specific technologies. These findings call attention to the fact that omitting the effect of heterogeneity on production technology leads to biased TE estimates and, in turn, leads to potentially imperfect policy choices.","[Barath, Lajos; Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Titov Trg 4, Koper 6000, Slovenia",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; University of Primorska,"Baráth, L (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",barath.lajos@krtk.mta.hu,"Barath, Lajos/M-6173-2019; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022","Barath, Lajos/0000-0002-7137-2376; Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",OTKA [K120326],OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),Lajos Barath would like to acknowledge the support of the OTKA K120326 program.,,30,22,22,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

One mechanism used to achieve this is to encourage increased energy efficiency. However, improving efficiency may have an opposing effect and cause an increase in energy consumption if the intensity of use changes. This phenomenon is known as the rebound effect. We estimate direct rebound effects for energy use in Australia based on both aggregate residential energy use data and on household energy expenditure data. Our approach implements a new methodology developed by Hunt and Ryan (2014, Catching on the rebound: Why price elasticities are generally inappropriate measures of rebound effects. Surrey Energy Economics Discussion Paper Series SEEDS 148; 2015, Energy Economics 50, 273) that explicitly relates energy service use with energy source demand and directly incorporates measures of efficiency changes. The results indicate that the rebound effect is relatively high for energy use by Australian households. Due to the unique nature of our household data set, we can examine the influence of demographic and housing characteristics. We find that low-income households and households with vulnerable members have the largest rebound effects. The relatively large rebound effects found here suggest that consumers gain from efficiency by improved energy services, and thus, policy targeting energy efficiency is not likely to be successful at reducing energy consumption.","[Peters, Bianca; McWhinnie, Stephanie F.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"McWhinnie, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",stephanie.mcwhinnie@ade-laide.edu.au,,"McWhinnie, Stephanie/0000-0003-0672-0319",,,,,24,6,6,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach The shadow price of agricultural carbon emissions is estimated by applying directional distance function and non-parametric methods. Findings The estimated shadow price of agricultural carbon emissions ranges from 6.78 to 557.83 yuan/ton, and the average value is 62.50 yuan/ton (or $10.18/ton). The MAC value varies in different provinces and years. The regional difference of MAC shows a decreasing trend during the investigation period. Cropping pattern shows a significant negative impact on agricultural MAC. A 1 percent decrease of rice proportion leads to a 0.31 percent increase in MAC value. This implies that the higher the proportion of rice is, the lower the economic cost to reduce agricultural carbon emissions would be. Practical implications It is feasible to draw up appropriate mechanisms for the allocation of emission reduction responsibilities according to conditions in various regions, with emphasis on the local cropping patterns. There is a trade-off between reducing carbon emission and increasing crop yields. Originality/value This study calculates agricultural MAC by using the shadow price approach, taking agricultural carbon emissions as undesired environmental output. The study also provides a reference emission right price and provides guidance to make use of cropping structure adjustment and optimization for exploring the emission reduction strategy.","[Wu, Xianrong] Wuhan Inst Technol, Law & Business Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xianrong] Huazhong Agr Univ, Hubei Rural Dev Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junbiao; You, Liangzhi] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junbiao] Huazhong Agr Univ, Hubei Rural Dev Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [You, Liangzhi] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Wuhan Institute of Technology; Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Zhang, JB (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JB (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Hubei Rural Dev Res Ctr, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhangjb513@126.com,"WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023","You, Liangzhi/0000-0001-7930-8814","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333006, 41371520]; Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research of Ministry of Education [15JZD014]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research of Ministry of Education,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program Nos 71333006 and 41371520) and Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research of Ministry of Education (Program No. 15JZD014).,,36,22,25,8,111,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach Hong's information spill-over test and the DP Granger causality test are applied to investigate the relationship between the two markets. Moreover, a rolling window is introduced into the above two tests to capture time-varying characteristics of the influence of WTI crude oil returns. Findings The empirical results indicate that, first, there exists significant bidirectional linear causality between WTI crude oil returns and China's traditional energy sectoral stock returns, but the nonlinear causality appears weaker. Second, the influence of WTI crude oil returns on traditional energy sectoral stock returns has time-varying characteristics and industry heterogeneity both in the linear and nonlinear cases. Finally, the decline of WTI crude oil prices may strengthen its linear influence on the stock returns of traditional energy sectors, while the excessive rise of market values in traditional energy sectors may weaken the linear and nonlinear influence of WTI on them. Originality/value The general nexus between international crude oil market and China's traditional energy stock market is explored both in the linear and nonlinear perspectives. In particular, the dynamic linear and nonlinear influence of WTI crude oil returns on China's traditional energy sectoral stock returns and its industry heterogeneity are analysed in detail.","[Zhang, Yue-Jun] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun] Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yao-Bin] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Hunan University; Fudan University,"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zyjmis@126.com,"zhang, yue/GQP-5565-2022; wu, yao/IQS-3834-2023; Zhang, Yue-Jun/A-8850-2012","Zhang, Yue-Jun/0000-0001-7687-9267; Wu, Yaobin/0000-0001-8686-4632","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273028, 71322103, 71774051]; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals [W02070325]; Changjiang Scholars Program of the Ministry of Education of China [Q2016154]; Hunan Youth Talent Program",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals; Changjiang Scholars Program of the Ministry of Education of China; Hunan Youth Talent Program,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 71273028, 71322103 and 71774051), National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals (No. W02070325), Changjiang Scholars Program of the Ministry of Education of China (No. Q2016154), and Hunan Youth Talent Program.

We use a dataset derived from the World Bank's Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) database to examine the relationships between R&D/innovation activities in food processing firms in transition countries and (i) privatisation, (ii) foreign direct investment, (iii) trade activities, (iv) market competition pressure, and (v) economies of scale. The empirical analysis is implemented through: (i) a double-hurdle model for R&D participation and expenditures, and (ii) a bivariate probit model for product and process innovation. We find that these economic transformations generally promote R&D/innovation activities in the food processing sector. Our results suggest that broadened and deepened economic liberalisation policies would improve the innovation performance of the food processing sector in transition countries, and would enhance competitiveness in domestic and foreign markets. They also indicate that innovation policies may need to be tailored to market and industrial characteristics of different transition regions.","[Ghazalian, Pascal L.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada; [Fakih, Ali] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Beirut, Lebanon",University of Lethbridge; Lebanese American University,"Ghazalian, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada.",pascal.ghazalian@uleth.ca,"Fakih, Ali/AAG-2833-2019","Fakih, Ali/0000-0002-8562-3308; Ghazalian, Pascal/0000-0002-6230-6879",,,,,79,15,17,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Mitigation of surface erosion comprises the construction of shelterbelts, fencing, riparian buffering, and stock reduction. Mitigation of mass-movement erosion, in turn, takes the form of spaced planting of trees to maintain a persistent, healthy, and complete ground cover. In this article, we assess the economic implications to agriculture of the adoption of mitigation alternatives for erosion control in the Waikato District, New Zealand. The Waikato District presents a spatial pattern of erosion that affects profitability of dairy, and sheep and beef enterprises. We use the Universal Soil Loss Equation and the New Zealand Empirical Erosion Model to estimate erosion figures that are then fed into an economic-focused, nonlinear, partial equilibrium mathematical programming model of New Zealand land use. Different scenarios are constructed for surface and mass-movement soil erosion targets ranging from 0% to 50% below baseline levels. We find that achieving surface erosion targets is more expensive than mass-movement targets, and results in different responses in regional-level costs, land use, enterprise net revenue, and adoption of mitigation alternatives.","[Fernandez, Mario Andres; Daigneault, Adam] Landcare Res, Governance & Policy Team, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Fernandez, Mario Andres] Res & Monitoring Unit, Auckland, New Zealand; [Daigneault, Adam] Univ Maine, Coll Nat Sci Forestry & Agr, Orono, ME 04469 USA",Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Fernandez, MA (通讯作者)，Landcare Res, Governance & Policy Team, Hamilton, New Zealand.;Fernandez, MA (通讯作者)，Res & Monitoring Unit, Auckland, New Zealand.",mario.fernandez@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,"Daigneault, Adam/GYU-9342-2022","Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727; Fernandez, Mario/0000-0002-1390-2375",Landcare Research; Waikato Regional Council,Landcare Research; Waikato Regional Council,"Funding for this research was provided by Landcare Research and the Waikato Regional Council.

It is unclear, however, whether contract farming increases other aspects of household welfare. We use data from six regions of Madagascar and a selection-on-observables design in which we control for a household's marginal utility of participating in contract farming, which we elicited via a contingent valuation experiment, to show that participating in contract farming reduces the duration of a household's hungry season by about eight days on average. Moreover, participation in contract farming makes participating households about 18% more likely to see their hungry season end at any time. Further, we find that these effects are more pronounced for households with more children, and for households with more girls.

Since the tax took effect nationwide, there is no conventional control group that can be used as a baseline to estimate how the tax affected prices. Instead, I make use of control commodities, that is, untaxed goods that are not substitutes for the taxed drinks. I analyze data from Mexico's Consumer Price Index program, using the synthetic control method and a time-series intervention analysis. In both cases I employ a placebo inference approach akin to permutation inference. The estimates show that soda prices rose by more than the amount of the tax. There is less evidence that the prices of potential substitutes rose, possibly indicating that consumers did not switch to those products after the tax took effect. Some simple calculations suggest that the soda price increase could lead to a two-to three-pound reduction in mean weight, which amounts to roughly 1%-2% of mean body mass.","[Grogger, Jeffrey] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Urban Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Grogger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Urban Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jgrogger@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,40,63,71,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We examine the relationship between four common air pollutants and income across Canadian provinces and metropolitan areas. Our study improves upon past studies of the relationship in Canada in two ways. First, our use of panel methods and pollution concentration data from individual monitoring stations allows for a much larger sample size than previous Canadian studies. Furthermore, our econometric modeling approach separates and identifies the relative magnitudes of the scale, composition, and technique effects. Our results are as expected for annual average concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide: a positive effect of increases in the scale of the economy was completely offset by improvements in technology and changes in the composition of output. Similar results are found for ground-level ozone when choosing the measure used to assess the Canada-Wide Standard; however, the results when using annual average concentrations of ozone are much different. We attribute this difference to the focus of government policy to reduce short-term, rather than long-term, exposure to ozone.","[McKitrick, Ross] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Wood, Joel] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, 900 McGill Rd, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada",University of Guelph,"McKitrick, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",rmckitri@uoguelph.ca; jwood@tru.ca,,,,,,,30,1,1,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Although several features of NAAIAP were smarter' than other ISPs in the region, some aspects were less smart'. However, the efficacy of the programme, and the relationship between its design and effectiveness, have been little studied. This article uses nationwide survey data to estimate the effects of NAAIAP participation on Kenyan smallholders' cropping patterns, incomes, and poverty status. Unlike most previous studies of ISPs, a range of panel data- and propensity score-based methods are used to estimate the effects of NAAIAP. The article then compares these estimated effects across estimators and to the effects of other ISPs in SSA, and discusses the likely links between differences in programme designs and impacts. The results are robust to the choice of estimator and suggest that, despite substantial crowding out of commercial fertiliser demand, NAAIAP had sizeable impacts on maize production and poverty severity. NAAIAP's success in targeting resource-poor farmers and implementation through vouchers redeemable at private agro-dealer shops likely contributed to its more favorable impacts than those of ISPs in Malawi and Zambia.","[Mason, Nicole M.; Wineman, Ayala; Mather, David] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kirimi, Lilian] Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Nairobi, Kenya",Michigan State University,"Mason, NM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",masonn@msu.edu,,"Mather, David L/0000-0001-5783-8013",USAID/Kenya through Tegemeo Agricultural Policy Research and Analysis II (TAPRA II) Project,USAID/Kenya through Tegemeo Agricultural Policy Research and Analysis II (TAPRA II) Project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from USAID/Kenya through the Tegemeo Agricultural Policy Research and Analysis II (TAPRA II) Project.

Often-made comparisons note that fertilizer use rates in Africa are just 10-20% of those in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Most attempts to explain relatively low-adoption of fertilizer assume yield responses to inorganic fertilization warrant higher application rates and hypothesize that observed use rates are limited by market-based factors. Another explanation may be that application rates are low because African yields are less responsive to inorganic fertilizer than yields in other regions, and less responsive than analysts perceive. Examining the case of Zambia, we evaluate whether yield response to fertilizers could explain adoption and application rates. A model of yield response is constructed and a combination of estimators is employed to mitigate potential biases related to correlation between fertilizer use and unobserved heterogeneity as well as stochastic shocks. Results indicate higher fertilization rates would be marginally profitable or unprofitable in many cases given commercial fertilizer and maize prices. Phosphoric fertilizer is particularly unprofitable on acidic soils, which are common in Zambia and other areas of sub-Saharan Africa. We propose feasible recommendations for diversifying the current government strategy to enhance crop productivity.","[Burke, William J.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Encina Hall,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jayne, Thom.

Design/methodology/approach - Using the unique data sets of risk preference experiments and maize producer surveys pertaining to the maize production areas of China, this paper explores the determinants of farmers' CIPs and scrutinizes the role of risk aversion in farmers' CIP purchase decisions under the expected utility maximization framework. And a non-zero threshold probit model is used for the analysis. Findings - The results show that risk aversion plays an important role in CIP purchase decision-making, not only in the form of its direct effect but also with regard to the interaction term and expected loss. Furthermore, if the insured amount is high enough, then risk aversion will no longer affect insurance purchase. Additionally, purchase experience, CIP environment (village purchase ratio), and contract items (insured amounts) are significant determinates in these decisions. There is no significant evidence to suggest that serious adverse selection exists in the sampling areas. Originality/value - One theoretical model is established which considered not only general variables like farmers' production and household information, but also conditions and terms in the insurance policies. The unique experimental method is used to measure farmers' risk aversion. Both the role of risk aversion and its' interaction terms with others in CIP participation are scrutinized to identify complicated influences under the context of real society.","[Lyu, Kaiyu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Barre, Thomas J.] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, ERUDITE, Marne La Vallee, France","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Development, CAAS; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC)","Lyu, KY (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",kaiyu.lu@gmail.com,"lyu, kaiyu/JWA-2751-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71373264]; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program [ASTIP-IAED-2015-03],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program,"This paper was conducted as part of the Program 'Research on Farmers' Agricultural Insurance Purchasing Behavior and Risk Management under Climate Chang', funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71373264) and The Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP-IAED-2015-03)",,51,18,20,0,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This article analyses the effects of smallholder farmer participation in export vegetable supply chains in Northern Tanzania on both household hired labor demand and off-farm labor supply, using an age-disaggregated approach. In our sample, neither separability nor exogeneity of smallholder farmer participation in export supply chains can be rejected. Hence, we apply lognormal double-hurdle models and find that participation in export supply chains positively affects households' decision to hire labor from all age groups. We also find that it increases the unconditional overall level of hired labor demand, while the age-disaggregated analysis shows that these effects mostly benefit rural youth. However, our sample does not allow us to establish statistically significant evidence of an effect on household off-farm labor supply although the point estimates point to nonnegligible positive effect sizes.","[Benali, Marwan; Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Gottingen, Germany; [Afari-Sefa, Victor] West & Cent Africa Coastal & Humid Reg, World Vegetable Ctr, Cotonou, Benin",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Benali, M (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",marwan.benali@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346",German Research Foundation (DFG) through the GlobalFood Research Training Group (RTG 1666); Foundation fiat panis; World Vegetable Center; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Research Foundation (DFG) through the GlobalFood Research Training Group (RTG 1666); Foundation fiat panis; World Vegetable Center; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The authors are grateful to Steven T.

However, there seems to be an incompatible coexistence between agricultural and mining activities, as both require a large amount of land. Given the extensive agricultural system in Burkina Faso and the expansion of mining since 2007, this study analyzed the effect of industrial mining land use on poverty in the 13 regions of Burkina Faso. The study examined the effect of mining land use intensity on cereal production/yield before exploring its impact on poverty by using several econometric methods and various data from the National Statistics Institute. The results indicate that mining land use intensity had no direct effect on poverty; instead, the effect is indirect. Indeed, mining land use intensity negatively affects cereal yield, and that reinforces the incidence of poverty in mining regions. Moreover, the results show that cereal production increases with cropped land. As cereal yield decreases with industrial mining land use intensity, this suggests that the expansion of mining would contribute to the jeopardizing of the food supply as well as the exacerbation of poverty in mining regions. Therefore, policies are needed to encourage the sustainable management of land and mining revenue redistribution in the mining regions of Burkina Faso.","[Ouoba, Youmanli] Univ Ouaga2, Dept Econ, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso",,"Ouoba, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Ouaga2, Dept Econ, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.",theodore-ouoba@yahoo.fr,,"OUOBA, Youmanli/0000-0001-6460-2746",,,,,40,7,7,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Employing a Bayesian framework and using these spatially explicit data, we estimate and compare non-spatial probit and spatial Durbin probit models to examine the presence of spatial dependence in land rental intentions. Results show that intentions to rent land for bioenergy crop production are spatially dependent. This spatial dependence arises both from the land supply intentions of nearby landowners and from spatial spillover effects of landowner characteristics and attitudes towards environmental amenities and the disamenities of land rental. We show that ignoring spatial dependence in the intentions of neighbouring landowners to participate in land rental markets for bioenergy feedstocks can lead to distortions that underestimate total effects.

The spillovers that are found are unidirectional from input to output markets. Spillovers tended to be stronger when cattle prices are depressed and feed costs are rising.

There is employed both a descriptive analysis of the duration of comparative advantage, and examined the major drivers using discrete-time duration models with proper controls for unobserved heterogeneity. The robustness of the models is tested with alternative estimation procedures and sub-samples. Estimations show that the comparative advantages for most agri-food products survived for a certain number of years, but a high percentage of them have a shorter duration. Larger trade costs decrease the probability of survival in comparative advantages, while the level of economic development, the size of the country, the agri-food export diversification, and being a new EU member state increases it. Implications for the EU-27 member states and agri-food policies are suggested in the conclusion.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Ferto, I (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si,"Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372",European Community (EC) under the 7th Framework Programme (FP) [312029]; EC FP7 Post-Grant Open Access Pilot; [NKFI-115788],European Community (EC) under the 7th Framework Programme (FP); EC FP7 Post-Grant Open Access Pilot;,"This publication was generated as part of the COMPETE Project, Grant Agreement No. 312029 (http://www.compete-project.eu/), with the financial support from the European Community (EC) under the 7th Framework Programme (FP) and received funding from the EC FP7 Post-Grant Open Access Pilot.

Using detailed farm-level data from the Census of Agriculture and supplemental county-level data, this paper seeks to understand whether purchasing crop insurance influences commercial crop farms' decisions to expand. After instrumenting for the endogenous decision to purchase crop insurance, we find that paying higher net premiums had no statistically significant effect on crop farm expansion from 2007 to 2012. We also find that farms expanded more when they were located in counties with more acres enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program.","[Burns, Christopher B.; Prager, Daniel L.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Burns, CB (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",,,"Burns, Christopher/0000-0002-5729-9977",,,,,29,5,7,0,11,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

China's diet has shifted to include more fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy. Not surprisingly, GHG emissions from food consumption have also increased substantially. This analysis links China's food consumption with the emissions of food production industries in China and its trade partners to determine the effects of dietary change on GHGs since 1989. We utilise high-resolution food production and emissions data to perform a logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition to attribute changes in GHG emissions to the scale, supply structure, demand structure and efficiency effects resulting from Chinese dietary changes over a 20-year period. This study finds that while countries supplying food to China contribute little to China's food-related GHGs, demands for meat and dairy play a much larger role, driving up emissions. The overall scale of increased consumption of all food further propels growth in GHG emissions. Results indicate, however, that while food consumption in China more than doubles between 1989 and 2009 improvements in technological efficiency limit the rate of increase.","[Hawkins, Jacob; Ma, Chunbo; Schilizzi, Steven; Zhang, Fan] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, M089, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Ma, Chunbo] Jinan Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Econ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Western Australia; Jinan University,"Hawkins, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, M089, Crawley, WA, Australia.",jacob.hawkins@research.uwa.edu.au,"Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011","Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943; Hawkins, Jacob/0000-0003-3107-6254; Schilizzi, Steven/0000-0002-4063-074X",University of Western Australia; Australian Postgraduate Awards,University of Western Australia; Australian Postgraduate Awards(Australian Government),Funding for this research by the University of Western Australia and the Australian Postgraduate Awards is gratefully acknowledged.,,53,22,24,9,122,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a nine-province village survey and secondary climate data. A Tobit model (or censored regression model) was used to estimate the determinants of supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. Findings Results show that the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation was 89 percent on average in the past three years. The non-linear relationship in the econometric results revealed that the 30-year annual temperature significantly influenced the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. When the temperature rises above the turning point (6.30 degrees C), it shifts from a positive to a negative relationship with the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. The 30-year annual temperature in eight of the nine provinces (i.e. except for Jilin Province) was higher than the turning point. If the temperature increases by 20 degrees C in the future, other factors being constant, the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation will decline by 20 percent. However, if precipitation increases by 10 percent, the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation could improve by 3 percent, while reducing precipitation by 10 percent will lower the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation by 3 percent. Increasing the density of tubewells considerably improves the supply reliability of groundwater irrigation. However, although increasing the density of tubewells may yield enough groundwater for irrigation, this one-sided approach raises sustainability concerns. Research limitations/implications Although increasing the density of tubewells may ensure that enough groundwater is available for irrigation, such a conclusion is one sided, and sustainability concerns should be raised in assessing this method of creating supply reliability.

Human society has never ceased to fight against poverty. China was once the developing country with the largest rural poor population in the world. Remarkable achievements have been made in China's antipoverty program over the past decades, shaping a unique poverty reduction strategy with Chinese characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to first review the history of China's rural reform and antipoverty, and then analyze the related policy systems, mechanism innovations and future challenges in poverty alleviation and development. At last, some specific policy implications were provided. Design/methodology/approach Literature on China's antipoverty history was reviewed and mechanism innovations on targeted poverty alleviation strategy were investigated. Findings Along with the deepening of the rural reform, the poverty alleviation and development in new China have undergone six stages, and experienced a transformation from relief-oriented to development-oriented poverty alleviation. The object of poverty alleviation has gradually targeted with a transformation from poor counties/areas to villages/households, and the effectiveness of poverty alleviation is also gradually improved. However, the increase in the difficulty of antipoverty, fragile ecological environment, rapid population aging and rural decline poses challenges to the construction of a well-off society in an all-round way in China. Specific antipoverty measures were put forward based on the investigation. Finally, the authors emphasize the importance of strengthening the study of poverty geography. Originality/value This study investigates the history of China's antipoverty policy and analyzes the future challenges for implementing targeted poverty alleviation policy. These findings will lay a foundation for the formulation of China's antipoverty policies after 2020, and provide experience for poverty alleviation in other developing countries around the world.","[Liu, Yansui; Guo, Yuanzhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Assessment & Res Targeted Poverty Alleviat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Zhou, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhouyang@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Liu, Yansui/L-7289-2019; LIU, Yansui/T-6954-2019","Liu, Yansui/0000-0001-6636-7313;","Natural Science Foundation of China [41601172, 41471143]; Certificate of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant [2016M591105]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Certificate of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 41601172, 41471143) and the Certificate of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant (Grant No. 2016M591105).

In years when the price floor would have been binding, on average, U.S. producers would have gained $138 million and Mexican producers would have lost $218 million. However, total Mexican welfare would have actually increased by $11.5 million. Furthermore, the average price floor that would have maximized total Mexican welfare over that period is $22.76/cwt. Also, under certain supply and demand elasticity conditions, the average price floor that would have maximized joint U.S. and Mexican producer welfare over that period is $21.91/cwt.

It will be necessary to stop the reduction in the numbers of livestock and to strive for growth in gross farm income, mainly through the processing of agricultural raw materials.","[Szabo, Luboslav; Grznar, Miroslav] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Zelina, Michal] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Informat Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Presov; University of Economics Bratislava,"Szabo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",luboslav.szabo@euba.sk,,,Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA) of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences [1/0316/14],Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA) of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences),Supported by the Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA) of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (Project No. 1/0316/14).,,21,14,14,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The MRE is sometimes referred to as a revenue cap, but the MRE sets a maximum average allowable freight rate over all tonnes of grain moved. There is no a priori cap to the revenue or amount of grain moved. We argue that the MRE permitted railways to set prices to promote more efficient movement. This paper evaluates the consequences of ending the MRE in the context of Canada's evolving grain supply chain and its interaction with railways. Assuming cartel behavior among railways, we find that the removal of the MRE for grain transportation could increase rates by $42 to $73/t, depending on the market power of grain companies. Farmer prices were lowered by basis shifts larger than $73 in 2013-14, but a long-term rate increase of this magnitude could generate regulatory or strategic responses that were not part of our model. In our worst case scenario, farmers lose 90% of their current surplus. Even modest amounts of market power can generate significant farm price reductions.","[Brewin, Derek G.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Schmitz, Troy G.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Polytech Campus,Santan Hall,Suite 235K, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Nolan, James F.; Gray, Richard S.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Room 3D34,51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada",University of Manitoba; Arizona State University; University of Saskatchewan,"Brewin, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",derek.brewin@umanitoba.ca; tschmitz@asu.edu; james.nolan@usask.ca; richard.gray@usask.ca,"Nolan, James F/F-9786-2011; Brewin, Derek/ABB-1374-2020","Nolan, James/0000-0002-1273-8163; Brewin, Derek/0000-0003-4514-5441; Gray, Richard Stanley/0000-0002-2073-3987",Van Vliet Chair at the University of Saskatchewan,Van Vliet Chair at the University of Saskatchewan,Funding from the Van Vliet Chair at the University of Saskatchewan supported this research.,,51,5,6,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

J,"Hedley, DD",,,,"Hedley, Douglas D.",,,Governance in Canadian Agriculture,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper discusses three broad topics in the development of agricultural and food policies in Canada over the past 150 years. They provide the historical backdrop for these policies in place today and the contorted path they have followed over the years. In some cases, the causes lie outside of agriculture and food, and outside of Canada while in others, the causes lie entirely within the constitutional framework for the agriculture and food industry. The first issue explores the changes in the federal-provincial-territorial relationship in policy constructs for agriculture. Equally, the internal trade arrangements within Canada are explored from this aspect. Tracing the origins of this issue requires exploration of the history, design, and interpretation of the Canadian constitution. The second issue traces the changing role of government in society and the economy and its impact on agriculture and food policy. These changes are not specific to Canada since several countries and international relationships were based on the evolving role of government in the economy and society and its implications for agriculture policy and institutions. The third topic discusses the role that trade and trade agreements have made in Canada's approach to agricultural and food policy development. The emphasis in this topic is on the policies of the past 30 or more years as international agreements began the slow process of liberalizing trade in agriculture and food products. All three of these broad topics are closely linked, providing a mosaic for the understanding of where we have been as a nation and the framework that has emerged today for the agriculture and food industry.","[Hedley, Douglas D.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, 77 Townsend Dr, Nepean, ON K2J 2V3, Canada",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,,douglashedley@rogers.com,,,,,,,19,5,6,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The model integrates the U.S. agricultural sector with the energy sector and it explicitly considers both U.S. ethanol and biodiesel production. The model provides a structural representation of the renewable fuel standard (RFS) policies, and it uses the arbitrage conditions defining the core value of renewable identification number prices to identify the relevant competitive equilibrium conditions. The model is parameterized, based on elasticities and technical coefficients from the literature, to represent observed 2015 data. The model is simulated to analyze alternative scenarios, including repeal of the RFS, projected 2022 RFS mandates, and optimal (second-best) mandates. The results confirm that the current RFS program considerably benefits the agriculture sector, but also leads to overall welfare gains for the United States (mostly via beneficial terms of trade effects). Implementation of projected 2022 mandates, which would require further expansion of biodiesel production, would lead to a considerable welfare loss (relative to 2015 mandate levels). Constrained (second-best) optimal mandates would entail more corn-based ethanol and less biodiesel than currently mandated.","[Moschini, GianCarlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Moschini, GianCarlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lapan, Harvey] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Kim, Hyunseok] Korea Dev Inst, Sejong, South Korea",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Korea Development Institute (KDI),"Moschini, G (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Moschini, G (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",moschini@iastate.edu,,,National Institute of Food and Agriculture [20146702321804],National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"GianCarlo Moschini is a professor and Pioneer Chair in Science and Technology Policy, Department of Economics and Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, and Harvey Lapan is a university professor in the Department of Economics, both at Iowa State University.

In order to avoid the risk of middlemen exiting their region in the future due to hard bargaining, farmers settle for lower prices for their produce. The risks of prolonged drought-induced decline in produce quality and future oversupply of the perishable agricultural commodity also result in lower price outcomes under bargaining. If farmers join a collective that enhances their bargaining power, they tend to be better off when the group is homogeneous.","[Ranjan, Ram] Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Sci & Engn, N Ryde, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Ranjan, R (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Sci & Engn, N Ryde, NSW, Australia.",,,,,,,,26,12,12,1,10,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

CAPRI captures the farm heterogeneity across the EU and it allows to depict the implementation of the greening measures in high detail while integrating the environmental effects and the market feedback of the simulated policy changes. The simulated results reveal that the economic impacts (land use, production, price and income) of CAP greening are rather small, although some farm types, crops (fallow land and pulses) and Member States may be affected more significantly. The CAP greening will lead simultaneously to a small increase in prices and a small decrease in production. Farm income slightly increases because the price effects offset the production decline. Similarly to economic effects, the environmental impacts (GHG emissions, N surplus, ammonia emissions, soil erosion, and biodiversity-friendly farming practices) of CAP greening are small, although some regions may see greater effects than others. In general, the environmental effects at EU level are positive on a per hectare basis, but the increase in UAA can reverse the sign for total impacts. Overall, simulated GHG and ammonia emissions decrease in the EU, while the total N surplus, soil erosion and biodiversity-friendly farming practices indicator slightly increase due to the CAP greening.","[Gocht, Alexander] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Farm Econ, Braunschweig, Germany; [Roeder, Norbert] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Rural Studies, Braunschweig, Germany; [Ciaian, Pavel; Bielza, Maria; Terres, Jean-Michel; Himics, Mihaly; Salputra, Guna] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, VA, Italy",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, VA, Italy.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu,"Roder, Norbert/G-7281-2016; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Roder, Norbert/0000-0002-2491-2624; Himics, Mihaly/0000-0003-3923-9898; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850",European Commission (CAPRI-RD),European Commission (CAPRI-RD),"The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees and editor David Harvey for their helpful comments and suggestions.

In this study, we assess the linkages between consumers' trust (generalized and institutional trust) and their preferences for traditionally raised pork. Data were collected through an online survey including a stated preference experiment in Canada in 2011. Results suggest that both low and high trusting consumers are willing to pay significant premiums for traditionally raised pork over conventional pork. Willingness to pay values are higher for the high trust group as compared to the low trust group. Respondents with higher levels of trust rated traditionally raised pork more positively (in comparison to conventional pork) in terms of taste, freshness, safety, healthiness, and not containing hormones and antibiotics as compared to those respondents who have lower levels of trust. Government certification of traditionally raised pork is important for both consumers with low and high trust. The fact that high trust respondents were more in favor of this production credence attribute suggests that providing it in the market may require additional efforts to convince more of the lower trust individuals that this attribute is worth additional expenditure.","[Muringai, Violet; Goddard, Ellen] Univ Alberta, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Bruce, Heather] Univ Alberta, 3-18E Agr Forestry Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P5, Canada; [Plastow, Graham] Univ Alberta, 1416 Coll Plaza, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada; [Ma, Lifen] Alberta Publ Serv Commiss, 7th Floor Peace Hills Trust Tower,10011-109 St, Edmonton, AB T5J 3S8, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Muringai, V (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",muringai@ualberta.ca; ellen.goddard@ualberta.ca; hbruce@ualberta.ca; plastow@ualberta.ca; lifen@ualberta.ca,"Bruce, Heather/GNP-7840-2022","Plastow, Graham/0000-0002-3774-3110; Goddard, Ellen/0000-0002-5638-0562; Bruce, Heather/0000-0002-8522-813X",Alberta Advanced Education and Technology,Alberta Advanced Education and Technology,"We would like to thank Alberta Advanced Education and Technology for funding this research.

We use duration and stochastic production frontier models on farm household data. We find that the longer the duration of MFG, the shorter the adoption lag and much more so if combined with extension service delivery. Farmer groups function as an important mechanism for improving farm productivity through reduced technical inefficiency in input use. We discuss policy implications under which farmer groups are a useful channel to reduce adoption lag, and the means through which improved farm performance can be achieved.","[Ainembabazi, John Herbert; van Asten, Piet; Ouma, Emily] IITA, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda; [Ainembabazi, John Herbert] AGRA, POB 66773, Nairobi, Kenya; [Vanlauwe, Bernard] IITA, POB 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ouma, Emily] ILRI, POB 24384, Kampala, Uganda; [Blomme, Guy] Biovers Int, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Birachi, Eliud Abucheli] CIAT, POB 1269, Kigali, Rwanda; [Nguezet, Paul Martin Dontsop] IITA, Birava Rd, Bukavu, DEM REP CONGO; [Mignouna, Djana Babatima] IITA, PMB 5320, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Manyong, Victor M.] IITA, POB 34441, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Alliance; Bioversity International; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),"Ainembabazi, JH (通讯作者)，IITA, POB 7878, Kampala, Uganda.;Ainembabazi, JH (通讯作者)，AGRA, POB 66773, Nairobi, Kenya.",HAinembabazi@agra.org,,"vanlauwe, bernard/0000-0001-6016-6027; van Asten, Piet/0000-0003-0584-3552",Belgian Development Cooperation through the Consortium for Improving Agriculture-based Livelihoods in Central Africa (CIALCA) under the Humidtropics and RTB CGIAR Research Programs,Belgian Development Cooperation through the Consortium for Improving Agriculture-based Livelihoods in Central Africa (CIALCA) under the Humidtropics and RTB CGIAR Research Programs,"The authors thank the participants of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) organized by the International Association of Agricultural Economists (Milan Italy, August 8-14, 2015) for their helpful and critical comments on an earlier version of this article.

For example, integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) combines the culturing of fish and extractive aquaculture species at one site to simulate a balanced natural system. In contrast, closed containment aquaculture (CCA) separates farming from the natural marine environment using closed water tanks on land or in water. We explore consumer preferences for salmon produced with IMTA or CCA rather than conventional technology and pose two questions: how aware of IMTA and CCA are salmon consumers on the U.S. West Coast and what are they willing to pay for salmon produced with these methods? Using a discrete choice experiment, we estimate marginal willingness-to-pay of 39.0% and 15.7% for IMTA and CCA, respectively, as a premium added to the price of conventionally farmed Atlantic salmon. Results using latent class analysis show that consumers with a strong preference for wild salmon have high marginal values for farmed salmon produced with IMTA or CCA, but the average consumer from this group would be unlikely to purchase it. Overall, 44.3% and 16.2% of the respondents preferred IMTA or CCA to conventional salmon farming, respectively, and IMTA was preferred to CCA when respondents were asked to choose one.","[Yip, Winnie; Knowler, Duncan; Haider, Wolfgang; Trenholm, Ryan] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Knowler, D (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",wyip116@gmail.com; djk@sfu.ca; rtrenhol@sfu.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of New Brunswick; New Brunswick Research and Productivity Council; Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Fisheries and Oceans Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of New Brunswick; New Brunswick Research and Productivity Council; Cooke Aquaculture Inc.; Kyuquot SEAfoods Ltd.; Marine Harvest Canada Ltd.; Grieg Seafood BC Ltd.; Fisheries and Oceans Canada,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to Dr. Thierry Chopin, Dr. Gregor Reid, Dr. Stephen Cross, and Dr. Roberto Martinez- Espineira for their input.

To unbundle these effects, we specify the cost of risk to explicitly capture four risk componentsmean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Using unique plot-level panel data for Uganda, we estimate and test moments of a flexible production function based on an expanded form of the Johnson S-U family distribution and proceed to simulate the degree of responsiveness of risk premiums and welfare estimates to marginal changes in the share of land under IMV and off-farm income. Scenarios of joint adoption of IMV accompanied with low and high application of inorganic fertilizer, and the effect of off-farm income when there is high and low supply of farm labor are examined. Results show that the use of IMV and off-farm income substantially reduces risk premiums and the individual effect is much higher under low fertilizer application and high supply of farm labor, respectively. Thus implying that self-protection is likely to reduce the propensity for index insurance especially if its design fails to consider the reduction in downside risk.","[Awondo, Sebastain N.] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Alabama Ctr Insurance Informat & Res, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Ramirez, Octavio A.; Colson, Gregory J.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Fonsah, Esendugue G.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Tifton, GA USA; [Kostandini, Genti] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Griffin, GA USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Awondo, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Alabama Ctr Insurance Informat & Res, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",snawondo@culverhouse.ua.edu,,"Colson, Gregory/0000-0002-9863-4399",,,,,29,8,9,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Implications for China as it considers regulatory and institutional change related to private sector incentives to invest in biotechnology are also discussed. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assess the effects of introducing biotechnology and IPRs in the Canadian oilseed sector over time. Data on the rate of return on agricultural research in general are presented and then the focus moves to the impacts for farmers in Canada. New data are gathered to estimate recent gains in the benefit of biotechnology advancements for farmers. Furthermore, the evolution of agricultural research in China is briefly presented, and a discussion follows that considers Canadian evidence and the possible applicability of the impacts to China. Findings - The results support earlier studies identifying gains from agricultural research and show that private sector investments in Canada are now much higher than public sector investments and thus institutional innovations have been a powerful trigger to improve productivity. The gains from biotechnology for farmers are now over CND 1 billion per year in Canada. Research limitations/implications - The research gains measured are for Canada so should be applied to China's situation only as a potential for gains. Practical implications - While more work is needed to identify reasonable institutional incentives to generate private investment in China's biotechnology industry, the potential impact in the Canadian canola sector highlights the importance of continuing the investment in biotechnology, and the need for appropriate policies and regulations to spur private investment. Social implications - Biotechnology greatly improved the welfare of farmers in Canada. Much of the gain the authors find was in improved yields and lower herbicide costs that improved farmer profits. Privatization of breeding was a key step in this transformation. Originality/value - The paper contributes an updated review of Canadian intellectual property institutions related to biotechnology, and an updated measure of gains at the farm level. It also begins the analysis of the applicability of these institutional changes for China.","[Brewin, Derek Gerald] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Malla, Stavroula] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, Lethbridge, AB, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Lethbridge,"Brewin, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",derek_brewin@umanitoba.ca,"Brewin, Derek/ABB-1374-2020","Brewin, Derek/0000-0003-4514-5441",,,,,40,2,2,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The behavioural theory of the firm assumes that these expenditures are subject to changes caused by performance feedback. This paper builds upon these assumptions and extends them by considering the possible effect of national cultures on the nature of these responses to the performance feedback. The research follows 119 firms from nine countries over the period 2001-2015 and analyses their behaviour using generalized linear mixed models. The findings mostly support an effect of national cultures, measured by Hofstede's cultural dimensions, on changes in R&D expenditure and indicate that national culture is one of the factors which needs to be taken into account when utilizing the behavioural theory of the firm.","[Jirasek, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Jirasek, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",mijirasek@mail.muni.cz,"Jirásek, Michal/M-3479-2016","Jirásek, Michal/0000-0002-0407-4045",Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0909/2015],Masaryk University,The paper was supported by the Masaryk University research project (Project No. MUNI/A/0909/2015 - Innovation capability as the basis for measurement of organizational innovation performance).,,17,3,3,0,11,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The dairy industry is a crucial field among the production of food products. On March 31, 2015 the milk quotas were cancelled. The impacts of their cancelation can bring danger for the dairy business but also provide some opportunities. Therefore it is important that businesses are economically powerful and so are able to strengthen their competitive position. This article aims to analyse businesses to identify vulnerable groups of businesses and those groups whose welfare is not essentially jeopardized. Partially, the aim is to assess whether there are significant differences in economic indicators among enterprises of the dairy industry (divided according to their size, ownership and subsidy drawing). At the same time the aim is to find groups of dairy businesses from the set which are similar to each other and which differ from other groups of companies and thus set their position in the Czech market. Over all there were 35 dairy milk businesses analysed in 2013. There were statistically significant differences in some economic indicators among corporations considering drawing grants, size, ownership structure and binding to primary production. According to the cluster analysis the large companies with foreign ownership can be considered as a potential threat and may affect the position and competitiveness of other businesses. The results indicate the endangered position of Czech medium-sized businesses as well as opportunities for stabilizing small businesses which specialize closely.","[Naglova, Zdenka; Boberova, Barbora; Smutka, Lubos] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Horakova, Tereza] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Naglova, Z (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",naglova@pef.czu.cz,"Naglova, Zdenka/W-7256-2019; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Horakova, Tereza/B-7690-2017","Naglova, Zdenka/0000-0001-5871-1735; Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Horakova, Tereza/0000-0001-6231-3668",Faculty of Economics and Management of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20151028],Faculty of Economics and Management of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,Supported by the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (Grant No. 20151028 - Analysis of the Effectiveness of Investment Aid in the Field of Food Industry).,,38,16,16,0,22,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Using meta-regression analysis, the empirical results show that the reported impact of adopting agricultural innovation and technology rises significantly over time, notwithstanding a significant publication bias. Whether studies find significant impacts of adopting agricultural innovation and technology depends on the use of experimental research designs, parametric method, endogenous switching regression and region.

We discuss a set of analytical techniques that are increasingly relevant to our profession as one addresses these issues. Ultimately, we resolve that agricultural and applied economists are uniquely positioned to contribute to the research and outreach agenda on Big Data. We believe there are relevant policy, farm management, supply chain, consumer demand, and sustainability issues where our profession can make major contributions.

Such deductive models provide important tools for generating hypotheses. However, the application of such models in a predictive capacity has been criticised. Simultaneously, empirical studies aimed at quantitative exploration of farmer behaviour have relied heavily on social cognitive models, such as the theory of planned behaviour, without exploration of the epidemiological consequences of variability in behaviour within populations. Advances in other social sciences have revealed systematic biases in human reasoning which cast doubt on the validity of the rational economic model as a generalisation of human decision making. We review the characteristics of infectious disease and disease-control interventions and the potential for bias in implementation decision making at primary producer level. Specific focus is given to the generation of externalities, both positive and negative; the perception of risk, relating to disease incidence, technology adoption and time preference; and finally uncertainty, and its potential to be moderated by trust in information sources. This information is then used to summarise supplemental psychological constructs which taken holistically may strengthen our ability to quantitatively explore human behaviour in this complex decision-making environment.","[Gilbert, William; Rushton, Jonathan] Royal Vet Coll, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of London; University of London Royal Veterinary College,"Gilbert, W (通讯作者)，Royal Vet Coll, Hatfield, Herts, England.",wgilbert@rvc.ac.uk,,"Gilbert, William/0000-0002-7450-7643",Royal Veterinary College,Royal Veterinary College,This work was funded by the Royal Veterinary College as part of a Research Studentship.,,125,20,21,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We extend the former in order to allow for heterogeneity in the long-run technical efficiency of firms. This model is based on potential differences in firm-specific characteristics and in firms' inefficiency persistence. The model is applied to an unbalanced micro-panel of German dairy farms over the period 1999 to 2009. Estimation of long-run technical efficiency and inefficiency persistence is based on an output distance function representation of the production technology and estimated in a Bayesian framework. The results suggest that heterogeneity in long-run technical efficiency of farms is mostly attributed to discrepancies in farm-specific factors rather than differences in farms' inefficiency persistence. Farm size is positively related to long-run technical efficiency while subsidies exert a negative effect on the long-run technical efficiency of farms. Inefficiency persistence is found to be very high, but heterogeneity in this persistence is low.","[Skevas, Ioannis; Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Gottingen, Germany; [Emvalomatis, Grigorios] Univ Dundee, Dept Econ Studies, Dundee, Scotland",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; University of Dundee,"Skevas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",iskevas@gwdg.de,"SKEVAS, IOANNIS/AAB-5138-2019; Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009; Emvalomatis, Grigorios/JWT-0010-2024","SKEVAS, IOANNIS/0000-0003-4595-4396; Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Emvalomatis, Grigorios/0000-0001-8727-5151",,,,,35,31,31,4,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Energy poverty, per se, is one important yet too often neglected dimension of poverty, and one of the biggest challenges in rural China during the 40-year rural reform. Reducing energy poverty is one of the poverty alleviation tasks and the goals of energy transition in the rural areas. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the status of energy poverty in China, discussing the challenges of energy poverty reduction, and then proposing the potential measures. Design/methodology/approach Using various data (including the authors' survey data), this paper analyzes the volume and structure of energy use, and affordability of energy for the rural households, then examines the impacts of energy poverty on health, social and productivity, and finally discusses the infrastructure, cognitive ability, culture, income, etc., that shape the challenges to energy poverty reduction. Findings In addition to raising the household income, it is urgently needed to enforce the collaborations among government departments, and to improve the energy infrastructure according to local conditions, helping the residential environment cognition. Originality/value Energy poverty is almost a too often neglected issue in rural China. Few in existing literature comprehensively investigate this critically important social economic problem. This paper contributes to the profound understanding in energy poverty and the possible approaches to alleviate it.","[He, Ling-Yun] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Ling-Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hou, Bingdong; Liao, Hua] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Bingdong; Liao, Hua] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liao, Hua] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Liao, H (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liao, H (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liao, H (通讯作者)，Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liaohua55@163.com,"HE, Ling-Yun/K-2346-2012; Liao, Hua/C-4931-2012","Liao, Hua/0000-0002-4835-927X; He, Ling-Yun/0000-0003-3565-9422","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573258, 71273261, 71673026, 71642004, 71521002, 71322306]; China's National Key RD Program [2016YFA0602801]; Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China's National Key RD Program; Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation),"The authors acknowledge the supports from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71573258, 71273261, 71673026, 71642004, 71521002, and 71322306), China's National Key R&D Program (2016YFA0602801), Special Fund for Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education and Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation.

The paper present focuses on the relationship between profitability, return on sales (ROS) and wheat yields per hectare in agricultural entities in member states of the European Union (EU), divided into size categories by quantity standard output (SO). Due to the high proportion of subsidies in agriculture, the ROS indicator was rated in two versions: including subsidies and excluding subsidies. The aim of the paper is to confirm or refute the mutual relationship between these indicators, i.e. wheat yields per hectare, return on sales, and the size of the farm. The comparison is performed by means of indicators of descriptive statistics and tests of mathematical statistics. The results of the research show that return on sales drops with the size of the farm, while yields per hectare grow.","[Hyblova, Eva; Skalicky, Roman] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hyblova, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",hyblova@econ.muni.cz,,,[MUNI/A/0823/2016],,"Supported by the project MUNI/A/0823/2016 - Behavioural, Knowledge and Economic Aspects of Trading and Valuation of Financial and Other Assets.",,22,11,12,2,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

In particular, the authors examine three subsidy designs including area-based subsidy, quantity-based subsidy and production-cost-based subsidy. Design/methodology/approach To carry out the analysis, the authors develop a Chinese agricultural sector model (CASM) and an econometric, policy action-farmer response summary model. The CASM is used under a wide variety of subsidy level and basis experiments to generate pseudo data on farmer reactions to subsidies. Then a summary function model was estimated over those pseudo data that quantitatively summarized modeled farmer responses to different grain subsidy schemes. In turn, the summary functions were used to optimize the subsidy level such that it maximized grain production both within and across the area-based, quantity-based and cost-based subsidies. Regional implications were also developed. Findings The authors found that the production-quantity-based subsidy is the most cost-effective in stimulating grain production among the subsidy schemes. The authors also argue that scheme complies with WTO regulations regarding product-specific support. The authors found that the areas where grain production was most affected were the traditional grain-producing regions. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge the authors have not seen a study of the Chinese grain subsidy program context that examined the effects of alternative subsidy schemes, nor one that developed estimates of the optimal subsidy level. In addition, the methodology is unique employing bottom-up, regionally disaggregated, sector modeling coupled with an aggregate pseudo data based summary function approach providing a new, original approach for analyzing agricultural policy design.","[Yi, Fujin] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [McCarl, Bruce] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Yi, FJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fujinyi@njau.edu.cn,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011",,National Science Foundation of China [71673137]; Nanjing Agricultural University [SKCX2015004]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University; Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute; Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center,National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nanjing Agricultural University; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University; Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute; Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71673137), Nanjing Agricultural University (Grant No. SKCX2015004), Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University, Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute, and Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center.

In this article, I compare the levels of technical efficiency achieved on plots operated by households with different levels of gender disparities. Using plot-level data from the 2011-2012 Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey and drawing on indicators derived from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, I estimate a stochastic frontier production function model, which includes women's empowerment in agriculture as an exogenous determinant of technical inefficiency. I find that reduced gender disparities within households (measured in terms of the empowerment gap between spouses) are associated with higher levels of technical efficiency.

We further quantify non-tariff measures (NTM) affecting these trade flows between the EU and the US.

This has triggered vigorous debates on the impacts on trade and development. Standards may simultaneously enhance economic efficiency and redistribute rents, complicating policy analysis and implying that the economics and the politics of standards are often hard to separate. While substantial research has contributed important insights, dynamic aspects of standards have not received much attention. I present a framework to illustrate some dynamic economic and political aspects of standards in closed and open economies. This framework integrates changes over time in preferences, implementation costs, and protectionist pressures as determinants of standards, and suggests explanations for persistent differences in food standards across countries. Hysteresis in standards can persist due to protectionist motives, even if the initial standards were not introduced for protectionist reasons. I use some historical cases to document both the persistence and adjustment of standards over time and with international integration.","[Swinnen, Johan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Econ, Leuven, Belgium; [Swinnen, Johan] LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium; [Swinnen, Johan] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",KU Leuven; Stanford University,"Swinnen, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Econ, Leuven, Belgium.;Swinnen, J (通讯作者)，LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium.;Swinnen, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jo.swinnen@kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978",,,,,78,31,34,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Second, it exploits a rich data set of agricultural commodity prices which includes commodities that are usually overlooked in the literature, and extracts a common factor using the dynamic factor model to understand the extent of comovement of the prices and to gauge the extent to which macroeconomic shocks drive the comovement in a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) framework.

The purpose of this paper is to assess consumers' preferences for tomatoes carrying these different labels. Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this study came from choice experiments (CEs) conducted in Shandong province, China. Based on experiment data, a random parameter logit model was established to analyze consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP). Findings - Consumers' WTP for organic tomatoes was higher than that for hazard-free and green-certified tomatoes. Furthermore, consumers' WTP for the European Union (EU) organic label was higher than that for the Chinese organic label, whereas a non-significant difference existed between the levels of consumers' WTP for hazard-free and green-certified tomatoes. Consumers with different food safety risk perception (FSRP) had large differences in WTP, whereas those with varying environmental awareness (ENAW) had similar levels of WTP. Originality/value - This contribution is the first research which focuses on consumers' WTP for EU organic label, Chinese organic label, green label, or hazard-free label on tomato through CEs in China.

This article develops a simple, empirically relevant multimarket framework of heterogeneous consumers and an imperfectly competitive innovating firm to analyze the profit-maximizing strategies of innovating firms in hunger-stricken areas of the world. The analysis shows that, when the association of the GM technology with malnutrition and hunger reduction in food insecure areas of the world decreases consumer aversion to the GM technology in the rest of the world, the innovating firm can find it economically optimal to reduce its price and increase consumer access to nutritious food in these hunger-stricken areas. When the impact of hunger reduction on consumer attitudes toward the GM technology is relatively strong, the firm will find it optimal to offer its GM technology in the hunger-stricken areas for free as its losses in these areas are more than compensated by its gains in the rest of the world. This result is in contrast with the standard assumption of innovators' desire to exercise the market power conferred by their intellectual property rights and provides some analytical support to the strategic corporate social responsibility (CSR) hypothesis.","[Giannakas, Konstantinos; Yiannaka, Amalia] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, 217 HC Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Giannakas, K (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, 217 HC Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",kgiannakas@unl.edu,,"Giannakas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3628-2869",,,,,33,3,3,1,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

China is facing such a serious problem with its growing dairy market seeing serious food safety scandals. In this article, we examine a new organizational structure recently promoted by Chinese government, dairy complex, and its effects on farmers' behaviors related to safe production and the effectiveness of such behavior on the raw milk safety, using a joint production function under risk theoretical framework. Results show that farmers' production practices such as basic production environment and hygienic condition, disease prevention, and source and use of feed all contribute to the food safety of raw milk. Complex is an important factor contributing to farmers' adoption of such safety production practices, together with the supervision by government, production scale, contracts with processors, and price of raw milk. We, thus, found that dairy complex as an organization structure can influence the safety of raw milk indirectly through its impacts on farmers' production behaviors. Another important finding is that unsafe milk is a result of uncertainty when less strict production practice is used by risk lover producers, and the complexes work well for such farmers by pushing them to take more conservative safety measurements. This innovative production system can be a good measure for developing economies with similar small producer problems.","[Yu, Hailong] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, H.

We use this model to characterize optimal hedging with and without reference price dependence. The model's theoretical predictions are tested with a unique database consisting of every forward contract written with a major grain marketing firm by Iowa corn producers over a five-year period. Our results suggest that a current December futures price higher than a reference price triggers hedging activity. A likely candidate for producers' reference price is a rolling average of the current futures price. We then use trading activity implied by the producers to determine if they benefit from the way they hedge. The evidence is mixed. Finally, we compare the producer forward contract data to the only publicly available data on producer hedging: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Disaggregated Commitment of Traders Report (DCOT) for Short Hedgers. A hedge ratio constructed from the open interest in new futures contracts of the DCOT report is highly correlated with the producer hedge series in the Iowa data, providing evidence that DCOT data represent farmers' hedging behavior reasonably well. This work has important implications for future research that uses the DCOT data, and provides new evidence about producers' hedging behavior that marketing specialists and extension agents can use to enhance their educational efforts related to risk management.","[Jacobs, Keri L.] Iowa State Univ, Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Li, Ziran] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Hayes, Dermot J.] Iowa State Univ, Econ & Finance, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Iowa State University,"Li, ZR (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",lizr@swufe.edu.cn,"Jacobs, Keri L/M-9988-2017",,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project [1010309]; NIFA [913628, 1010309] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),This research was supported in part by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch project 1010309.,,54,3,4,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In order to control for selection bias, we estimate a flexible moment-based production function using an endogenous switching regression treatment effects model. We find that tillage has a complementary impact on productivity and risk exposure. As the intensity of tillage increases, productivity increases and farmers' exposure to risk declines. Our results suggest that smallholder farmers use tillage as an ex-ante risk management strategy. The main policy implication of this study is that the opportunity cost of switching to reduced tillage in wheat production seem rather high unless farmers are supported by appropriate incentive schemes.","[Abro, Zewdu Ayalew] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Jaleta, Moti] CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Teklewold, Hailemariam] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Environm & Climate Res Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Gottingen,"Abro, ZA (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",zabro@uni-goettingen.de,"Abro, Zewdu/AFL-0442-2022; Abro, Zewdu/T-6125-2019","Abro, Zewdu/0000-0002-4116-7945;",Standing Panel for Impact Assessment (SPIA); Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project through Cornell University; Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project through Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),Standing Panel for Impact Assessment (SPIA); Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project through Cornell University; Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat (DRRW) project through Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"Moti Jaleta is in the Socio-Economics Program, CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Crop insurance may change farm investments by reducing risks and providing subsidies. First, actuarially fair insurance reduces risks in crop production and marketing, holding the expected return constant. Second, insurance subsidies encourage farms to purchase crop insurance, which increases the expected return to insured risky crops. Farms also have many self-insurance mechanisms such as crop diversification or working off the farm. We derive conditions under which (1) unsubsidized and actuarially fair crop insurance or (2) insurance premium subsidies lead to more investment in a risky higher return crop. We then examine the role of self-insurance for these conditions. The impact of premium subsidies is decomposed into a direct profit effect and an indirect coverage effect. These effects are explained by substitutions between market insurance and self-insurance and between a risky crop and a safe crop. We discuss each effect as a combination of subsidy and risk effects. Numerical illustrations show that an insurance subsidy has a larger impact on risky crop investments compared to that of an input subsidy when farms are more risk-averse and have high costs of self-insurance. The framework provides a novel way to evaluate subsidized crop insurance programs.","[Yu, Jisang] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Kansas State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Yu, JS (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jisangyu@ksu.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011; Yu, Jisang/JOZ-5167-2023","Yu, Jisang/0000-0003-3936-1877",,,,,37,36,53,15,123,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Recent evidence, however, points to the coexistence of substantial heterogeneity across farm households and the lack of a suitable mix of inputs for farmers to take advantage of input complementarities. We use a random coefficients multivariate probit model to quantify the complementarities between agricultural inputs and alternative forms of unobserved heterogeneity effects in modeling farmers' technology adoption decisions. The empirical analysis reveals that, conditional on various types of unobserved heterogeneity effects, farmers' technology adoption decisions exhibit strong complementarity for some inputs. The analysis also reveals substantial unobserved heterogeneity effects. We show that ignoring these behavioural features (unobserved heterogeneity and input complementarity) has important implications in quantifying the effect of some policy interventions that are meant to facilitate technology adoption. In particular, ignoring these features leads to significant overestimation of the effectiveness of extension services.","[Abay, Kibrom A.] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Berhane, Guush; Taffesse, Alemayehu Seyoum; Abay, Kibrewossen; Koru, Bethelhem] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Copenhagen; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Abay, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",Kibrom.Araya.Abay@econ.ku.dk,,"Berhane, Guush/0000-0002-1947-9483; Abay, Kibrom/0000-0003-1451-2421",,,,,58,22,22,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Unfortunately, projected growth rates have fallen in recent years; this article examines the impact of this slowdown on the poor, particularly the rural poor. It first uses a global model to assess the impacts of lower productivity on key price and income variables. It then uses microsimulation models for almost 300,000 households to assess the impacts on their real incomes. Although poverty rates overall are projected to fall substantially, the poorest countries see the greatest slowdown in poverty reduction, with over 5% of their population projected to remain below the poverty line. In addition, poverty rates will remain alarmingly high in many countries. Overall, 38 million fewer people will leave extreme poverty compared to earlier projections. Farm households are at particular risk in middle-income countries, with over 1.5% more of the farming population remaining trapped in poverty than previously estimated. By 2030, average extreme poverty in rural areas is projected at about 7.5%, rather than 7.1% under the earlier growth projections. Clearly, a strong focus on policies for poverty reduction will be vital for eliminating poverty by 2030.","[Debucquet, David Laborde; Martin, Will] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Martin, W (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",w.martin@cgiar.org,"Martin, William/E-6226-2011","Martin, William/0000-0002-2824-1303",,,,,19,14,14,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this study, we compare WTP estimates from three incentive-aligned value elicitation methods: real choice experiment (RCE), real double-bounded dichotomous contingent valuation (RCVM), and Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction (BDM). We find that participants' aggressiveness in obtaining low prices (i.e., deal-proneness) influences WTP estimates in the BDM auction, but not those elicited from the RCE and RCVM. The participants with higher levels of deal-proneness tend to submit lower bids in the BDM auction. The discrepancies in WTP estimates between different incentive-aligned procedures are narrower for participants with lower levels of deal-proneness. Our results indicate that the bids in BDM auctions may be understated and the auction mechanism may induce the gambling behavior of people who are deal-prone. That is, whether the BDM auction is truly incentive-aligned is again called into question. We also discuss the practical implications for food retailers.","[Shi, Lijia; Xie, Jing; Gao, Zhifeng] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Gao, Zhifeng] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Changchun 130118, Jilin, Peoples R China",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Jilin Agricultural University,"Shi, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",lijiadedanta@gmail.com; zfgao@ufl.edu,"Gao, Zhifeng/AFD-7759-2022","Gao, Zhifeng/0000-0003-2984-8278","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [FLA-FRE-005292]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project FLA-FRE-005292 (PI Dr. Zhifeng Gao, zfgao@ufl.edu), and was part of Jing Xie's dissertation.

We capture the linkage between pollination services in crop production and habitat conditions in the surrounding natural land with a bioeconomic model. Our case study is buckwheat, which is produced in the hilly and mountainous region of central Japan and is greatly dependent on diverse fauna for pollination services. We model the mechanism of regime shifts in ecosystems consisting of buckwheat fields and the surrounding natural land with a threshold estimation model. We then find that the forest around the crop fields, which serves as a habitat for wild pollinators, is a determinant of an ecological threshold that causes regime shifts. We calculate the shadow value of resilience provided by forest habitat around a unit of buckwheat field to be $ 9,796, implying that the total value of resilience in complex natural land amounts to half of the stock price of buckwheat land. This overlooked value gives us useful insights on the sustainable use of ecosystems, including both pollinator-mediated crop fields and habitats for pollinators.","[Matsushita, Kyohei] Shiga Univ, Fac Econ, Hikone, Japan; [Taki, Hisatomo] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yamane, Fumihiro] Hiroshima City Univ, Fac Int Studies, Hiroshima, Japan; [Asano, Kota] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan",Shiga University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Kyoto University,"Matsushita, K (通讯作者)，Shiga Univ, Fac Econ, Hikone, Japan.",k-mat-sushita@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp,,,"Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S15 Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services [PANCES]) of the Ministry of the Environment; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [16H04993]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H04993] Funding Source: KAKEN","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S15 Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services [PANCES]) of the Ministry of the Environment; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Kyohei Matsushita is an associate professor in the faculty of Economics, Shiga University, Japan.

Sales from greenhouses (GHs) are growing at 8.8%, while sales from vertical farms (VFs) are growing at 30%. It is commonly believed in industry circles that a VF cannot economically compete with a GH, due to the high cost of powering artificial lighting. Nonetheless, researchers have yet to analyze the economics underlying a VF, let alone compare the profitability of a VF to that of a GH.

The main empirical findings, contrary to what was expected, is that even though there was a precarious level of funding from the banking sector, credit from commercial banking was higher than that from development banking in the last decades.

Our focus is on the Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) in Mongolia. We analyze the effect of IBLI indemnity payments after a once-every-50-year winter disaster struck Mongolia over the winter of 2009/2010. The analysis is based on three waves of a household panel survey implemented in western Mongolia two to five years after the shock. We employ the bias-corrected matching estimator to account for selection into purchasing IBLI. Results indicate that pastoralist households purchasing IBLI before the shock recover faster from shock-induced asset losses than comparable uninsured households. We find a significant, positive, and economically large effect of IBLI indemnity payments on herd size one to three years after the shock. Four years after the shock, the effect vanishes. Results are robust to defining post-shock livestock recovery in various ways, as well as the choice of covariates and the use of alternative propensity score estimators. An analysis of shock-coping strategies suggests that IBLI appears to have relieved households from credit constraints. In addition, indemnity payments helped herders avoid selling and slaughtering animals, thus smoothing their productive asset base. Our article is among the first to provide evidence on the beneficial effects of index insurance after a weather shock in a developing economy.","[Bertram-Huemmer, Veronika; Kraehnert, Kati] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Res Grp Sustainable Dev, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Kraehnert, K (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Res Grp Sustainable Dev, Berlin, Germany.",kkraehnert@diw.de,,"Kraehnert, Kati/0000-0001-7319-9581",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LA1126A]; DIW Berlin; IIASA,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); DIW Berlin; IIASA,"The research was generously funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding line Economics of Climate Change, research grant 01LA1126A.

Using an index-number approach, this article analyzes these three closely-related tendencies. Stripping out the impact of prices from the dispersion of food expenditures gives a volume-based measure of diet diversity that is relevant for nutrition. Using unpublished data from the World Bank's International Comparison Program for 31 items of food in more than 150 countries, we find that diets of rich countries are substantially more diverse than those of the poor; and that volumes are the more appropriate way to measure the inequality of diversity. The quality of the food basket, based on the luxury-necessity distinction of consumption, increases with income, but the elasticity is small. There is a modest tendency for the structure of prices to be regressive since prices of luxuries relative to necessities are lower in richer countries. Additionally, our diversity and quality measures are shown to have implications for demand analysis and well-being.","[Clements, Kenneth W.; Si, Jiawei] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Clements, KW (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",ken.clements@uwa.edu.au,"Clements, Kenneth William/AAY-8440-2020","Clements, Kenneth William/0000-0002-7776-0724",ARC; BHP Billiton,ARC(Australian Research Council); BHP Billiton,This research was financed in part by the ARC and BHP Billiton.

The contribution to the trade balance index and the revealed comparative advantage index are used for the identification of changes in China's export competitiveness in agricultural products between 2001 and 2015. The World Trade Organization (WTO) trade liberalisation, followed by changes in the structure of economy, contributed to China building a trade deficit in the area of the agricultural products and losing competitiveness in some products. China gradually liberalised its agricultural trade in compliance with the WTO commitments. However, relatively high protection or state regulation of the domestic market has remained in products that China exports with a revealed comparative disadvantage. The existence of the state trading can also have a negative impact on the results of China's revealed comparative advantage in its exports of agricultural products.","[Fojtikova, Lenka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Fojtíková, L (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz,"Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023; Fojtikova, Lenka/A-1044-2017","Fojtikova, Lenka/0000-0002-1544-2421",Czech Science Foundation [17-22426S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"Supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project No. 17-22426S Law Aspects of China's Incorporation into the Global Trade System.",,24,6,7,23,142,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach A face-to-face interview was carried out with randomly selected farmers from three districts (Neijiang, Ya'an and Dujiangyan) of Sichuan province, China. A structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to test the conceptual framework of this study. The SEM was set to confirmatory factor analysis of the measurement and structural models for maximum likelihood estimate by means of IBM-AMOS to capture the models goodness-of-fit. Findings The result indicates that social network contributes a significant role in the development of farmers LC awareness, perception and adaptation intention decisions than media. The total (direct and indirect) effect of social network and media toward the farmers LC adaptation intention is 56.7 and 14 percent, respectively. When farmers are aware and perceived of LC and rehabilitation program, their adaptation intention improves significantly. Therefore, social network is a useful tool in improving the awareness, perception and adaptation intention decisions of Sichuan farmers compared to media.

Adherence to these standards was required under a federal marketing order that applied to essentially all tomatoes grown in Florida. The California Tomato Farmers cooperative, whose members produced the vast majority of fresh tomatoes grown in California, also required that its members adopt these standards. The collective food-safety standards for fresh tomatoes closely resemble the requirements of the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule, so the collective adoption of these standards provides an excellent case study to illustrate the possible effects of FSMA implementation on demand. I assess the hypothesis that demand for tomatoes from Florida and California increased following the adoption of standards for food-safety practices by growers in those states, relative to demand for tomatoes from other regions. My analysis demonstrates essentially no evidence that demand for fresh tomatoes responded positively to the implementation of collective food-safety practices.","[Bovay, John] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Bovay, J (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",john.bovay@uconn.edu,,,USDA-Economic Research Service [58-4000-0-0047]; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,USDA-Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics,"This article benefitted from the helpful comments of Julian Alston, Richard Sexton, Daniel Sumner, and Wei Zhang, as well as the editor, Awudu Abdulai, and anonymous referees.

Previous research showed that one important pathway for these MM-related welfare gains is through higher remittances received from relatives and friends. Here, the role of other impact pathways is examined, especially focusing on agricultural marketing and off-farm economic activities. The analysis builds on panel data from smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda. Regression models show that the adoption of MM technology has contributed to higher household incomes and consumption levels. Off-farm income gains are identified to be an important pathway, also beyond remittances. Typical off-farm income sources are small businesses in trade, transport, and handicrafts, which benefit from novel savings and money transfer opportunities through MM. In terms of agricultural marketing, MM users sell a larger proportion of their coffee as shelled beans to buyers in high-value markets, instead of selling to local traders immediately after harvest. MM services help to reduce cash constraints and facilitate transactions with buyers from outside local regions. In conclusion, MM can contribute to rural development through various important pathways. Analysis of adoption patterns suggests that MM services are socially inclusive.","[Sekabira, Haruna; Qaim, Matin] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Sekabira, H (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",haruna.sekabira@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; SEKABIRA, HARUNA/0000-0001-5675-7211",German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program [RTG 1666]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program (RTG 1666) and by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

Domestic use of certain fuel sources, such as cow dung, can hinder agricultural outcomes and productivity. This article explores the tradeoffs between domestic and productive uses of biomass energy sources in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia using a nonseparable farm household model where labor allocation to energy collection and farming are analyzed simultaneously. We estimate a system of five structural equations using three-stage least squares and find that the use of dung as a domestic fuel source has negative implications for the value of harvested crops, while use of on-farm fuelwood is associated with increased value of agricultural output. On-farm production of fuelwood appears to increase the value of crop output and provide labor savings, by making fuelwood collection more convenient for households. Policy interventions to support the expansion of agroforestry and increase access to new energy-efficient technologies are needed to ensure that agricultural productivity can be both increased and sustained.","[Mekonnen, Dawit; Bryan, Elizabeth; Ringler, Claudia] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Alemu, Tekie] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, POB 5563, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Addis Ababa University,"Bryan, E (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",e.bryan@cgiar.org,,"Mekonnen, Dawit/0000-0003-3642-3497; Bryan, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0906-222X","CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE)(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","This research was supported with generous funding from the CGIAR Research Programs on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE) and Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).",,33,23,25,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The model suggests that both higher efficiency and higher output price volatility make the farm more reluctant to irreversibly exit production. We test these hypotheses using farm panel data from 1997 to 2011 for milk producers in western Germany. Our findings confirm that ceasing operations in the dairy branch correlates with low efficiency of milk production and higher efficiency in other branches. A mild deviation from optimality, however, does not trigger immediate abandonment. Moreover, we find an attenuated impact of efficiency under more volatile market conditions.","[Pieralli, Simone; Odening, Martin] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Huettel, Silke] Univ Rostock, Rostock, Germany; [Pieralli, Simone] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Rostock,"Pieralli, S (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.;Pieralli, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",simone.pieralli@ec.europa.eu,"Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020; Hüttel, Silke/CAF-9025-2022","Huttel, Silke/0000-0002-2141-2931",German Research Foundation (DFG) through Research Unit 'Structural Change in Agriculture' [986],German Research Foundation (DFG) through Research Unit 'Structural Change in Agriculture',The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their helpful comments.

The effectiveness of such tax depends, however, on the price elasticity of demand for pesticides. Moreover, information on these demand elasticities and their determinants is of crucial relevance for policy-making and normative modeling approaches. In this article, we present a meta-analysis based on studies that have estimated pesticide demand elasticities in Europe and North America. Our meta-analysis reveals that the own-price elasticities of demand for pesticides are, with a median of -0.28, significantly smaller than zero, but also significantly larger than -1, i.e. to be inelastic. We find that the demand for pesticides for special crops is less elastic than that for arable and grassland. In addition, the demand for herbicides is more elastic than for other pesticides. Studies that consider only short-term horizons and little flexibility for farmers to adjust to price changes generate significantly less elastic pesticide demands. The results also indicate that more recent studies identify lower pesticide price elasticities of demand. Furthermore, we find that peer-reviewed studies tend to find more inelastic results compared to grey literature.","[Boecker, Thomas G.] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Finger, Robert] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bonn; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Böcker, TG (通讯作者)，Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany.",t.boecker@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture,Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture,"The authors would like to thank the two anonymous referees and the Editor for constructive comments and suggestions on an earlier version of this paper.

A key insight is that the ability of an AD duty to increase the welfare of producers in the country imposing the duty hinges on the import supply elasticity for product from non-named sources. The only instance in which this is not true is when supply for product from the named source is perfectly elastic. In this case, the welfare gain to domestic producers is maximised irrespective of the supply elasticity for imports from non-named sources. A comparison of the residual demand model with the Armington model suggests the latter significantly understates both trade diversion and domestic producer gains from the duty.","[Kinnucan, Henry W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Nguyen Duc Minh] Van Hien Univ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Zhang, Dengjun] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, Stavanger, Norway",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Kinnucan, HW (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",kinnuhw@auburn.edu,"Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224",Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Project [ALA011-2-14017],Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Project(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This research was funded by the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and contributes to Hatch Project ALA011-2-14017 'The Importance of U.S. Food and Agricultural Trade Policy in the New Global Market Environment'.

Nonetheless, partly because of difficulties in obtaining data, there is less literature on measurement error problems than on other endogeneity problems. This article examines estimation bias in the price elasticity of groundwater consumption for irrigated agriculture on the intensive margin. The price at issue is for the energy used in pumping and pressurizing water for delivery. Lacking the precise unit irrigation cost, previous studies imputed irrigation costs. We first consider groundwater irrigation costs and identify factors that can cause measurement errors in the process of imputation under incomplete information about the determinants of irrigation costs. We follow this by systematically analyzing the potential bias caused by measurement errors, using econometric theory along with Monte Carlo simulations where appropriate. We then quantify actual measurement errors, making use of a unique dataset in which energy and groundwater consumption data are matched for individual observations. Finally, we compare regression results using exact irrigation costs as opposed to imputed ones. We find evidence of substantial measurement errors resulting in attenuation and amplification bias in the price elasticity of irrigation water consumption on the intensive margin. Our results indicate that measurement errors in irrigation costs can lead to misleading policy implications related to water and energy pricing as a tool to conserve water. We also show that estimating the energy price elasticity of groundwater use is not as straightforward as previously thought.","[Mieno, Taro; Brozovic, Nicholas] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Brozovic, Nicholas] Univ Nebraska, Robert B Daugherty Water Food Global Inst, Policy, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Mieno, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,"Mieno, Taro/0000-0002-0614-0771",USDA-NIFA [2012-67003-23227],USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Taro Mieno, Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Nebraska-Lincoln; Nicholas Brozovic, Director of Policy, Robert B.

This expectation that more farmers should be using inorganic fertiliser, and at higher rates, implies it is profitable to use rates higher than observed if farmers are rational expected profit maximisers. We obtain consistent estimates of the effects of applied nitrogen on rice production. We find the yield response to applied nitrogen to be low in the main rice growing farming system. Farmer behaviour is not inconsistent with expected profitability which is limited by a low yield response to applied fertiliser, high transportation costs, and low selling prices for rice in rural areas. In particular, we do not find any farmers for whom applied nitrogen is profitable that are not using fertiliser in the study sample for each of our survey years (2010 and 2012).","[Liverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Liverpool-Tasie, LSO (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lliverp@msu.edu,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; MSU AgBio Research,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); MSU AgBio Research,"The author acknowledges and appreciates financial support for this work from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and MSU AgBio Research.

Statistical data regarding the selected bearer plant were used for the quantifi cation. Th e orchard of fruit trees was considered as a suitable representative of bearer plants. As it is clear from the results of the research, the measurement at fair value using the DCF method is based on the estimation which requires a relatively large source of input data for this estimation over the useful life of bearer plants. On the other hand, the eff ect on the value of the assets could be controversial and the eff ect on the profi t or loss during the useful life could be volatile. Although the objective of the fair value measurement is to achieve a true and fair view, in this case, the fulfi lment of this objective is at least controversial, since the biological assets in the form of bearer plants cannot be separately traded.","[Bohusova, Hana; Svoboda, Patrik] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svoboda, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Brno, Czech Republic.",ucpatrik@gmail.com,"Svoboda, Patrik/AAE-1145-2020; Bohušová, Hana/V-6173-2018","Svoboda, Patrik/0000-0002-2274-4778; Bohusova, Hana/0000-0002-3669-4230",Czech Science Foundation [15-24867S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant No. 15-24867S Small and medium size enterprises in global competition: Development of specific transfer pricing methodology reflecting their specificities).,,31,7,8,2,40,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Here, first a range of renewable energy goals across countries and the policies directed at achieving those objectives are reviewed. Second, the arguments advanced to support use of renewable energy policies in many nations are critiqued. Third, some principles are proposed for design of renewable energy policies. Context always matters, and it is essential to consider energy, economic, and geography opportunities and constraints before developing renewable energy policies. Fourth, to ensure renewable energy policies contribute towards attainment of high-level national goals, a decision support approach is outlined that considers the energy context, and asks a series of evaluation questions to aid identification of first best policy measures. Fifth, barriers to and benefits from implementation of appropriate renewable energy policies are briefly reviewed.","[Cullen, Ross] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Lincoln, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Cullen, R (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Lincoln, New Zealand.",Ross.cullen@lincoln.ac.nz,"Cullen, Ross/K-6370-2019",,,,,,47,15,15,10,126,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

While the market shares of these milk types are still small, specialty milk consumption is one of the fastest growing consumer segments in the dairy industry. Therefore, it is of interest to producers, consumers as well as the policy-makers to identify the consumer profile of these products and to determine policies based on the consumer choices. In the article, there are utilised the actual consumer sales data to see whether the USDA's dairy policy follows the consumers' milk preferences. The results indicate that the household demographics significantly affect milk preferences. Race is by far the most striking factor in the consumers' decision process. Minority households have a much higher probability of purchasing specialty milk types than the white households. They are also loyal customers of the specialty milk types and are less responsive to the changes in factors that affect their purchase decision. Based on these findings, there is recommend an alternative policy to the USDA's one-size-fits-all type of dairy guidelines.","[Gulseven, Osman] Amer Univ Middle East, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Wohlgenant, Michael] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC USA",American University of the Middle East; North Carolina State University,"Gulseven, O (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Middle East, Kuwait, Kuwait.",osmangulseven@hotmail.com,"Gulseven, Osman/G-4429-2017","Gulseven, Osman/0000-0002-1602-3376",,,,,39,16,18,0,33,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Such buffers ensure compliance with harvest targets up to a confidence level set by the manager, but represent foregone profits and create incentives for firms' voluntary investment in the provision of information that lessens the regulator's uncertainty. This paper characterizes conditions under which the fishing industry would willingly upgrade its reporting technology to provide accurate and timely catch data. Wireless technologies currently available to harvesters make the provision of real-time information feasible and affordable. Industry's incentives critically depend on the manager's expected choice of effort restrictions under the alternative technologies. Upgrading is attractive if the new distribution of reporting error shifts probability mass away from large errors so that the quantile at the confidence level is reduced. First-order stochastic dominance by the distribution under the baseline technology is a sufficient condition. Evidence from the Maryland Blue Crab Accountability Pilot Program, an industry-led initiative that tested the feasibility of adopting e-logbooks, illustrates the results. Real-time availability of accurate catch information under electronic reporting would translate into in-season adjustments of the manager's controls that could increase the industry's total harvest.","[Holzer, Jorge] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Holzer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jholzer@umd.edu,"Holzer, Jorge G/A-8128-2015","Holzer, Jorge/0000-0001-8978-3459",,,,,26,1,1,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on data from spot and futures market in China, this paper develops an improved B-S model for the calculation of crop price insurance premium and tests the possibility of hedging underwriting risks by insurance firms in the futures market. Findings - The authors find that spot price of crops in China can be estimated with agricultural commodity futures prices, and can be taken as the insured price for crop price insurance. The authors also find that improved B-S model yields better estimation of crop price insurance premium than traditional B-S model when spot price does not follow geometric Brownian motion. Finally, the authors find that hedging can be one good alternative for insurance firms to manage underwriting risks. Originality/value - This paper develops an improved B-S model that is data-driven in nature. Insured price of the crop price insurance, or the exercise price used in the B-S model, is estimated from a co-integration model built on spot and futures market price series. Meanwhile, distributional patterns of spot price series, one important factor determining the applicability of B-S model, is factored into the improved B-S model so that the latter is more robust and friendly to data with varied distributions. This paper also verifies the possibility of hedging of underwriting risks by insurance firms in the futures market.","[Ye, Minghua; Wang, Rongming] East China Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tuo, Guozhu] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Inst Agr Insurance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tongjiang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Capital University of Economics & Business; East China Normal University,"Wang, TJ (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",tjwang@finance.ecnu.edu.cn,"Wang, Rong/JQI-7854-2023; Yang, Min/JPY-3791-2023","Wang, Rong/0009-0009-5350-5743;",National Natural Science Foundation [71403088]; National Social Science Foundation Key Program [13ZD161]; Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Foundation [2013BGL005]; 111 Project [B14019],"National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation Key Program; Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Foundation; 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (71403088), the National Social Science Foundation Key Program (13&ZD161), Shanghai Philosophy and Social Science Foundation (2013BGL005), and the 111 Project (B14019).",,37,5,5,15,68,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Market designs have varied with some countries adopting 'energy-only' markets and others utilising capacity remuneration mechanisms. With increasing deployment of cost competitive renewable energy and the introduction of policy measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concerns are emerging about the sustainability of these market designs. In Australia, wholesale electricity prices have increased markedly - the result of a 'disorderly' transition away from coal to new renewable energy. This paper critically examines the 'energy-only' market in a high-penetration renewables system, with a particular focus on the vertically and horizontally restructured National Electricity Market (NEM). We propose that the 'energy-only' market can indeed work within a decarbonised energy system. But as renewables increasingly replace coal-fired power stations, 'unintended consequences' will need to be addressed to facilitate an 'orderly' transition. It will be important that policy ensures appropriate new investment in firm capacity is forthcoming; and pricing outcomes are acceptable given political economy constraints.","[Nelson, Tim; Orton, Fiona; Chappel, Tony] AGL Energy Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nelson, Tim] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Nelson, T (通讯作者)，AGL Energy Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",tanelson@agl.com.au,,,,,,,39,11,11,4,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This paper uses Swedish data on coffee products at the barcode level to evaluate pass-through from the cost of green coffee beans, the main marginal cost, to the retail price of roasted and ground coffee. First long-run cost pass-through is estimated for each product, and then regression is used to analyse how pass-through varies across market shares, retailer-owned brands and other product characteristics. A general result is that pass-through is roughly complete for products with large market shares, while those with small market shares have low pass-through rates. There is no evidence that retailer-owned brands have higher pass-through than brand-name products with similar market shares, which would be the case if retailer-owned brands avoided double marginalisation through vertical integration. Thus, although there is not perfect competition in the Swedish coffee market, a large part of it appears to be highly competitive.","[Durevall, Dick] HUI Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Durevall, Dick] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Durevall, D (通讯作者)，HUI Res, Stockholm, Sweden.;Durevall, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",dick.durevall@gu.se,,,Swedish Competition Authority,Swedish Competition Authority,"The author would like to thank Sven-Olof Daunfeldt, Niklas Rudholm, three anonymous reviewers and the editor for helpful comments.

A recent policy change in California offers a unique opportunity to measure the economic repercussions of minimum space requirements for egg-laying hens. Using forecasting methods and structural break tests as applied to sixteen years of monthly data on egg production and input prices, we find that by July 2016, both egg production and the number of egg-laying hens were about 35% lower than they would have been in the absence of the new regulations. Out-of-state eggs were able to compensate for falling California production until around the time the new rules were implemented, at which point imports of eggs into California fell. For consumers, we estimate price impacts using panel structural break tests and difference-in-differences models as applied to five years of scanner data from the retail market for shell eggs in three California markets and three control markets. We find that the average price paid per dozen eggs was about 22% higher from December 2014 through September 2016 than it would have been in the absence of the hen housing restrictions. The price impact fell over time, from an initial impact of about 33% per dozen to about 9% over the last six months of the observed time horizon. These price increases correspond to welfare losses of at least $ 117 million for the three California markets over the observed time horizon. Our results suggest that because of the policy change, California consumers can expect to experience annual welfare losses of at least $ 25 million in future years from higher retail egg prices alone.","[Mullally, Conner] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Mullally, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",connerm@ufl.edu,,"Mullally, Conner/0000-0001-5551-332X",,,,,29,35,41,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The model has realized widespread adoption for a number of purposes. Inherent in the model are a number of assumptions. An important and potentially restrictive assumption is that the underlying asset price is log-normally distributed. Among the many diverse uses of the BS model, the model and underlying theory are used to derive measurements of the variance of expected (harvest-time) prices for use in rating revenue coverage in the federal crop insurance program. Revenue coverage currently accounts for about 80% of the total liability insured in the program. This liability frequently exceeds $100 billion and thus the accuracy of revenue premium rates is of vital importance. The use of the BS model by the Risk Management Agency (RMA) of the USDA has been the focus of recent criticisms of the program. Critics have argued in favor of retrospective measures of price variability that are based on historical price movements or have recommended other approaches to measuring price risk. This article reports on a contracted review of revenue insurance rating methodology commissioned by RMA. We evaluate a number of alternative approaches to measuring expected price variability, including several approaches recommended by critics of the federal program. Our results suggest that the BS model is preferred to recommended alternatives on the basis of numerous criteria.","[Goodwin, Barry K.; Rejesus, Roderick M.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Goodwin, Barry K.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Harri, Ardian; Coble, Keith H.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; Mississippi State University,"Goodwin, BK (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;Goodwin, BK (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",barry_goodwin@ncsu.edu,"Coble, Keith H./A-3090-2008","Coble, Keith/0000-0003-4148-2870",Risk Management Agency of the USDA; NC Agricultural Research Service; U.S. Forest Service; BARD [IS-4693-14],Risk Management Agency of the USDA; NC Agricultural Research Service; U.S. Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); BARD,"This work was supported by the Risk Management Agency of the USDA.

An important source of agricultural R&D funding is the producer check-off, which is increasingly being used to fund applied agricultural research. Existing studies of producer-funded agricultural R&D indicate there are high private rates of return to agricultural R&D investment by farmers, and thus farmers are underinvesting in R&D. Since a farmer's time horizon is typically less than the period of time over which the benefits of agricultural R&D take place, the horizon problem has been identified as a possible factor in this underinvestment. This paper shows that the horizon problem is unlikely to be the only cause of the underinvestment when the internal rate of return is large. Instead, shortened producer horizons only emerge as the main source of underinvestment when the internal rate of return is low. As a result, other factors, including behavioral determinants, need to be looked at as contributors to the underfunding of agricultural R&D.","[Xiao, Zhihua] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zhihua] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Fulton, Murray] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada; [Fulton, Murray] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Study Cooperat, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada",Peking University; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Xiao, ZH (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, China Ctr Agr Policy, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Xiao, ZH (通讯作者)，Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",Zhihua.Xiao@pku.edu.cn; Murray.Fulton@usask.ca,"xiao, zhihua/IYJ-0074-2023","xiao, zhihua/0000-0002-1787-5271; Fulton, Murray/0000-0002-0351-5531",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71333013],National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is based on Zhihua Xiao's Ph.D. thesis that was funded by Alliance for Food and Bioproducts Innovation (AFBI).

Growth inputs, i.e. water, nutrients, seed and soil environment, become a part of the biological growth of plants, whereas facilitating inputs, i.e. labour, capital and pesticides, help regulate the functions of growth inputs from outside of the plants. This insight about the asymmetric role of agricultural inputs has been incorporated into agricultural economics on the basis of agronomic principles of crop production. The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of facilitating inputs on the technical efficiency of growth inputs. This analysis has been carried out semi-parametrically by employing the double bootstrap procedure on farm household level data from Pakistan. The results indicate that pesticides, capital and family labour scale up the technical efficiency of the growth inputs, whereas hired labour significantly scales down this efficiency. We recommend the creation of alternative employment opportunities for the rural labour force, provision of effective agricultural extension services to farm families, a minimisation of trade barriers to the import agricultural machinery and an enhancement of the extent of farm mechanisation.","[Iqbali, Naveed] Univ Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan; [Sial, Maqbool Hussain] Univ Management & Technol, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Sargodha; University of Management & Technology (UMT),"Iqbali, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan.",naveedeqbal@gmail.com,"Sial, Maqbool/AAR-8841-2020; Sial, Maqbool/GYV-2605-2022","Sial, Maqbool/0000-0002-0622-5337; Sial, Maqbool/0000-0003-4394-1460",,,,,30,3,4,0,7,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The original subjects of securitization are the risks emerging from the aftermaths of natural disasters. The range of securitized risks has broaden rapidly over the past decade. The reason of securitization's feasibility in transfer of agricultural risks is the spatial correlation of harvests among the producers that can result in fatal loss suffered simultaneously by many producers and subsequent producer's insolvency to settle the insurance claims. The paper proposes the reduction of the insurer's risk exposure by its transfer to capital markets via catastrophe bonds. A catastrophic event is defined through the relative loss of the current national per hectare yield of the particular crop to the average yield from previous years. The number of years included in the average is subject to the minimization of the relative loss' fluctuation over the given period. The triggering probability of the catastrophe bond is calculated from the kernel estimation of the loss distribution, with the relative loss being the loss index. The general case is upgraded by the factor of soil quality. The insurer is proposed to offer the coverage according to the producers' soil. The soil classes are securitized separately, with the set of catastrophe bonds. Both cases are illustrated by the numerical example on the data set of wheat produced in the Slovak Republic over last 45 years. The outcome of the examples are the graphs of expected payoffs depending on various parameters.","[Komadel, Daniel; Pinda, Ludovit; Sakalova, Katarina] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Komadel, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",dkomadel@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,6,6,1,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

First, holding insurance coverage constant, premium subsidies directly increase expected profit, which encourages more acreage of insured crops (direct profit effect). Second, premium subsidies encourage farms to increase crop insurance coverage. With more insurance coverage, farms obtain more subsidies, and farm revenue becomes less variable as indemnities offset revenue shortfalls, so acreage of insured crops likely increases (indirect coverage effect). By exploiting exogenous policy changes and using approximately 180,000 county-crop-year observations, we estimate the sum of these two effects of premium subsidies on the pattern of U.S. acreage across seven major field crops. We estimate that a 10% increase in the premium subsidy causes a 0.43% increase in the acreage of a crop in a county holding the premium subsidy of its competing crop constant. Taking into account the small share of premium subsidies in expected crop revenue, this subsidy impact is analogous to an own-subsidy acreage elasticity of 1.24, which exceeds own-price acreage elasticity estimates in the literature. One explanation for the larger acreage response to premium subsidies is that insurance causes an indirect coverage effect in addition to a direct profit effect.","[Yu, Jisang] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Sumner, Daniel A.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr Issues Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Kansas State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Yu, JS (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jisangyu@ksu.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011; Yu, Jisang/JOZ-5167-2023","Yu, Jisang/0000-0003-3936-1877",,,,,50,60,77,6,88,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This is pursued by applying a vector error correction model and an impulse response analysis using monthly price data for the period 2000-2015. Our analysis considers transmission of price shocks across different market levels, including from the international and domestic wheat grain markets at the upstream to the domestic wheat bread market at the downstream of the value chain. The empirical findings indicate that significant cointegration exists across prices of the different market stages. There is a transmission from international prices to domestic prices at downstream markets, in particular to flour and bread prices. Prices at upstream markets are largely influenced by the domestic wholesale market. In general, the speed of adjustment is quite slow with a half-life of about one year for restoring the equilibrium price relationship. As price margins between the different market stages in the value chain have substantially decreased in the last 15 years, higher transmission, and thus exposure to international market shocks, can be expected in the future. The results also show that causal relationships exist between prices at different market stageswith the wholesale market identified as the key market level where prices and price expectations are formed.","[Haile, Mekbib G.; Algieri, Bernardina] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Kalkuhl, Matthias] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Kalkuhl, Matthias] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Algieri, Bernardina] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Gebreselassie, Samuel] Ethiopian Econ Assoc EEA, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Bonn; University of Potsdam; University of Calabria,"Haile, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",mekhaile@uni-bonn.de,,"Kalkuhl, Matthias/0000-0003-4797-6628",European Commission via the FOODSECURE research project; Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany (BMZ),European Commission via the FOODSECURE research project; Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany (BMZ),The authors thank the European Commission via the FOODSECURE research project and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany (BMZ) for partial funding of this research.

It is claimed that passive farming is hindering agricultural development by 'blocking' access to farmland for expanding farmers. We evaluate the links between the EU's Single Payment Scheme (SPS), passive farming, land use and agricultural development. Following identification of the rational landowners' optimal land-use choice, we evaluate the effects of the SPS using a spatial, agent-based model that simulates farmers' competition for land in a case-study region of Sweden. We show that passive farming does not constrain land from being used in production; on the contrary more land is used than would be the case without the SPS. We conclude that passive farming is not a problem for agriculture, but provides public goods that would otherwise be under provided: preservation of marginal farmland and future food security. However SPS payments on highly productive land inflate land values (capitalisation) and slow structural change, which hinder agricultural development. Consequently CAP goals could be better served by targeting payments on marginal land and phasing out payments to highly productive land.","[Brady, Mark V.; Hristov, Jordan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Umea, Sweden; [Brady, Mark V.; Hristov, Jordan] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res CEC, Lund, Sweden; [Sahrbacher, Christoph] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Soderberg, Torben] Swedish Board Agr, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Wilhelmsson, Fredrik] Lund Univ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Lund, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lund University; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Lund University,"Brady, MV (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Econ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Umea, Sweden.",mark.brady@slu.se,"Change, Structural/W-8306-2019; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Brady, Mark/J-6313-2014","Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; Brady, Mark/0000-0001-9773-9722; Hristov, Jordan/0000-0002-9303-5645",Swedish Research Council FORMAS [220-2013-273],Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Christoph Sahrbacher is in the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies (IAMO), Halle (Saale), Germany.

A double-hurdle model is estimated using three waves of panel data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey. Unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for using a correlated random effect procedure and potential endogeneity of explanatory variables using a control function approach. The results show that off-farm income has no significant influence on household crop output market participation. However, conditional on market participation, additional off-farm earnings negatively affect the marketed surplus. This indicates that farmers use off-farm earnings for consumption rather than for investment in agricultural production. Policy measures that promote rural investment may help increase returns to labor for land-poor households participating in off-farm work in the process of agricultural commercialization.","[Woldeyohanes, Tesfaye; Heckelei, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Surry, Yves] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Bonn; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Woldeyohanes, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",tesfaye.woldeyohanes@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Heckelei, Thomas/C-2714-2011; Woldeyohanes, Tesfaye/W-4467-2019; Woldeyohanes, Tesfaye/JHU-5130-2023","Heckelei, Thomas/0000-0002-6251-3480; Woldeyohanes, Tesfaye/0000-0002-6663-5653;","EU Commission under the Erasmus Mundus AFEPA program; German Research Foundation (DFG) under the Research Unit 1501 Resilience, collapse and reorganization of social ecological systems in African Savannahs","EU Commission under the Erasmus Mundus AFEPA program; German Research Foundation (DFG) under the Research Unit 1501 Resilience, collapse and reorganization of social ecological systems in African Savannahs(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The authors are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

The results indicate that under moderate energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) prices, net electricity generation reaches 6.5 billion kWh annually. Net emission reduction is affected by market operations. At high GHG prices, pyrolysis and biochar application can sequester up to 4.74 million tons of CO2R emissions annually. However, this measure fluctuates significantly when GHG prices vary. Our study shows that pyrolysis and biochar application provide significant environmental effects in terms of carbon sequestration.","[Cao, Xiaoyong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kung, Chih-Chun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuelong] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Regulat & Competit, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Kung, CC (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",cckung78@hotmail.com,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [14YQ02]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41161087, 71263018, 71663022, 71663024, 71663025, 71673123]; National Social Science Foundation of China: Major Project [2015YZD16]; Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangxi Province [2013KY56]; Soft Science Research Program of Jiangxi [20161BBA10071]; China Postdoctoral Foundation [2013M531552, 2015T80685]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China: Major Project; Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Soft Science Research Program of Jiangxi; China Postdoctoral Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"Xiaoyong Cao acknowledges the financial support of the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE (14YQ02) and Chih-Chun Kung acknowledges financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41161087; No. 71263018; No. 71663022; No. 71663024; No. 71663025; No. 71673123), National Social Science Foundation of China: Major Project (No. 2015YZD16), Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 2013KY56), Soft Science Research Program of Jiangxi (No. 20161BBA10071) and China Postdoctoral Foundation (No. 2013M531552; No. 2015T80685).",,48,7,7,3,33,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We explore a somewhat novel explanation for this puzzle-the link between market access and the incentives to adopt a new technology when there are non-convexities. We develop a theoretical model to guide the empirical analysis that uses spatially disaggregated agricultural production data from the International Food Policy Research Institute and Living Standards Measurement Study survey data for Nigeria. We estimate the impact of transport costs on crop production, adoption of modern technologies, and the differential impact on returns of modern versus traditional farmers. To overcome the limitation of data availability on travel costs for much of Africa, we combine road survey data and GIS roads networks to generate the most thorough and accurate road network available, to our knowledge. Using these data and the Highway Development Management Model (HDM-4), we compute minimum travel costs from each location to the market. Consistent with our theory we find that transportation costs are critical in determining technology choices, with a greater responsiveness among farmers who adopt modern technologies, and at times a perverse (negative) response to lower transport costs among those who employ more traditional techniques. In sum, we present compelling evidence that the constraints to the adoption of modern technologies and access to markets are interconnected, and so should be targeted jointly.","[Damania, Richard; Berg, Claudia; Russ, Jason; Barra, A.

Through the expectile estimator, the demand system can be estimated not only at the mean, as is generally done when implementing the OLS, but also at the lower and higher levels of expenditure. A simple demand system of equations focusing on five basic goods: Food, Recreation, Clothing, Transport, Rent, using the Canadian Family Expenditure Survey data was estimated. The comparison of the estimated elasticity of each commodity at the selected expectiles is tested to verify the statistical relevance of any difference among the estimates in the tails and those computed at the centre of the conditional distribution. The results show with a strong evidence that the elasticity of Food and Recreation grows across the expectiles. Clothing variations are less evident, while the Transport and Rent elasticity is basically constant across the expectiles.","[Furno, Marilena; Caracciolo, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Caracciolo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy.",Francesco.caracciolo@unina.it,"Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013","Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529",,,,,35,0,0,0,5,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

From the results, it is obvious that with the increasing distance to the bankruptcy, there decreases the average accuracy of the financial distress prediction and there is a greater difference between the active and distressed companies in terms of liquidity, rentability and debt ratios. The Decision trees and Adaptive Boosting off er a better accuracy for the distress prediction than the SVM and logit methods, what is comparable to the previous studies. From the total of 15 accounting variables, there were constructed classification trees by the Decision Trees with the inner feature selection method for the better visualization, what reduces the full data set only to 1 or 2 attributes: ROA and Long-term Debt to Total Assets Ratio in 2011, ROA and Current Ratio in 2012, ROA in 2013 for the discrimination of the distressed companies.","[Klepac, Vaclav; Hampel, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Klepac, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic.",xklepac@node.mendelu.cz,"Hampel, David/B-6765-2013","Hampel, David/0000-0002-3865-5948",Czech Science Foundation [GA13-25897S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Grant No. GA13-25897S).,,22,21,23,2,31,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs field data in Hebei Province and comprehensively applies the ordinary least squares regression model and the difference-in-difference matching method. Findings - The findings show that participation in the Program may not obviously increase household consumption, rather it significantly inhibits the marginal propensity of young families' consumption temporarily without an apparent impact on participating households' consumption. Practical implications -In addition to maintain the stability of the basic system framework of the new rural social pension program and preserve or increase the value of the fund under the Program, dynamic adjustments to pension levels should be made as and when appropriate. Originality/value - The study provides a new empirical evidence for the relationship between the new rural social pension program and consumption and gives insight into potential modifications and improvements to the Program.","[Su, Baozhong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Su, BZ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",subaozhong@sina.com,,,,,,,21,2,3,3,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This paper considers two hypothetical scenarios: one revolving around a fallback to most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rates and the other considering the additional effect of increased transaction costs in intraregional trade. Results from a computable general equilibrium model indicate that applying MFN tariff rates to U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade would lead to a 14.43% reduction in these trade flows, while a scenario also featuring higher transaction costs would bring an even larger reduction (21.25%). In both scenarios, almost every agricultural product experiences a reduction in bilateral trade, with U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico undergoing some of the largest proportionate decreases. Many sectors within North American agriculture would have lower output, including fruit and nuts, vegetables, oilseeds and vegetable oils, and processed foods in Canada; fruit, vegetables, and beef in Mexico; and poultry meat, pork, beef, and dairy products in the United States.","[Beckman, Jayson; Zahniser, Steven] ERS, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave,SW,Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zahniser, S (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave,SW,Mailstop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",zahniser@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,37,1,2,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The results show that: (i) access to public climate information and technical or physical support increases the likelihood that farmers adapt to climate change by undertaking irrigation and/or drainage measures; and (ii) decisions to adapt increased crop yield, but they did not significantly increase crop profit margins. This point appears to have been ignored by previous studies. Based on these new empirical results, the paper suggests that government should continue to provide climate information and various types of supports to improve farmers' adaptation abilities and help to reduce the levels of factor input by, for example, substituting organic for chemical fertiliser inputs.

Farmers answered a detailed questionnaire designed to learn about losses during harvest and transport, processing and storage and which measures both complete losses and crop damage. The findings indicate that fewer than half of households report suffering losses conditional on growing each crop. Conditional on losses occurring, the loss averages between 5 and 12 per cent of the farmer's total harvest. Compared to nationally representative data that measure losses using a single survey question, this study documents a far greater percentage of farmers experiencing losses. We find that losses are concentrated in harvest and processing activities for groundnuts and maize; for soya, they are highest during processing. Existing interventions have primarily targeted storage activities; however, these results suggest that targeting other activities may be worthwhile.","[Ambler, Kate; de Brauw, Alan] IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Godlonton, Susan] Williams Coll, Econ, Schapiro Hall, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Williams College,"de Brauw, A (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",alandebrauw@gmail.com,,,"Department of International Development of the United Kingdom; CGIAR's Policy, Institutions, and Markets Consortium Research Project","Department of International Development of the United Kingdom; CGIAR's Policy, Institutions, and Markets Consortium Research Project","We thank the Department of International Development of the United Kingdom for the main financial support behind the data collection and primary intervention, and CGIAR's Policy, Institutions, and Markets Consortium Research Project for financial support.

The only significant difference between the sugarcane production on the factory-operated sugarcane plantation and on the outgrower-operated plots is the remuneration system and thus, the incentives to the workers. We compare the productivity of these two production schemes using a cross-sectional plot-level data set. As sugarcane production depends on various exogenous factors that are measured as categorical variables (e.g., soil type, cane variety, etc.), we estimate the production function by a nonparametric kernel regression method that takes into account both continuous and categorical explanatory variables without assuming a functional form and without imposing restrictions on interactions between the explanatory variables. Our results show that outgrower-operated plots haveceteris paribusa statistically and economically significantly higher productivity than factory-operated plots, which can be explained by outgrowers having stronger incentives to put more effort into their work than the employees of the sugar factory.","[Wendimu, Mengistu Assefa] Univ Manitoba, Dept Sociol, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Wendimu, Mengistu Assefa] Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Henningsen, Arne; Czekaj, Tomasz Gerard] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba; University of Copenhagen,"Wendimu, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Sociol, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.;Wendimu, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",assefameng@yahoo.com,"Henningsen, Arne/I-8113-2013","Henningsen, Arne/0000-0002-6720-0264",Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,"This research was funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.

We estimate a location-specific and panel vector error correction models (VECM) for seven elevators in Ontario from 2006 to 2013. We find a long-run equilibrium relationship exists between the basis and factors affecting local supply and demand including ethanol capacity and that the direction of causality is from these factors to changes in corn price. A one-time increase in ethanol capacity of 100 million liters is projected to increase the basis by approximately 30 cents per bushel within two years. However, the impact is insignificant for elevators located in the livestock-intensive regions of the province. The demand for corn as livestock feed is a determinant of the local corn price for all elevators. The decline in the number of hogs and beef cattle along with the 50% increase in corn supply have resulted in the observed decline in the local corn price despite the significant increase in demand from ethanol.","[Wu, Zhige; Weersink, Alfons; Hailu, Getu; Vyn, Richard] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Weersink, Alfons] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Maynard, Alex] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Maynard, Alex] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Western Australia; University of Guelph; University of Toronto,"Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada.;Weersink, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",zhige@uoguelph.ca; aweersin@uoguelph.ca; maynarda@uoguelph.ca; ghailu@uoguelph.ca; rvyn@uoguelph.ca,"Weersink, Alfons/O-1521-2019; Maynard, Alex/T-8253-2019; Wu, Zhige/JJE-8670-2023","Weersink, Alfons/0000-0001-5081-3593; Maynard, Alex/0000-0002-0596-527X; Wu, Zhige/0000-0002-9408-8861; Hailu, Getu/0000-0003-1257-5939",Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF); SSHRC [410-2010-0074],Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF).

This payment for each kilogram of raw milk processed into cheese is issued to milk producers through dairy processors. In the ex post evaluation, by applying a vector autoregressive model, we estimate the effects of reductions of the payment for prices of raw milk used to produce Emmentaler, Gruyere, and industrial cheese. Past declines in the payment have only been partially transmitted to raw milk prices. The rate of transmission is higher for milk used for the production of industrial cheese than for artisan cheeses. In the ex ante impact evaluation, we use a partial equilibrium model and develop a counterfactual scenario in which the payment is removed. The payment for milk processed into cheese is found to have effects on cheese production and exports but also has important indirect effects on other dairy products. Our findings suggest that about two-thirds of the payment are benefiting milk producers. At the same time, the overall welfare losses resulting from the elimination of the aid are smaller than the budget allocated to this measure, suggesting a net welfare gain from elimination.","[Finger, Robert] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Listorti, Giulia; Tonini, Axel] Swiss Fed Off Agr, Mattenhofstr 5, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Finger, R (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rofinger@ethz.ch,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture,Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture,"We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers and the editor for helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier version of this article.

Despite a burgeoning body of literature on program impacts, the political economy of the programs remains poorly understood. In particular, there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support or refute the conventional wisdoms that governments systematically target subsidized inputs to certain areas based on past voting patterns and that fertilizer subsidies win votes. This article discusses the theoretical links between government targeting of subsidized fertilizer and voter behavior, then uses panel data from Zambia to empirically test these conventional wisdoms. Results suggest that Zambia's Movement for Multi-Party Democracy governments targeted more subsidized fertilizer to households in areas where it had strong support in the previous presidential election. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, marginal changes in the scale or coverage of the fertilizer subsidy program had no statistically significant effect on the share or number of votes won by incumbent presidents.","[Mason, Nicole M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ AFRE, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jayne, Thomas S.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jayne, Thomas S.] Michigan State Univ, AFRE, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [van de Walle, Nicolas] Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Cornell University,"Mason, NM (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ AFRE, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",masonn@msu.edu,,,USAID Zambia Mission [611-A-00-11-00001-00],USAID Zambia Mission(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors sincerely appreciate the comments of the editor, JunJie Wu, and two anonymous reviewers.

It then identifies its determinants by applying an interval regression procedure on a sample of 317 farmers from north-western Bangladesh. Results reveal that the mean level of the OFEDI-adjusted production efficiency (i.e. eco-efficiency) is 89 per cent, whereas ignoring OFEDI adjustment (i.e. with OFEDI=0) reduces the mean level of efficiency to 69 per cent, implying that the production of undesirable output or on-farm environmental damage induces an efficiency loss of 20 per cent with significant differences across regions. The proportion of farmers' income from HYV rice agriculture, land ownership, extension services and socio-environmental living standard are the significant determinants of improving eco-efficiency. Policy implications include investments in extension services and land reform measures to increase land ownership, which will synergistically improve eco-efficiency of HYV rice production in Bangladesh.","[Sabiha, Noor-E.] Rajshahi Univ, Dept Econ, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Rahman, Sanzidur] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Rajshahi; Curtin University; University of Plymouth,"Salim, R (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia.",Ruhul.Salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Rahman, Sanzidur/AAO-6993-2020","Rahman, Sanzidur/0000-0002-0391-6191",,,,,32,12,13,3,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

First, we model the decision to be certified organic as a conditionally independent decision from the farmer's chosen market channels. Second, we estimate the probability of certifying organic as an endogenously determined marketing decision to the choice of market channels, and use a bivariate probit specification to model this decision. Empirical evidence indicates that the decision to certify is endogenous to the chosen market channels.

The model is empirically grounded and reproduces past values well. It uses a new reduced-form approach to capture private storage dynamics. We evaluate the implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) under several policy measures with the current regime as well as two scenarios with a regime change - implementation of cash transfers and deficiency payments. Implications for market fundamentals and fiscal costs are simulated in the medium term - until 2020/21. The NFSA puts a high pressure on fiscal costs and public stocks. Relying on imports with low support prices results in low fiscal costs and stable, but higher domestic and international prices, and a high risk of zero stocks. A policy strategy to manipulate procurement prices in order to maintain public stocks close to the norms leads to slightly higher fiscal costs with lower, but more volatile prices. The highest domestic price volatility occurs under a strategy which uses export bans in order to maintain sufficient public stocks. A cash-based regime can bring considerable savings and curb fiscal costs, particularly if targeted to the poor, and would leave sufficient stocks due to higher private stocks.","[Kozicka, Marta; Brockhaus, Jan] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Kalkuhl, Matthias] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Kalkuhl, Matthias] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Potsdam, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Potsdam,"Kozicka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",marta.kozicka@uni-bonn.de,,"Kalkuhl, Matthias/0000-0003-4797-6628; Kozicka, Marta/0000-0002-2323-3689",German Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ); European Commission,German Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The research leading to this publication has been funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ) within the research project 'Analysis and Implementation of Measures to Reduce Price Volatility in National and International Markets for Improved Food Security in Developing Countries' and by the European Commission within the 'Food Secure' research project.

Based on a sample of 204 respondents from Perth, WA, we found that the majority of respondents did not object to the practice of biodiversity offsetting in general. A minority of respondents preferred that offset actions be direct, but most accepted a combination of direct and indirect actions. Individuals generally preferred that the offset be located near the site of impact, and it became more unacceptable the further away that it was located.

An integer optimization model is applied to identify optimal strategies to deal with invasive species at a steady state. Optimal strategies depend on the spatial location of invasion as well as on stochastic characteristics of spread and control. Previous studies of invasive-species control have been stochastic or spatial, but not both. We model a landscape as consisting of multiple cells, each of which may be subject to border control or eradication within the cell. Optimal strategies from the model are characterized as eradication, containment, or abandonment of control. Representing the rate of species spread as stochastic rather than deterministic results in less-intensive control becoming optimal at equilibrium. The optimal strategy may switch from eradication to containment or from containment to abandonment. If an infestation occurs at the boundary of the region within which it may spread, it is more likely to be optimal to eradicate or contain the species, compared to an infestation in the interior of the region. If the effectiveness of border control is stochastic, then containment is not feasible in the long term, but it is still optimal as a temporary measure in some scenarios.","[Chalak, Morteza; Polyakov, Maksym; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Chalak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",morteza.chalak@uwa.edu.au,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008; Polyakov, Maksym/G-1523-2010","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Polyakov, Maksym/0000-0002-0193-6658",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; Australian National Environmental Research Program's Environmental Decisions Hub,Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); Australian National Environmental Research Program's Environmental Decisions Hub,"Morteza Chalak is an assistant professor, (research) Maksym Polyakov is an assistant professor (research), and David J.

Design/methodology/approach - First, an event study is employed to investigate the impact of regulatory changes on the food industry. Then the authors examine the association between the magnitude of cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and firm characteristics in a cross-sectional regression framework. Findings - The results suggest that the announcements of some important events during the legislative process do affect the investors' expectations. Further analysis shows that some sub-industries, especially the dairy industry, underperform the others around the enforcement date of the Food Safety Law, indicating that investors expect more costs of compliance for the sub-industries with lower levels of food safety. Moreover, CARs are found to be positively correlated with firm size, implying that larger firms may benefit more from this food legislative reform than small ones. Practical implications - Measuring the impact of regulatory changes on food producers and investors by stock market response could help regulators assess the effectiveness of regulation and amend the law accordingly.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors utilize two waves of nationwide micro survey data in China, China General Social Survey 2005 and 2013, to investigate the impacts of new media coverage on non-farm employment and earnings in rural China with the ordered probit model and instrument variables. Findings - The authors find that promotion of new media coverage can significantly enhance rural non-farm employment in China by 10-20 percent and ultimately increase earnings for rural residents. The findings provide new evidence for the new media as a potential newly emerging pathway out of poverty for rural areas. The conclusions are robust regarding a variety of controls and model specifications, evaluations with alternative measures, examinations within different subsamples, and estimations with constructed pseudo panels. Social implications - Encouragement of new media coverage in rural China not only can improve the rural non-farm employment and living standards but also can contribute toward narrowing the differences between urban and rural areas, thereby balancing regional development.

While work within nutritional science suggests that stunting in early childhood is associated with low intakes of animal-sourced foods (ASFs), this topic has received little attention from economists. We attempt to redress this omission through an analysis of 130,432 children aged 6-23 months from 49 countries. We document distinctive patterns of ASF consumption among children in different regions. We find evidence of strong associations between stunting and a generic ASF consumption indicator, as well as dairy, meat/fish, and egg consumption indicators, and evidence that consuming multiple ASFs is more advantageous than any single ASF. We explore why ASF consumption is low but also so variable across countries. Non-tradable ASFs (fresh milk, eggs) are a very expensive source of calories in low-income countries and caloric prices of these foods are strongly associated with children's consumption patterns. Other demand-side factors are also important, but the strong influence of prices implies an important role for agricultural policies-in production, marketing and trade-to improve the accessibility and affordability of ASFs in poorer countries.","[Headey, Derek; Hirvonen, Kalle] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Hoddinott, John] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Cornell University,"Headey, D (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1112307]; CGIAR Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the grant Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA) Phase II [OPP1177007]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1177007, OPP1112307] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); CGIAR Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)(CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the grant Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (ARENA) Phase II(CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This research was conducted under the Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (AReNA) project, supported by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Investment ID: OPP1112307) and the CGIAR Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH).

We motivate our findings through the use of a conceptual model that emphasizes that the impact of cash and food transfers on dimensions of food consumption-both quantity and quality-will differ by the income level of the household and whether or not the food transfer is extra-marginal. Consistent with this model, households in localities randomized to receive the food basket experienced larger, positive impacts on measures of dietary diversity than those receiving the cash transfer. By contrast, households receiving cash were more likely to make bulk purchases of grains and spent more money on private transfers and debts. Despite the seasonal dimensions to food insecurity in Niger, the relative impact of food and cash transfers on our measures of dietary diversity did not vary markedly by season.","[Hoddinott, John] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Sandstrom, Susanna] World Food Programme, Rome, Italy; [Upton, Joanna] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Hoddinott, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,"Government of Spain through the World Food Programme; CGIAR's Policy, Institutions, and Markets research program","Government of Spain through the World Food Programme; CGIAR's Policy, Institutions, and Markets research program","John Hoddinott is a professor in the Division of Nutritional Sciences and the Charles H.

The popular health claim of lowering cholesterol has a significantly positive influence on MWTP.

The exceptional size of the crop and the harsh winter weather contributing to this costly event raise an important question as to whether additional investment in export capacity is warranted. This study systematically assesses the need for additional grain export capacity in Western Canada. Somewhat conservative grain production forecasts and rational expectations storage are used within a spatial mathematical programming model to simulate a competitive market, moving grain to export positions. We find in the absence of additional export capacity there will be increasingly frequent periods of costly congestion. A 10 million tonnes (Mt) (5 Mt) improvement in both rail and West Coast capacity implies $9.2 billion ($6.0 billion) of cost-saving benefits for the producers over the 2016-25 period. While these estimates are sensitive to future realized production levels, their magnitude suggests that innovation to increase export capacity is economically important for grain producers in Western Canada.","[Torshizi, Mohammad] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Fac Agr Life & Environm Sci, Rm 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Gray, Richard] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 3E64 Agr Bldg,51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Saskatchewan,"Torshizi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Fac Agr Life & Environm Sci, Rm 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",torshizi@ualberta.ca; richard.gray@usask.ca,,"TORSHIZI, MOHAMMAD/0000-0001-5905-4132; Gray, Richard Stanley/0000-0002-2073-3987",Saskatchewan Wheat Development Commission; Mitacs program,Saskatchewan Wheat Development Commission; Mitacs program,The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of Saskatchewan Wheat Development Commission and the Mitacs program.,,32,4,4,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The assessment distinguishes between rents and intra-marginal profits-the sum of which constitutes variable profits in the fishery. A bioeconomic model combining fish population dynamics and the economics of the fishery is constructed to allow the computation of these different components of profits. In order to assess the dynamics of both rents and intra-marginal profits, the model is computed under various assumptions with regard to price, costs, and discount rates. Potential total profits are measured at 88 pound to 89 pound million annually, of which rents make up about 87 pound million with intra-marginal profits measured in the order of only 2 pound million.

A representative orange grower planting early-mid varieties for the processed market is featured in the case. The study assumes that an existing grove has become disease-infested to a degree that there is little, if any economic value in maintaining it. The grower is left with the choice to replant the grove or to convert the land to other uses. The replanting baseline model yields a 9.7% Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) and the Monte Carlo simulation shows that MIRR is equal or higher than the 7.5% hurdle rate around 81% times the model is simulated. The risk of managing an orange grove is higher than a decade ago mainly due to the presence of citrus greening, a disease that reduces yields and degrades fruit quality, causing variability in productivity and operating costs. Opportunities for growers include planting incentive programs implemented by both the government and major citrus processors and from policy changes such as the possibility of changes in depreciation of new investment for income tax purposes. Readers of this case study are expected to challenge the assumptions of the financial model and consider additional elements of risk and opportunities on their assessment of the potential orange grove investment.","[Trejo-Pech, Carlos J.

Design/methodology/approach The model applied in this paper is based on Hall's framework (Hall, 1988, 1990) and Klette (1999). The paper relaxes the assumption of constant returns to scale, and estimates market power and rate of returns to scale simultaneously, and then employs a covariance approach to examine the relationship between market power, scale economy and productivity via an unbalanced panel data at firm level. Findings Empirical results indicate that all the selected seven food industries are characterized with significant market power, especially for China's cigarette industry whose markup is as almost five times as the smallest one. In addition, China's soybean and cigarette sectors are manifested to have scale economy, with return to scale being larger than 1, while the other five sectors are proved to have decreasing returns to scale. Empirical results also provide evidence to support significant negative correlations between market power and scale economy in all sectors, and negative correlations between market power and productivity in most of the selected sectors. While more heterogeneous relationship between scale economy and productivity are found across the selected sectors. Originality/value This paper contributes to examine the relationship between market power, scale economy and productivity empirically for Chinese food manufacturers using a firm-level unbalanced panel data. Results which coincide well with the reality provide policy implication on understanding the situation of market structure for China's food and tobacco industry.","[Dai, Jiawu] Hunan Normal Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Xun] Wuhan Univ, Dept Math Econ & Math Finance, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Cai, Hailong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hunan Normal University; Wuhan University; China Agricultural University,"Cai, HL (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",caihlmail@gmail.com,"Dai, Jiawu/AAV-5017-2021",,Science Foundation of Hunan Province Research on the Mechanism of Market Power's effect on Technology Innovation for Chinese Manufacturing [2018JJ3358]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Wuhan University) [413000018]; National Science Foundation in China [71602149],Science Foundation of Hunan Province Research on the Mechanism of Market Power's effect on Technology Innovation for Chinese Manufacturing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Wuhan University); National Science Foundation in China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial supports from Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2018JJ3358) Research on the Mechanism of Market Power's effect on Technology Innovation for Chinese Manufacturing; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 413000018 from Wuhan University); and The National Science Foundation in China (No. 71602149).

Eco-efficiency is obtained by the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) using a generalized maximum entropy (GME) approach. Agriculture gross value added (GVA) is considered as the desirable output and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as the undesirable output. Capital, labour, land, energy and nutrients are regarded as inputs. The GVA/GHG ratio is the measure of eco-efficiency. The estimation was made for the years 2005 and 2010, which correspond to the year of commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the most recent year with information concerning all the variables in the study, and is a period that can allow us to see some changes after the agreement. The results show that in 2005, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Portugal revealed the higher levels of eco-efficiency; and countries such as Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Latvia and Slovakia are the group with the lowest levels of eco-efficiency.

In light of this, an empirical analysis of the determinants of dual margins indicates that larger trading partners lead to less growth in exports of both new and existing products. Destination countries with higher labor productivities and lower fixed trade costs are China's target markets to convert intensive-margin-driven growth into extensive-margin-driven growth. In addition, the impact of relative labor productivity and free trade agreements on the intensive margin differs between primary and processed products due to their product characteristics.","[Zhang, Xiaoheng; Zhou, Yingheng; Geng, Xianhui; Tian, Xu] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoheng] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Lab IBISC, F-91020 Evry, France",Nanjing Agricultural University; Universite Paris Saclay,"Geng, XH (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xuyizxh@163.com; zhouyh@njau.edu.cn; gengxh@njau.edu.cn; xutian@njau.edu.cn,,", xu/0000-0002-1070-3581; Zhang, Xiaoheng/0000-0003-0146-8687",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333008]; National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science of China [14ZDA037]; PHC Cai Yuanpei Program [34644SB]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions PAPD,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science of China; PHC Cai Yuanpei Program; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions PAPD,"We would like thank Professor Wuyang Hu, University of Kentucky, USA, for his great suggestions in this study.

Since participation requires commitment to long-term contracts, most studies on participation focus on changes to the pecuniary incentives facing land owners. This study presents a large-scale field experiment within the USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that examines whether informational outreach, including behavioral nudges, could improve land owners' willingness to participate. The experiment evaluates the impact of three types of reminder letters on the rate at which land is offered into the CRP. We find that for the most well-informed group, farms with expiring CRP contracts, the reminder letters did improve participation. We interpret this result as evidence of inattentive behavior. We do not detect any differences in the estimated treatment effects among the basic reminder letter and the letters augmented with peer comparisons and social norm messaging, nor do we detect any treatment effect among currently unenrolled farms. From a policy perspective, these results imply that the USDA can generate additional CRP offers among farms with expiring contracts at an average cost of $ 39 per additional offer. Assuming a twenty-five million acre program, reminder letters sent during every sign-up period would result in re-enrollment offers from an additional 420,000 acres. Using simulations based on offers from prior CRP sign-ups, we estimate that these additional offers in the CRP auction would reduce program costs. Depending on the year of simulation, the outreach effort achieves a benefit-cost ratio of between 20: 1 and 90: 1.","[Wallander, Steven] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Ferraro, Paul] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Higgins, Nathaniel] Off Evaluat Sci, Social & Behav Sci Team, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Johns Hopkins University,"Wallander, S (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",swallander@ers.usda.gov,"Ferraro, Paul/B-4435-2014","Ferraro, Paul/0000-0002-4777-5108",,,,,30,37,40,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

There has been little work conducted in Australia that has modelled farm exit or exit intention. ABARES farm survey data were used to model irrigators' farm exit intentions across the southern MDB from 2006 to 2013. In particular, we examined the hypotheses that drought and water scarcity positively impacted on farm exit intentions and that it is the poorest performing farms that intend to exit in times of drought. Results revealed that water scarcity impacts varied considerably. There was only weak evidence to suggest that irrigators' exit intentions were higher in times of drought, but there was stronger evidence to support the influence of a lagged water scarcity impact on farm exit intentions during periods of nondrought (e.g. intending to exit at times when the property market was less depressed). There was also strong evidence that poorer performing farms (measured by rates of return and higher debt over a certain level) were more likely to have exit intentions in drought periods, but not necessarily so in nondrought periods. Older age is the most consistent predictor of farm exit intentions across all industries, though it was most significant in drought periods.","[Wheeler, Sarah Ann; Zuo, Alec] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Wheeler, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",sarah.wheeler@adelaide.edu.au,"Wheeler, Sarah Ann/H-4000-2017; Zuo, Alec/AAU-3394-2020","Wheeler, Sarah Ann/0000-0002-6073-3172; Zuo, Alec/0000-0003-0425-4633","Australian Research Council (ARC) [FT140100773, DP140103946]",Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),"The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of two reviewers and Lin Crase that improved this manuscript and are grateful to ABARES (especially Mihir Gupta, Neal Hughes, Tim Goesch and Peter Gooday) for providing data access and support.

These include explicit government subsidies with an average premium subsidy rate of about 60% in recent years, and the legislative requirement that premium rates be set at actuarially fair levels, where the federal government sets rates and pays all costs related to insurance policy sales and services. Bearing these features in mind, we examine the extent to which farmers' crop insurance choices conform to economic theory. A standard expected utility maximization framework is constructed to analyze trade-offs between higher risk protection and larger subsidy payments. We decompose the effect of coverage level on expected utility into insurance, premium loading, and subsidy transfer effects where the loading effect vanishes if rates are actuarially fair. Given an actuarially fair premium, we infer that a rational farmer should choose either the coverage level with the highest premium subsidy or a higher coverage level. Evidence from a large insurance unit-level data-set contradicts this theoretical inference, and so suggests anomalous insurance decisions. In a novel application of the mixed logit framework, we show that the probability an insurance product is chosen declines as out-of-pocket premium expenditures increase, even though higher values of these expenditures should reflect improved grower welfare. Premium expenditures appear to be more salient than the uncertain future benefits they support. We apply our regression to the recent trend yield adjustment innovation in crop insurance.","[Du, Xiaodong] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Feng, Hongli] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Food & Agr Policy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Feng, Hongli; Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Iowa State University,"Du, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",xdu23@wisc.edu,"Feng, Hongli/A-1662-2013","Feng, Hongli/0000-0001-7553-8145",,,,,52,67,83,6,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Using detailed bilateral tariff and trade data between 1996 and 2006, the results suggest that while U.S. tariff reductions provide a small but statistically significant increase on the probability of maintaining existing trade relationships, the magnitude of the impact on new exports is twice as large as the impact on continuously traded goods and the likelihood of disappearing products.

For the empirical model, on-site Poisson model was performed to correct truncated and endogenous stratification issues from on-site surveys. The results show that the estimated average consumer surplus is greater in contingent behavior method than the one in the traditional travel cost model. Also, the estimated recreational benefits in contingent behavior method are more precise than those in the traditional travel cost method. The environment benefits to consumers are communicated with the programs that changes in environment quality. Meanwhile, the incremental economic benefits comprise the gain associated with the improvement of environmental quality.","[Huang, Chin-Huang] Natl Taiwan Univ Sport, Dept Sport Management, Shuang Shih Rd, Taichung, Taiwan",National Taiwan University of Sport,"Huang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ Sport, Dept Sport Management, Shuang Shih Rd, Taichung, Taiwan.",hch55@ntupes.edu.tw,,,,,,,54,7,7,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors, first, theoretically discuss the effects of changing relative input prices due to rising labor cost on producers' decisions regarding input mix (substitution effect), output level, and product quality (output effect). A logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method is then applied to empirically identify these effects at aggregated levels, followed by an analysis based on the visualization of land use indicators on changing cropping patterns across Chinese provinces. Findings - The authors find that tightened effective agricultural labor supply and rises in rural labor costs are associated with divergent changes in input mixes and output choices across products. Producers of land-intensive products focusing more on input mix adjustment, while those of labor-intensive products seem to more likely to adjust output choices. Producers' adaption strategies also varied across Chinese provinces due to natural conditions, leading to shifts and concentrations in the regional distribution of agricultural products, with lower-value bulk products concentrating in the plain areas, whereas higher-value horticulture products increasingly prevailing in sloped areas. Originality/value - This paper illustrates how adjustments in input mixes and output choice in Chinese agriculture counteracted disadvantages caused by rising labor costs and how such adjustments are product and region specific. Based on these observations, implications regarding further innovations in production technology and institutional arrangements needed within China's agricultural sector are highlighted in the paper.","[Li, Tianxiang; Zhu, Jing; Ji, Yueqing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wusheng] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Zhu, Jing; Ji, Yueqing] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Copenhagen; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Zhu, J (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zhu, J (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",crystalzhu@njau.edu.cn,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015; Yu, Wusheng/E-4626-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711; Yu, Wusheng/0000-0002-2311-3759","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; University of Copenhagen; PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; China Center for Food Security Studies; Jiangsu Center for Food Security Studies; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SKCX2017002]; NSFC of China [7167031193, 71773051]",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); University of Copenhagen; PAPD of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; China Center for Food Security Studies; Jiangsu Center for Food Security Studies; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); NSFC of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The first author acknowledges financial support from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.

While there are a number of studies on this topic, they frame moral hazard in inputs use in a static model. However, when agricultural producers are forward-looking, they would make input allocation decisions realizing that their decisions would affect their future actual production history. This, in turn, affects the probability and size of future indemnity payments. Thus, moral hazard should be framed in a dynamic input use decision model. We first show theoretically that under certain feasible conditions, a static analysis always results in lower optimal input use when compared to a dynamic one with endogenous actual production history. This is because static models fail to recognize the role of actual production history. We then run numerical simulations using nitrogen application rates as a case study. We find that static models indicate significant reduction in nitrogen use compared to the no-insurance scenario, whereas the dynamic models with a role for actual production history indicate almost no reduction in applied nitrogen. The dynamic analysis not only suggests a near absence of moral hazard, but, for low coverage rates, it results in an optimal nitrogen rate higher than that under the no-insurance scenario. These findings illustrate the importance of recognizing the role of actual production history in mitigating moral hazard possibilities in crop insurance and the dynamic nature of moral hazard in crop insurance.","[Mieno, Taro; Walters, Cory G.; Fulginiti, Lilyan E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Mieno, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",tmieno2@unl.edu,,"Mieno, Taro/0000-0002-0614-0771","Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NEB-24-182, NEB-24-183, W4133]; Nebraska Research Initiative",Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Nebraska Research Initiative,"This work was supported by the Agricultural Research Division at the University of Nebraska, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch projects NEB-24-182 and NEB-24-183, and Multi-state Hatch project W4133.

We argue that this is a useful way of generating highly-detailed spatial maps of willingness to pay for environmental conservation, given the costs of collecting data. The data used in this study come from a discrete choice experiment survey of public preferences for the implementation of a new national forest management and protection programme in Poland. We combine these with high-resolution spatial data related to local forest characteristics. Using locally estimated discrete choice models we obtain location-specific estimates of willingness to pay (WTP). Variation in these estimates is explained by characteristics of the forests close to where respondents live. These results are compared with those obtained from a more typical, two stage procedure which uses Bayesian posterior means of the mixed logit model random parameters to calculate location-specific estimates of WTP. We find that there are indeed strong spatial patterns to the benefits of changes to the management to national forests. People living in areas with more species-rich forests and those living nearer bigger areas of mixed forests have significantly different WTP values than those living in other locations. This kind of information potentially enables a better distributional analysis of the gains and losses from changes to natural resource management, and better targeting of investments in forest quality.","[Budzinski, Wiktor; Czajkowski, Mikolaj] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Econ Div, Stirling, Scotland; [Demsar, Urska; Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of Warsaw; University of Stirling; University of St Andrews,"Czajkowski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",mc@uw.edu.pl,"Czajkowski, Mikołaj/K-2292-2012; Budziński, Wiktor/ABA-3433-2020; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Czajkowski, Mikołaj/0000-0001-5118-2308; Budziński, Wiktor/0000-0001-9866-4267; Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318",EEA Financial Mechanism [PL0257]; Norwegian Financial Mechanism [PL0257]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; National Science Centre of Poland [2015/19/D/HS4/01972]; Foundation for Polish Science (FNP),"EEA Financial Mechanism; Norwegian Financial Mechanism; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); National Science Centre of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Foundation for Polish Science (FNP)(Foundation for Polish Science)","Danny Campbell is in the Economics Division of Stirling Management School, University of Stirling, UK.

One major pathway by which climatic variability is hypothesized to increase conflict is by decreasing food availability. However, limitations on food access at both the local and national levels in many developing African countries force most armed groups and communities to depend on locally-produced food. These actors are therefore likely to use violence to establish control over more food resources or be stationed where more food is available, suggesting that food abundance might also be driving conflict. The present study employs novel data on wheat and maize yields in Africa measured at the very local level to empirically evaluate this hypothesis on a highly disaggregated conflict indicator. To account for the endogenous relationship between conflict and food production, average local levels of drought are used as an instrument. The findings show that, contrary to previous expectations, conflict is driven by higher yields, on average, and not by scarcity.","[Koren, Ore] Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Koren, Ore] Dartmouth Coll, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Dartmouth College,"Koren, O (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Koren, O (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dickey Ctr Int Understanding, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",ore.koren@dartmouth.edu,,,Jennings Randolph Peace Scholar Award from the United States Institute of Peace,Jennings Randolph Peace Scholar Award from the United States Institute of Peace,"Ore Koren is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, and a U.S. Foreign Policy and International Security Fellow at the Dickey Center for International Understanding, Dartmouth College.

We study consumer preferences for rye bread alternatives based on transgenic or cisgenic rye, grown conventionally or without the use of pesticides, relative to traditionally bred rye, grown with conventional or organic farming methods. Stated preference (SP) data from a choice experiment are combined with revealed preference (RP) data from market purchases from the same respondents. Results show that respondents prefer pesticide-free production methods, and that while cisgenics is preferred over transgenics, the majority of respondents favour traditional breeding methods. The distribution in preferences suggests that some respondents prefer bread from cisgenic crops produced without pesticides over traditional crops produced using pesticides. Preferences for organic bread are stronger than for pesticide-free products. From a policy perspective results suggest that excluding cisgenics from mandatory labeling in the EU, or including it in the voluntary non-GM labelling in the US, would cause welfare losses for consumers.","[Edenbrandt, Anna K.; Gamborg, Christian; Thorsen, Bo J.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Thorsen, Bo J.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Edenbrandt, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ake@ifro.ku.dk,"Nummer2, CMEC/HKE-1900-2023; Gamborg, Christian/AAC-2075-2019; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014; Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina/E-5213-2015","Gamborg, Christian/0000-0003-3150-8280; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343; Edenbrandt, Anna Kristina/0000-0002-9298-6705",University of Copenhagen; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF96],University of Copenhagen; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),The authors acknowledge funding from the University of Copenhagen for the KU2016 Plants for a Changing World project.

In addition to mitigating the pollution externality of conventional energy, clean energy mandates have the goal of promoting research and development (R&D) investments in renewable energy technology. But how well do mandates perform as innovation incentives? To address this question, we develop a partial equilibrium model to examine the R&D incentives induced by a mandate, and compare this policy to two benchmark situations: laissez faire and a carbon tax. Innovation is stochastic and the model permits an endogenous number of multiple innovators. We present both analytical results and conclusions based on numerical simulations. We find that the optimal mandate is larger than it would be without the prospect of innovation, that neglecting the outlook for innovation significantly reduces welfare, and that the optimal mandate is more sensitive to assumptions about the innovation process than an optimal carbon tax. Furthermore, we find that mandates create relatively strong incentives for R&D investment in low-quality innovations, but relatively weak incentives to invest in high-quality innovations. We also rank policies by expected welfare. An optimal carbon tax has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate, and both have higher expected welfare than laissez faire. Moreover, in our endogenous innovation setting, a stronger result obtains: a simple carbon tax equal to the damage from pollution (unadjusted for the prospect of innovation) has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate.","[Clancy, Matthew S.] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Clancy, MS (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",matthew.clancy@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,36,11,15,2,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Design/methodology/approach Data used in this study are based on a discrete choice experiment from 552 randomly selected respondents. Mixed logit and latent class models are estimated to examine the choice probability and sources of preference heterogeneity. Endogenous attribute attendance models are applied to account for attribute non-attendance (ANA) phenomenon, focusing on separate non-attendance probability as well as joint non-attendance probability. Findings The results demonstrate that preference heterogeneity and ANA exist in the smallholder farmers' microcredit choices. Averagely, smallholder farmers prefer longer credit period, smaller credit size, lower transaction costs and lower interest rate. Guarantor collateral method and installment repayment positively affect their preferences as well. Moreover, respondents are found to be willing to pay more for the attributes they consider important. The microcredit providers are able to attract new customers under the current interest rates, if the combination of attributes is appropriately adjusted. Originality/value This study contributes to the debate by assessing the preference trade-off of different microcredit attributes more comprehensively than in previous analyses, by taking preference heterogeneity and ANA into account.","[Ding, Zhao; Abdulai, Awudu] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,55,9,9,4,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach The paper synthesizes research findings from previous studies and reviews more recent trends. Based on the main findings, the authors provide forward-looking guidance for China's investments agriculture and rural areas in the context of emerging global and domestic trends in agriculture, food security, and nutrition. Findings Public investments in the agricultural research and development (R&D), rural education, and rural infrastructure have been shown to have significant positive returns to agricultural growth as well as to reductions in poverty and regional inequality. Returns to overall agricultural GDP were highest for agricultural R&D, followed by education, roads, and telephones. Investment in education had the greatest returns to poverty reduction, as well as to nonfarm GDP and overall rural GDP. Investment in agricultural R&D had the second greatest returns in term of poverty reduction, and was also a close second in returns to nonfarm GDP and overall rural GDP following education. The rural infrastructure spending also saw significant returns to poverty reduction, largely through growth in agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. Investments in agriculture and rural areas will continue to be important, as China and the world face emerging challenges amidst a changing global landscape, particularly regarding climate change, rapid urbanization, nutritional imbalances, and food safety concerns. In addressing these emerging challenges, continued support for agricultural R&D and innovations can play a key role. Originality/value The paper highlights research findings on key investment areas that will be increasingly important for China's agri-food system, and provides guidance in the context of emerging trends impacting food security and nutrition.","[Fan, Shenggen; Cho, Emily EunYoung; Rue, Christopher] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Fan, SG (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",s.fan@cgiar.org,,"Cho, Emily/0000-0002-7499-6619",,,,,23,11,14,8,73,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In this article, I examine the farmland value consequences of relaxing a particularly stringent farmland ownership restriction in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was introduced in 1974 and prohibited non-Saskatchewan residents and corporations from owning Saskatchewan farmland. In 2003, the act was amended to allow Canadian residents and Canadian corporations to acquire farmland, bringing Saskatchewan in line with neighboring provinces and states that restrict foreign ownership but are open to domestic ownership. I estimate the impact of the 2003 amendment on Saskatchewan farmland values using 1995 through 2010 parcel-level farmland transactions in Saskatchewan and its neighboring province of Manitoba. The impact of the 2003 amendment is assessed in a series of econometric models that use differential trends in farmland prices in the two provinces before and after the amendment. I find that the 2003 amendment led to a 1.9% to 3.1% per year increase in Saskatchewan farmland values.","[Lawley, Chad] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Lawley, C (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",chad.lawley@umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,63,9,10,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We estimate welfare gains resulting from optimal management under uncertainty as well as a gradual stock externality that produces the dynamics of a large aquifer being slowly exhausted. This groundwater model imposes an important aspect of a depletable natural resource without the extreme assumption of complete exhaustion that is necessary in a traditional single cell (bathtub) model of groundwater extraction. Using dynamic programming, we incorporate and compare stochasticity for both an independent and identically distributed as well as a Markov chain process for annual rainfall. We find that the spatial depletion of the aquifer is significant to welfare gains for a parameterization of a section of the Ogallala Aquifer in Kansas, ranging from 2.9% to 3.01%, which is larger than those found previously over the region. Surprisingly, the inclusion of stochasticity in rainfall increases welfare gains only slightly.","[Merrill, Nathaniel H.] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Guilfoos, Todd] Univ Rhode Isl, Environm & Nat Resource Econ Dept, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Rhode Island,"Merrill, NH (通讯作者)，US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",merrill.nathaniel@epa.gov,,,"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; ORD [ORD-015498]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1005053]; NIFA [811931, 1005053] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); ORD; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Although the information in this document has been funded in part by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it does not necessarily reflect the views of that agency, and no official endorsement should be inferred.

No evidence emerges to indicate any impact of the measures on farm income, employment or partial productivities. Conversely, participation in the selected policy schemes resulted initially in a productivity increase and, subsequently, in enhanced farm performance. We argue that participation in the growth-oriented measures gave rise to a process of capital deepening that, in turn, elicited a productivity increase and, eventually, positive growth rates in farm performance.

These costs need to be considered when assessing control options and developing public policy. We investigate the preferences and willingness to pay of the UK general public for a range of forest disease control measures using a choice experiment with a sample of 605 people. Respondents were relatively well informed about general tree disease-related issues, such as causes and general measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. They were less knowledgeable about specific tree diseases, with Dutch elm disease and chalara ash dieback being the most well known. We find that disease control programmes in publicly-owned forests and forests owned by charitable trusts are more likely to be supported by the public than equivalent control programmes in privately-owned and/or commercial forests. The nature of scientific uncertainty about diseases does not affect peoples' preferences for disease control measures significantly. Higher respondent income, greater ex-ante knowledge about tree diseases, and more frequent visits to forests are correlated with greater willingness to support publicly-funded tree disease control programmes in forests. Better knowledge about tree diseases also improves the clarity of respondents' choices. We find a negative sentiment against some disease control measures, such as clear felling of a forest, and chemical or biocide spraying. We conclude that there is significant public support for part-financing forest disease control policies in the UK, but that this is conditional on forest ownership and the type of control measures used.","[Sheremet, Oleg; Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Healey, John R.] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Quine, Christopher P.] Ctr Ecosyst Soc & Biosecur, Forest Res, Roslin, Midlothian, Scotland",University of St Andrews; Bangor University,"Hanley, N (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Healey, John R/J-3719-2016","Healey, John R/0000-0002-5398-2293; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499","BBSRC; Defra; ESRC; Forestry Commission; NERC; Scottish Government; BBSRC [BB/L012359/1, BB/L012561/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L012359/1, BB/L012561/1] Funding Source: researchfish","BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Forestry Commission; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Scottish Government; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","This work is from a project titled 'Modelling economic impact and strategies to increase resilience against tree disease outbreaks'.

The conceptual linkage between IMV adoption and child nutrition is first established using an agricultural household model. Instrumental variable estimation suggests the overall impacts of adoption on child height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores to be positive and significant. Quantile instrumental variable regressions further reveal that such impacts are largest among children with poorest nutrition outcomes. Finally, by combining a decomposition procedure with system of equations estimation, it is found that the increase in own-produced maize consumption is the major channel through which IMV adoption affects child nutrition.","[Zeng, Di] Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, 5-24 Nexus 10, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Alwang, Jeffrey; Norton, George W.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 215I Hutcheson Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Shiferaw, Bekele] World Bank Grp, IEG Sustainable Dev Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Jaleta, Moti] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, POB 5689, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Yirga, Chilot] EIAR, POB 2003, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Adelaide; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; The World Bank; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR),"Zeng, D (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Ctr Global Food & Resources, 5-24 Nexus 10, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",di.zeng@adelaide.edu.au,"Alwang, Jeffrey/AAA-1716-2020; Zeng, Di/O-8947-2019","Zeng, Di/0000-0001-6403-5606; Shiferaw, Bekele/0000-0002-3645-320X; Alwang, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2950-8516",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This study is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the project of Diffusion and Impact of Improved Varieties in Africa (DIIVA) led by the CGIAR Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA).

However, it is unclear to what extent the public is willing to trade-off fair working conditions for higher prices. We implement a large-scale survey in Greece to uncover consumer preferences for a food labelling system that certifies fair working conditions for the workers employed in agricultural production. With our most conservative estimates, we find that consumers are willing to pay an average premium of 53 cents of a Euro per 500 g, 95 per cent CI [43.9, 62.3], for strawberries with fair labour certification. This result suggests that consumers do value the better treatment of workers in the agricultural sector. It also suggests that there is a current market failure, created by the asymmetry of information between consumers and producers, that can be the basis of discussion for alternative labelling schemes involving fair labour labels. We also tested a number of known biases associated with consumer behaviour or the contingent valuation method and found the positive willingness-to-pay result to be robust.","[Drichoutis, Andreas C.; Vassilopoulos, Achilleas] Agr Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Vassilopoulos, Achilleas] ICRE8 Int Ctr Res Environm & Econ, Athens, Greece; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Oslo, Norway; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Agricultural University of Athens; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Korea University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Drichoutis, AC (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Athens, Athens, Greece.",adrihout@aua.gr,"Drichoutis, Andreas/AAM-6580-2020","Drichoutis, Andreas/0000-0002-4082-4560",John S.

Market power considerations are also addressed where one region has a competitive advantage in production. While consumers buy local for a variety of reasons, our model categorizes some of the motivations and analyzes the impacts on output under various market structures. Welfare is calculated when demand is changed due to subsidies or taxes. We also allow for the presence of externalities. We find that, in the absence of market power or externalities, deadweight losses occur when the region without a competitive advantage buys more locally. However, in the presence of significant externalities and in the presence of market power, it is possible that profits to producers from consumers buying local could increase more than consumer utility is harmed, thus increasing aggregate social welfare. This could arise if consumers genuinely feel there are sufficient positive externalities from local production or negative externalities from non-local production to warrant the loss of efficiency. We point out that understanding the motivation behind the movement is critical when analyzing welfare effects since some motivations are counter-productive to each other.","[Winfree, Jason; Watson, Philip] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Winfree, J (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",jwinfree@uidaho.edu,"Watson, Philip/AAW-7523-2020; Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020","Watson, Philip/0000-0002-0540-2370;",Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Jason Winfree and Philip Watson are both associate professors at the University of Idaho.

Despite their prevalence, the literature surrounding the effectiveness of this class of productive asset intervention is only starting to emerge. In this paper, we examine an NGO-sponsored goat transfer-and-training program in rural Haiti. Before realizing the ultimate program goals of improved health, greater levels of education, better housing, and more productive farms, beneficiaries must build sustainable herds of healthy goats. Our intent is to identify household characteristics correlated with success in the program. Therefore, we measure a set of outcomes related to herd health and growth, and explain their variation across beneficiaries by regressing them on a set of household variables. We use the results of the regressions to evaluate hypotheses informed by current literature in asset-based poverty. Specifically, we find compelling evidence that the wealthiest beneficiaries build smaller, less valuable herds compared to poorer beneficiaries. We find equally compelling evidence that geography affects herd growth. In addition, we find that access to land significantly reduces kid mortality, a key to sustainable, profitable goat herding. Finally, we find some evidence that female beneficiaries experience lower kid mortality. To the extent that these findings hold in other contexts, NGOs can improve the targeting of livestock programs by screening beneficiaries on these criteria.","[Thompson, William M.; Magnan, Nicholas] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Thompson, WM (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",willt78@uga.edu,,,,,,,19,3,3,2,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We test our hypothesis using data from a natural experiment conducted by Relay Foods, an online retailer based in the U.S. state of Virginia, and a multi-variate logit model of shopping-basket demand. We find significant complementarities among items in a sample shopping basket that are not reflected in estimates from a discrete-choice model of category demand.

Design/methodology/approach - This study examines the nature and extent of the profitability and profit efficiency of custom and self-farming based on a farm survey in Taiwan. Furthermore, it estimates the stochastic profit frontier to measure the degree of inefficiency and analyze the determinants of these inefficiencies. Findings - The profitability and profit efficiency of custom farming are lower than for self-farming, and the differences in profitability are more significant for large rice farmers. The estimation results show that the custom farming area and the farmer's age decrease efficiency and, regardless of the farming style used, larger farms have higher profit efficiency. Research limitations/implications - This study's findings show that self-farming is more favorable than custom farming for profit efficiency. This study examined this problem by conducting a regression adjustment for explanatory variables, but did not remove all self-selection bias, which may occur between profit efficiency and the choice of farming system. Originality/value - Previous studies that measured the efficiency of rice farming often considered cost efficiency by the cost function, and ignored the increased profit from producing high-quality rice. This study used a one-step estimation of the profit frontier function to measure the degree of inefficiency and analyze the determinants of this inefficiency.","[Chang, Tsaiyu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Takahashi, Daisuke] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Yang, Chih-Kuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",University of Tokyo; Waseda University; National Taiwan University,"Chang, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Chang, Tsaiyu/AAI-9843-2021","Chang, Tsaiyu/0000-0003-1515-1293; Takahashi, Daisuke/0000-0001-7105-4047",JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K18762]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K18762] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16K18762.,,26,7,8,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Changes are calculated in the real terms using the detailed input-output matrices for representative farms in Poland, for different economic size classes, in the years 2007-2013. Input-output matrices were used for the decomposition of the Hicks-Moorsteen TFP index. The goal is to evaluate changes in the real TFP in the downturn and recovery phases of the business cycle in agriculture. It was found that the reaction of TFP to business cycle changes on small, medium and even large family farms in Poland is diametrically opposite to that observed in the case of large-scale farms. More than 90% of farms in Poland (except for the largest) increase technical productivity in the conditions of the economic downturn and lower it in the conditions of the economic recovery. Such behaviour is pro-cyclic and irrational, alluding to the 17th-century King's effect, which is vanishing in the agricultural systems of highly developed countries. The hypothesis is proposed that the size of the price expectation error which causes that effect is negatively correlated with the economic size of the farm, but at the same time it is proportional to the percentage of agricultural income obtained from subsidies and other payments under the SAPS system.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli; Majchrzak, Adam] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",b.czyzewski@ue.poznan.pl,"Majchrzak, Adam/JEO-9607-2023; Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Majchrzak, Adam/0000-0001-6486-0585; Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723","National Science Centre in Poland [OPUS 6 UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/00572, 51104-84]","National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","Supported by the National Science Centre in Poland allocated on the basis of the decision: OPUS 6 UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/00572, No. 51104-84 Political rents in the European Union's agriculture - comparative analysis basing on the UE27.",,25,11,11,1,28,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

A further research is thus required both in relation to the period since the decoupling reform, and in relation to the new member countries in the EU 28. In the paper, it is suggested that the productivity of resources in agriculture is not affected by the total amounts of subsidies, but by their structure. A three-stage spatial analysis was made of an EUFADN representative sample in the years 2007-2012: in the first stage, clusters of regions with significantly different agricultural support models were identified; in the second, it was determined whether the structure of the political rent, reflecting the different support models in the EU 28, is a signifi cant determinant of the productivity of capital, land and labour on farms when subsidies are excluded and when they are included in the analysis. In the third stage, a robust model has been estimated (employing GLS) to relate the factors productivity to the EUFADN subsidies and to the location variables identified by the cluster analysis. The analysis confirmed that the qualitative predictor, i.e. a structure of agricultural support, was a signifi cant factor influencing the capital productivity over the whole of the period.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli; Smedzik-Ambrozy, Katarzyna] Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Smedzik-Ambrozy, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Poznan, Poland.",k.smedzik@poczta.fm,"Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723; Smedzik-Ambrozy, Katarzyna/0000-0001-5228-2263",,,,,40,18,18,2,26,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Nonetheless, despite the value of the short supply chains, some researchers have reacted sceptically to the irrational optimism around this sales structure. A close relationship with consumers does not imply more profit or exchange fairness by definition. In fact, increasing marketing costs must be considered and there is still information asymmetry, and the profiteering farmers could take advantage of the consumer trust. Through data reduction we explored the farmers' motivation and perceived effects of participating in short food supply chains. We also analysed the location of farms along with their size, production, sale channels and the relative market share, as well as whether they adopted quality certifications. We found that the farmers that work within the short food supply chains opt for a sort of co-certification mechanism based on the consumer/producer relationships rather than opting for the quality certification. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed different motivations and perceptions of direct sales among farmers: those that were the largest and farthest from the point of sale, were positive toward the social values of short food supply chains, while the rest seemed less competitive and were more motivated by profit and survival. The results reaffirm that the local production may not be good per se, and the presence of profit and surviving-orientation to market should be considered a treat especially for the reputation of the whole system.","[Demartini, Eugenio; Gaviglio, Anna; Pirani, Alberto] Univ Milan, Dept Hlth Anim Sci & Food Safety VESPA, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Demartini, E (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Hlth Anim Sci & Food Safety VESPA, Milan, Italy.",eugenio.demartini@unimi.it,"Demartini, Eugenio/H-2235-2014","Demartini, Eugenio/0000-0002-6733-9098",Fondazione Cariplo; Parco Agricolo Sud Milano,Fondazione Cariplo(Fondazione Cariplo); Parco Agricolo Sud Milano,The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support from the Fondazione Cariplo and Parco Agricolo Sud Milano for the project Osservatorio economico-ambientale per l'innovazione del Parco Agricolo Sud Milano.,,62,37,37,7,51,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

By the means of cluster analysis and the graphic design of friendship, the kinship, the compadrazgo knowledge, the collaboration and cooperation networks, we concluded that the structural activation must transcend the formal creation of an organization. It is best to value and then mobilize the pre-existing social capital in a territory with a specific traditional know-how as a foundation to the structure and activation process of the LAS. Four actors were identified for their active participation in all analysed networks; these were the information diffusers and network structures.

These include public sector agricultural research and development (R&D), public sector biotechnology research and innovation, subsidies for commercial research, encouraging foreign firms to invest in China as minority shareholders in joint ventures, and allowing commercial companies to raise money on the stock market. The purpose of this paper is to assess whether these policies were effective in stimulating innovations by commercial firms in China. Design/methodology/approach - This study estimates the impact of public biotech research and other policies by employing an econometric model of patenting by commercial firms. It uses a unique data set collected from commercial agribusiness firms for the years 2001, 2004, 2005, and 2006. Addition data were collected from public research institutes and universities and patent data from the Derwent Innovations Index database. It employs four count data models for the empirical analysis. Findings - This study finds a positive impact of public biotechnology (measured by the number of biotech patents of government research institutes and public universities) on commercial innovation measured by the number of patents granted to the commercial firms. As expected the firm's research expenditure and having their own R&D center (as opposed to contracting R&D or no R&D investment at all) have a positive and statistically significant effect on the number of patents granted. The impacts of public R&D investment spending have no statistically significant effect on commercial innovation. Multi-national firms and publicly traded firms have fewer patents than their counterparts suggesting that policies to encourage multi-nationals and financing through stock markets had no impact on innovation. Originality/value - This study is one of the first studies to untangle the relationship between government policies and innovation by commercial agricultural research output and public R&D investment and biotechnology. The main findings suggest that simply increasing research money to public research does not increase commercial innovations, but moving resources to the development patentable biotech does improve commercial research productivity. The results also suggest that policies to increase commercial research will also increase innovation. These could include strengthening the legal framework and institutional resources for public institutes to the protection and enforcement of intellectual properties.","[Jin, Yanhong; Hu, Yahong; Pray, Carl] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Hu, Ruifa] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Jin, YH (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",Yanhong.Jin@rutgers.edu,,,China's National Social Science Foundation [71210004],China's National Social Science Foundation,"The authors also need to acknowledge the funding support from China's National Social Science Foundation, Project No. 71210004.",,40,5,6,4,76,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Current understanding of the impact of climate change on this sector relies on the underlying assumptions about farmers' possible responses to weather variability, including changes in crop choice, input combinations and land management practices. Many previous analyses rely on the implicit (and restrictive) assumption that farmers operate under a fixed technology set across different states of nature. This assumption, represented through stochastic production or profit functions, is commonly made but seldom tested and may understate farmers' responses to climate change if state-contingent production technologies are, in reality, more flexible. The potential for farmers to adapt production technologies in response to unforeseen events is at the core of the state-contingent approach. Advanced in Chambers and Quiggin (2000), the theory contends that producers can manage uncertainty through the allocation of productive inputs to different states of nature. In this article, we test the assumption that farmers' observed behaviour is consistent with the state-contingent production theory using farm-level data from Australia. More precisely, we estimate the milk production technology for a sample of irrigated dairy farms from the southern Murray-Darling Basin over the period from 2006-2007 to 2009-2010.","[Sanders, Orion] ABARES, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Mallawaarachchi, Thilak; Quiggin, John] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Nauges, Celine] Univ Toulouse Capitole, INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",University of Queensland; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Quiggin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",j.quiggin@uq.edu.au,"Mallawaarachchi, Thilak/M-1840-2013; Quiggin, John/C-1621-2013","Quiggin, John/0000-0003-0398-8280",Australian Research Council [FT100100708]; ARC Laureate Fellowship; Australian Research Council [FT100100708] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); ARC Laureate Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Earlier versions of this article were presented at the 57th Annual Conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society, 5-7 February 2013, Sydney, Australia, and the 20th Annual Conference of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, 26-30 June 2013, Toulouse, France.

Findings - Simulation results indicate that climate change-induced seasonal drought and the resulting yield reduction will incur substantial losses to China's grain production (by similar to 8 percent at a national scale). The application of water saving techniques can be an effective solution to seasonal drought. Introducing new varieties will increase the combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption will increase combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption constitute an effective approach to offsetting the negative effects of climate change on grain production. Research limitations/implications - Simulation results indicate that climate change-induced seasonal drought and the resulting sown area reduction will incur substantial losses to China's grain production by approximately 8 percent, despite farmers' adaptation activities of switching from water use-intensive crops to drought-tolerant crops to mitigate this negative effect. The application of water saving techniques is an effective solution to seasonal drought; it can lead to a nationwide increase in the sown area by 3.48 percent and in the grain production by 4.15 percent. Introducing new varieties will increase grain outputs and change the spatial distribution of crop production across the country. The combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption will increase the national grain production by 19.6 percent, and thus constitute an effective approach to offsetting the negative effects of climate change on grain production. Originality/value - Results from this study provide practical implications formulate strategies in response to climate change. Central government should reinforce the policies such as new varieties promotion and improve the subsidy method to guide the introduction of new varieties.","[Zhou, Shudong; Zhou, Wenkui; Lin, Guanghua] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shudong] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jing; Jiang, Tong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog & Remote Sensing, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tong] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Man] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Li, M (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Environm & Prod Technol Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Man.Li@cgiar.org,"wang, jun/JPY-3635-2023",,"Key Project of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD160]; Soft science project of Ministry of Agriculture of China [L201015]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [XNC2012001]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","Key Project of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China; Soft science project of Ministry of Agriculture of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","This study was conducted under the Key Project of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (13&ZD160), China Agricultural Research System (CARS-13), the Soft science project of Ministry of Agriculture of China (L201015), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71573135), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (XNC2012001), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), and China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University.

A split sample single-site design was used to estimate values for the Kimberley region as a whole, and for two separate smaller sub-regions, allowing us to test for spatial preference heterogeneity. Management outcomes for different regions were displayed on a map to show respondents explicitly where outcomes would occur. We show that willingness to pay results are similar between the two smaller sub-regions, and that willingness to pay for the attributes increased when management occurred at the larger geographical scale. However, respondents were somewhat insensitive to changes in the scope of the two cardinal attributes: area of no-take and number of rangers.

Using a newly expanded compilation of multifactor productivity (MFP) estimates and associated partial-factor productivity (PFP) measures, we examine changes in the pattern of U.S. agricultural productivity growth over the past century and more. Considering the evidence as a whole, we detect sizable and significant slowdowns in the rate of productivity growth in recent decades. U.S. multifactor productivity grew at an annual average rate of just 1.16% per year during 1990-2007 compared with 1.42% per year for the period 1910-2007. U.S. yields of major crops grew at an annual average rate of 1.17% per year for 1990-2009 compared with 1.81% per year for 1936-1990. More subtly, but with potentially profound implications, the relatively high rates of MFP growth during the third quarter of the century are an historical aberration relative to the long-run trend.","[Andersen, Matthew A.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Alston, Julian M.; Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Andersen, Matthew A.; Alston, Julian M.] InSTePP, Durham, NC 27707 USA; [Alston, Julian M.; Smith, Aaron] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA USA",University of Wyoming; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Andersen, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Andersen, MA (通讯作者)，InSTePP, Durham, NC 27707 USA.",mander60@uwyo.edu,,"Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341; Andersen, Matt/0000-0002-3937-8217","University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; University of California, Davis; University of Wyoming; USDA's Economic Research Service, Agricultural Research Service; CSREES National Research Initiative","University of Minnesota's International Science and Technology Practice and Policy (InSTePP) center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; University of California, Davis(University of California System); University of Wyoming; USDA's Economic Research Service, Agricultural Research Service; CSREES National Research Initiative(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Matthew Andersen is an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wyoming.

We developed a stochastic cost-benefit analysis model for two types of dairy herds (high yield Holstein-Zebu crossbred females and lower productivity smaller scale herds) to identify the technical and economic constraints of this process. The initial prevalence of infected animals and the impact of the disease in the structure and performance of the herd were derived from secondary data. Information on the costs and benefits of herd sanitation were compiled into a cost-benefit model at the herd level. The last step consisted of a scenario simulation to evaluate the impact of alternative policies to the certification process. For each scenario, we calculate the probability over time of a Benefit-Cost Ratio greater than 1 and of an Internal Rate of Return above 1% (the discount rate used in the model). Results show that larger and more intensive dairy farms, and also herds affected by brucellosis compared with tuberculosis-positive herds, are more likely to achieve financial gains from the certification investment. The compensation for culled animals is important in the initial phase of herd sanitation and the premium payment on milk would help farmers to achieve a return on the investment over time. The model can be adapted to different and dynamic production, epidemiological and economic settings.","[Freitas, Mariane Leao; Goncalves, Vitor S.

Its importance can be seen in the synergic links of three key areas: the crisis in the energy, the bio-waste and its processing as the most prospective opportunity of crisis solution, and the management in the form of tool for the final solution. The main aim of the scientific paper is based on the theoretical knowledge and study of trends in the field of the renewable energy sources to create a universal exemplary model of decision-making for mayors in the process of the bio-waste management in the municipal sector. The necessary data were obtained using the questionnaire form and the data processing was carried out in the statistical program PSPP method Chi-Square, T-test and correlation. The main finding is that the energy crisis is understood as a significant shortage of supply of energy sources to the economy. The results confirm that the utilization rate of the municipal bio-waste for energy purposes is very low. An exemplary model was divided into two main groups, communes and towns. For a more relevant animation, the communes and towns were divided into three sub-categories according to the population. Recommendations are made regarding the collection, processing and use of the bio-waste for each group.

A sample selection model is used to account for both unobserved heterogeneity and potential simultaneity between agricultural production and nonfarm income. Results show that nonfarm employment can have differential impacts on farm technology intensity and productivity. Nonfarm income is found to have a positive impact on farm hired labor and improved seed intensity; a negative effect on on-farm family labor use; and no significant impact on fertilizer, soil water management, and joint use of farm technologies. The econometric evidence also indicates that agricultural productivity declines as nonfarm income increases. Taken together, our findings reveal important trade-offs between nonfarm employment and income and farm productivity growth under smallholder agriculture.

By definition, these attributes signal asymmetric information which implies that in the presence of bounded rational individuals with conflicting interests, misconduct in the form of opportunistic behavior is bound to prevail. Increased information exchange through farmer networks is, however, expected to reduce opportunistic behavior. In the case of a differentiated meat product, such as Karoo Lamb, the article studies the farmer-abattoir transaction with the purpose of recommending strategies that can be implemented to reduce the farmer's tendency to behave opportunistically. The article employs the PLS approach to SEM and reveals a significant negative relationship between information shared and opportunistic behavior. The results indicate significant positive relationships between trust in the abattoir and information shared as well as between farmer networks and information shared. These results are indicative of the support provided to the information shared construct by higher levels of trust between farmers and abattoirs and established farmer networks. It is, therefore, recommended that differentiated meat supply chains, through their various associations, concentrate their efforts to promote information sharing by building stronger, trust centered relationships and by supporting farmer networks.","[van der Merwe, Melissa] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa; [Kirsten, Johann F.] Stellenbosch Univ, Bur Econ Res, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Trienekens, Jacques H.] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Dept Management Studies Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Pretoria; Stellenbosch University; Wageningen University & Research,"van der Merwe, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Pretoria, South Africa.",melissa.vandermerwe@up.ac.za,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023; van der Merwe, Melissa/J-9545-2019; Kirsten, Johann/AAC-8055-2019","van der Merwe, Melissa/0000-0002-2852-8419",Red Meat Research and Development SA; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Red Meat Research and Development SA; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Karoo farmers for their participation in the data collection process.

The model also allows the potential premium to vary by species. Results indicate that MSC premiums in Germany vary substantially between species, from a hefty 30.6 per cent for the high-end species cod, to a 4 per cent premium for Alaska pollock, and no premiums for saithe.","[Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Bronnmann, Julia] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Bronnmann, Julia] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger; University of Kiel; University of Kiel,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway.",Frank.Asche@ufl.edu,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020; Bronnmann, Julia/GPW-6997-2022","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Bronnmann, Julia/0000-0003-4149-7589",Norwegian Research Council [233751]; Research Project Systematische Verfahrensoptimierung der Edelfischaufzucht in rezirkulierenden Systemen 'Aqua-Edel' by Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Research Project Systematische Verfahrensoptimierung der Edelfischaufzucht in rezirkulierenden Systemen 'Aqua-Edel' by Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft und Ernahrung,We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

In so doing, we first show that the widely cited, extant measures of the quantity and value of food waste are inconsistent with one another and overstate the problem of food waste. By misdirecting and misallocating some of the resources that are currently put into food waste reduction efforts, this overstatement of the problem could have severe consequences for public policy. Our framework then allows documenting the points of intervention for policies aimed at reducing the extent of food waste in the life cycle of food and the identification of interdependencies between potential policy levers.","[Bellemare, Marc F.; Cakir, Metin; Peterson, Hikaru Hanawa] Univ Minnesota, Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Novak, Lindsey] Colby Coll, Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Rudi, Jeta] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Colby College; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",mbellema@umn.edu,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022",,,,,,22,179,202,3,102,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The impulse response analysis shows that the impact of the crisis on dynamic productivity growth is negative and persistent in the oils and fats industry, initially positive but then negative in the meat processing industry, and positive in the dairy processing industry. The observed magnitudes of change in indicator are between 2% and 5% for oils and fats industries, and of 1% in both dairy and meat industries.

The outcome of 'market orientation' is measured by considering both the change of the production mix and the investment decisions. In order to admit different responses across different support levels, the dose-response function is estimated adopting recent alternative continuous-treatment estimators. The application concerns the impact of the 2003/2005 EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform on the production choices within a balanced sample of Italian farms. Results confirm that farm response varies across support levels and show that the 2003/2005 reform of the first pillar of the CAP actually had a different, and somehow, opposite impact in reorienting farm production choices compared to investment decisions.","[Esposti, Roberto] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Esposti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy.",r.esposti@univpm.it,,,,,,,42,14,14,2,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Nevertheless, farmers are reluctant to invest in organic farming. Because nonmonetary aspects might be the reasons for this reluctance, this paper analyzes whether the farmers' investment behavior varies when given the option to invest in organic and conventional production methods. For this purpose, an incentivized experiment was conducted wherein conventional and organic hog farmers had the opportunity to consecutively invest in an organic and a conventional hog barn. Then, it was determined whether the farmers' investment timings differed between investments in the currently applied production method and the currently not-applied production method. These investment situations only differed in their description; the economic conditions were identical. The farmers' investment times in both production methods were compared to theoretically optimal investment times according to the real options approach (ROA). The results of the analysis show that a significant framing effect was associated with farmers' response to investment opportunities in organic and conventional hog barns. Farmers invested later if they invested in the currently not-applied production method. In these cases, the deviations between the ROA and the farmers' investment time were lower.","[Vollmer, Elisabeth; Hermann, Daniel; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Farm Management Grp, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Vollmer, E (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Farm Management Grp, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",elisabeth.vollmer@agr.uni-goettingen.de; daniel.hermann@agr.uni-goettingen.de; oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Hermann, Daniel/HNI-8466-2023","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hermann, Daniel/0000-0003-0023-3675",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We thank the two anonymous referees and the editor for helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Historically, this was not true. College committees acted only to uphold standards, ensure equity, and monitor procedural correctness within a department's evaluation process. Deans tended not to participate in routine faculty evaluations. Financial metrics like return on investment were not calculated on an individual faculty basis. Incentives from all administrative levels tended to be consistent with disciplinary success. These are no longer true for many agricultural economics departments. Both department and faculty responses have been mixed. At the department level, some have not responded while others have embraced a life science model. At the individual faculty level, some have not responded while others have chased money, impact factors, and publication counts. I explore the consequences of these changes for agricultural economists in a college dominated by life sciences with two caveats. First, this is an opinion article and represents my perceptions of general tendencies; there exist many exceptions in either direction. Second, I have biases which are undoubtedly reflected throughout.","[Ker, Alan P.] Univ Guelph, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Ker, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",aker@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

An equilibrium displacement model is constructed, linking the supply of disaggregate farm commodities with final consumer food demands. Using state-specific data on farm commodity production, crop insurance payments, food expenditures, and federal tax payments, the welfare effects of the removal of the premium subsidies for crop insurance are calculated for each state in the United States. Results indicate that the removal of the premium subsidy for crop insurance would have resulted in aggregate net economic benefits of $622, $932, and $522 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. The deadweight loss amounts to about 9.6%, 14.4%, and 8.0% of the total crop insurance subsides paid to agricultural producers in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. In aggregate, removal of the premium subsidy for crop insurance reduces farm producer surplus and consumer surplus, with taxpayers being the only aggregate beneficiary. The findings reveal that the costs of such farm policies are often hidden from food consumers in the form of a higher tax burden. On a disaggregate level, there is significant variation in effects of removal of the premium subsidy for crop insurance across states. Agricultural producers in several Western states, such as California, Oregon, and Washington, are projected to benefit from the removal of the premium subsides for crop insurance, whereas producers in the Plains States, such as North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas, are projected to be the biggest losers.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jayson.lusk@okstate.edu,,,Mercatus Center at George Mason University; Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station; Willard Sparks Endowed Chair,Mercatus Center at George Mason University; Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station; Willard Sparks Endowed Chair,"Partial funding support for this research came from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Willard Sparks Endowed Chair.",,31,26,34,0,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Utilising the annual data for the sample period 1996-2013, the empirical analysis is carried out using the dynamic panel regression analysis and the Granger causality tests. The estimation results based on the alternative specification of regression equations for the unemployment rate suggest that the unemployment rate is negatively related to the relative GDP share of agriculture. In addition, a similar effect has been obtained for some other explanatory variables we have included in the unemployment equation as controlling variables: higher investment rate and trade openness are likely to lower the rate of unemployment. The financial development has also been found to be negatively related to the unemployment rate, although the statistical significance of its effect depends on the estimation technique used. On the other hand, the GDP growth and the government consumption have been found to be insignificantly related to the unemployment rate. While the Granger causality tests performed for each country produced evidence of a causal effect of the relative GDP share of agriculture in some countries, in some other countries the direction of causality has been found to be from the unemployment rate to the relative GDP share of agriculture. Our findings suggest that agriculture may play a potential role in lowering the prevailing rates of high unemployment; but this potential is likely to vary between countries.","[Bein, Murad A.] Cyprus Int Univ, Lefkosa, Turkey; [Ciftcioglu, Serhan] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Gazimagusa, Turkey",Cyprus International University; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Bein, MA (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Lefkosa, Turkey.",aziz.murad@gmail.com,"Bein, Murad Abdurahman/KBB-6401-2024","Bein, Murad Abdurahman/0000-0002-3248-4316",,,,,29,5,5,1,17,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Given that the selection bias may occur when farmers themselves decide whether or not to acquire the information to understand the essence of organic farming, this study employs a recursive bivariate probit model to address the issue of the selection bias. Findings - The empirical results indicate that farmers' decision to acquire information is positively affected by farmers' environmental awareness, access to credit and access to information. In particular, information acquisition appears to increase the likelihood of farmers' willingness to adopt organic farming by 35.9 percentage points on average. Practical implications - The findings suggest that measures increasing farmers' information exposure can be promising policy interventions to induce adoption of organic farming. Originality/value - While considerable evidence indicates that organic farming provides more benefits than conventional production practice, little is known about farmers' willingness to adopt in China. This paper provides a first attempt by examining the role of information acquisition in determining Chinese apple farmers' willingness to adopt.","[Ma, Wanglin] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany; [Ma, Chunbo] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Crawley, Australia; [Su, Ye] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Kearney, NE USA; [Nie, Zihan] Wageningen Univ, Dept Econ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Kiel; University of Western Australia; University of Nebraska System; University Nebraska Kearney; Wageningen University & Research,"Ma, WL (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",wma0413@163.com,"Su, Ye/ITV-8936-2023; Ma, Chunbo/D-3478-2011; Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019","Ma, Chunbo/0000-0002-9973-2943; Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459",,,,,32,22,24,9,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This aspect is closely related to the so-called information need. The paper aims to evaluate the current state of the information needs and information support and their impacts on small farms in the Czech Republic. There is a strong necessity to improve the economic performance of farms in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the need for the introduction of new ICT in farming and farm management has rapidly increased at present. In farming, the ICT directly supports the operational agricultural activities and it can also serve as an interactive and flexible tool for monitoring the progress of the farm economic performance. The analysis of the current state of the issue of information needs and dispositions among Czech farms was based on the questionnaire survey. We obtained 165 correctly filled answers from agricultural enterprises. Survey results are analysed with descriptive statistics, frequency tables, the clustering analysis and the correlation analysis. The results show that with 95% probability: (1) The level of the information needs is related to the current state of the ICT and the decision support system at the farm, (2) The influence of the information need level to the level of new technologies usage was not confirmed, (3) Legislation issues represent a crucial part of the information needs of agricultural subjects, (4) Large enterprises with more than 500 ha have a much better level of the information support than the companies with fewer hectares, (5) Companies with less than three employees face problems with their information support, (6) Czech farms in average use advanced ICT and information systems, and (7) The farmer's decision-making is not strongly facilitated through the ICT.","[Tyrychtr, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vostrovsky, Vaclav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Software Engn, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Tyrychtr, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic.",tyrychtr@pef.czu.cz; vostrovsky@pef.czu.cz,"Tyrychtr, Jan/A-1873-2017; Vostrovsky, Vaclav/H-8249-2018","Tyrychtr, Jan/0000-0001-9952-2180; Vostrovsky, Vaclav/0000-0003-4228-0859","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [20141036]","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague","Supported by the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague (Grant No. 20141036 - Analysis and approach to the solution of information and knowledge needs in the agricultural sector in the context of agricultural eGovernment).",,19,7,7,0,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Employing unique panel data from smallholder farmers in India, negative environmental and health effects of pesticide use are quantified with the environmental impact quotient (EIQ), with and without Bt technology. An environmentally sensitive dynamic production function is estimated, treating the environmental risk of pesticide toxicity as an undesirable output in the production process. Negative externalities are significantly lower in Bt than in conventional cotton. The reduction in EIQ through Bt technology adoption has increased from 39 per cent during 2002-2004 to 68 per cent during 2006-2008. Bt adoption has also contributed to higher environmental efficiency. Environmental efficiency is influenced by the quality of Bt technology: high-quality Bt seeds are associated with higher environmental efficiency than lower-quality seeds.","[Veettil, Prakashan Chellattan] Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, New Delhi, India; [Krishna, Vijesh V.; Qaim, Matin] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Veettil, PC (通讯作者)，Int Rice Res Inst, Social Sci Div, New Delhi, India.",p.chellattanveettil@irri.org,"Krishna, Vijesh/AAD-3431-2022; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Krishna, Vijesh/0000-0003-2191-4736; Chellattan Veettil, Prakashan/0000-0002-2125-0178",,,,,41,22,24,3,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

To measure changes in the cost of reaching international standards of diet quality, we introduce a new cost of diet diversity index based on the lowest-cost way to include at least five different food groups as defined by the widely used minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) indicator and compare that to a Cost of Nutrient Adequacy indicator for the lowest-cost way to meet estimated average requirements of essential nutrients and dietary energy. We demonstrate application of both indexes using national average monthly prices from two very different sources: an agricultural market information system in Ghana (2009-14) and the data used for national consumer price indexes in Tanzania (2011-15). We find that the cost of diet diversity index for Ghana fluctuated seasonally and since mid-2010 rose about 10% per year faster than national inflation, due to rising relative prices for fruit, which also drove up the cost of nutrient adequacy. In Tanzania there were much smaller changes in total daily costs, but more adjustment in the mix of food groups used for the least-cost diet. These methods can show where and when nutritious diets are increasingly (un)affordable, and which nutritional criteria account for the change. These results are based on monthly national average prices, but the method is generalizable to other contexts for monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of changing food environments.","[Masters, William A.; Bai, Yan; Herforth, Anna; Coates, Jennifer C.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Sarpong, Daniel B.] Univ Ghana, Sch Agr, Accra, Ghana; [Sarpong, Daniel B.] Univ Ghana, Agr Econ, Accra, Ghana; [Mishili, Fulgence] Sokoine Univ Agr Tanzania, Agr Econ, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Kinabo, Joyce] Sokoine Univ Agr Tanzania, Human Nutr, Morogoro, Tanzania",Tufts University; University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Masters, WA (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,"McIntyre, Lauren/AAC-8416-2020; Masters, William A./A-4796-2017; Sarpong, Daniel/P-9584-2019","Masters, William A./0000-0002-4546-7291;",,,,,43,51,56,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We further allow for differential nutrient demand response to income depending on where a household is in the caloric availability distribution. We find that some nutrients are income inelastic indicating that they are necessity goods while others are relatively income elastic. We further test and reject equivalent nutrient-income elasticities across the caloric availability distribution. Households in the lowest calorie quintile have highly income elastic nutrient demand leaving them vulnerable to income fluctuations. Moreover, as households meet their first-order caloric needs, they substitute away from cheap calorie-dense staples toward more expensive nutrient-dense foods. Finally, for most nutrients, households in the highest calorie quintile exhibit more elastic nutrient demand, similar to households in the lowest quintile. Our results suggest that policies aimed at improving income will likely also improve household nutrient availability, particularly for the most calorie poor households. They further suggest that policies aimed at protecting poor households from negative income shocks will also likely yield nutritional benefits.","[Ali, Mohammad; Villa, Kira M.] Univ New Mexico, MSC 05 3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Joshi, Janak] Cent Michigan Univ, 1200 S Franklin St, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",University of New Mexico; Central Michigan University,"Ali, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, MSC 05 3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",moali@unm.edu,,,,,,,59,9,11,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

As a result, farmers inside irrigation districts are able to plant more water-intensive crops than farmers outside irrigation districts, which increases average profitability. We empirically examine this hypothesis by leveraging a georeferenced panel data set at the spatial scale of the individual water right and spanning 2007-14 in Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain. Our results indicate that on average, irrigation districts allocate larger portions of their land to drought-sensitive, high-value crops such as sugar beets and potatoes.

Poor small-scale farmers in this region are particularly vulnerable to this variability. As a result, households may be reluctant to adopt new agricultural water management (AWM) technologies when they involve more risk than what they mitigate. Despite risk's role in AWM investments, there have been few attempts to estimate the magnitude and nature of risk aversion in relation to this type of farm decisions. To partially close this gap, this article uses an experimental approach applied to 137 households in Northern Ghana. We find that more than 70% of households are moderately or slightly risk averse. This contrasts with other studies in SSA, where most household decision-makers exhibit severe to extreme risk aversion. We also find that households that stand to lose as well as gain something from participation in games are less risk averse than households playing gains-only games. This result suggests that most farmers' current wealth put them at risk of falling into a poverty trap. Thus, the losses from the riskiest investments on AWM technologies may fall more heavily on the poor, suggesting that additional efforts be given to the creation of viable insurance mechanisms.","[Katic, Pamela] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England; [Ellis, Tim] Environm Southland, Invercargill, New Zealand",University of Greenwich,"Katic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham, Kent, England.",p.g.katic@gre.ac.uk,,,USAID-Feed the Future /Africa RISING Research for Development Programme,USAID-Feed the Future /Africa RISING Research for Development Programme(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),We wish to acknowledge the USAID-Feed the Future /Africa RISING Research for Development Programme for funding this study.

Our results show that for every percentage point of additional exports, U.S. turkey producers avoided a loss of about $6 million.","[Cakir, Metin; Boland, Michael A.; Wang, Yanghao] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Çakir, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",mcakir@umn.edu,"Wang, Yanghao/Q-2811-2018","Wang, Yanghao/0000-0003-2572-987X",University of Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station,University of Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station,"We would like to thank Dominique Rolando for his help in preparing the appendix to the manuscript.

The results from the household fixed-effects model indicate that submergence in the previous year increased the adoption of submergence-tolerant rice. The adoption impact was larger among farmers who were neighbors of early seed recipients.

As opposed to ex ante analyses, my econometric results indicate that the air quality regulation has not significantly affected the total costs of milk production. Estimates also suggest that the regulation might have differential effects on different elements of costs. I support the econometric findings with evidence on how dairy farms comply with the regulation.

We use panel data from rural Ethiopia to investigate whether participation in a safety net program enhances fertilizer adoption. Using a difference-in-differences estimator and inverse propensity score weighting, we find that participation in Ethiopia's food-for-work (FFW) program increased fertilizer adoption in the short run, but not in the long run. Results also indicate that the intensity of fertilizer usage increased with livestock holdings for FFW-participant households, providing some evidence that the intervention helped asset-rich farm households more than asset-poor households. We find no significant effects of free distribution on fertilizer adoption or intensification. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that safety nets can be viewed as mechanisms that allow households to take on more risk to pursue higher profits. The results highlight the importance of safety net programs, their effectiveness in ensuring farmers that they will be protected against uninsured shocks, and how that assurance can translate into productivity-enhancing behavior.","[Alem, Yonas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Broussard, Nzinga H.] Millennium Challenge Corp, Washington, DC 20005 USA",University of Gothenburg,"Broussard, NH (通讯作者)，Millennium Challenge Corp, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",broussardnh@mcc.gov,,,Swedish Research Council Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources' (COMMONS),Swedish Research Council Formas through the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources' (COMMONS),"The findings and conclusions expressed in this article are those of the author, and may not be attributed to the Millennium Challenge Corporation, its Executive Board, or the Government of the United States.

J,"Anderson, K",,,,"Anderson, Kym",,,From taxing to subsidizing farmers in China post-1978,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,Agricultural support policies; China's economic growth; Food security; Multiple exchange rates,POLICY,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to document the pace and extent to which China's policy regime has transitioned over the past four decades from explicitly and implicitly taxing to subsidizing its farmers relative to its producers of other tradable goods; to present projections of the world economy to 2030 that suggest China will continue to become more food import-dependent under current policies and productivity growth rates; and to explore alternative policy instruments for remaining food secure and ensuring that farmers are not losers from economic growth. Design/methodology/approach - The data used to estimate the extent of distortions to producer incentives come from freely available World Bank and OECD sources that allow direct comparisons of China's policy developments with those of more-and less-advanced economies. Findings - The estimates of nominal and relative rates of assistance to farmers reveal that China has made the transition from negative to positive assistance to farmers far faster than an average developing country, and almost as fast as its Northeast Asian neighbors did in earlier decades at similar levels of real per capita incomes. That helped to ensure China remained food self-sufficient during the first two decades of reform; but self-sufficiency is now declining and is projected to continue to do so over the next decade under current policies. Research limitations/implications - Preventing food self-sufficiency from declining further by increasing agricultural protection would be very costly, and is now unnecessary, thanks to the information and communication technology revolution that enables the government to directly support the well-being of poor farm households with conditional cash transfers. Originality/value - This review of indicators of distortions to agricultural incentives in China is based on estimates of nominal and relative rates of assistance and consumer tax equivalents that are in the public domain. Its originality is in presenting the estimates for China in a comparative perspective, showing how they have evolved over time and as real per capita incomes have grown, and relating that to developments in China's self-sufficiency in agricultural and food products. The paper also points to more-efficient ways of achieving societal objectives than using policy instruments that distort producer and consumer prices.","[Anderson, Kym] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Anderson, Kym] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Adelaide; Australian National University,"Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Anderson, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",kym.anderson@adelaide.edu.au,"Anderson, Kym/G-7292-2012","Anderson, Kym/0000-0002-1472-3352",,,,,27,7,7,5,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach It quantitatively analyzes the impact of each ongoing social security policy on farmland reallocation based on a data set from the 2011 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011). Findings The study finds that the inclination of a village farmers' collective to reallocate farmland due to changes in the village population increased if social security policies do not effectively cover the village because farmers rely primarily on income from farmland to cover their basic living expenses. However, if social security policies provide adequate coverage, then farmers do not rely entirely on on-farm income and the likelihood of farmland reallocation decreases. Furthermore, the effectiveness of social security policies includes not only coverage but also the sufficiency of the security policies provided. Research limitations/implications First, the authors use only cross-sectional data in this study, which may result in biased estimation and also limit temporal examination of the impact of social security systems, farmland reallocation and related policy variables. This limitation may be especially important in China because the country is undergoing a rapid socioeconomic transition. However, the research is constrained by the available data. Furthermore, there could be endogeneity problems that are difficult to address, given the current data set. These problems could involve the impacts of village-level economic, natural and social variables, the implementation of related public policies (land development and consolidation, land expropriation, etc.) and other economic variables. Practical implications These findings may provide implications for related policy reform in the near future. Originality/value These findings may facilitate a recognition and understanding of the causality between social security policies and farmland reallocation in rural China.","[Huang, Li] China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tan, Rong] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Land Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Wuhan; Zhejiang University,"Tan, R (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Dept Land Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",tanrong@zju.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [71573231]; Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA020, 14AZD028, 13AZD012, 14ZDA039]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research has received financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of China through project No. 71573231, the Social Science Foundation of China through project No. 16ZDA020, No. 14AZD028, No. 13AZD012 and No. 14ZDA039, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

However, for agricultural trade, few studies have considered the factors affecting export survival. This article identifies factors affecting the duration of fresh fruit and vegetable exports to the U.S. market, including U.S. sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) policy regulations. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, our preferred model with exporter binary variables indicates that changes in U.S. commodity prices and exporter gross domestic product have the largest impact, whereas U.S. production variability and exporter experience have the lowest impacts on the hazard rate of export duration. Second, SPS treatment requirements have persistent impacts on trade duration. Water treatment requirements quadruple the average hazard rate in the first year of a spell of service, and while the hazard rate does diminish over time, it is still nearly three times the average hazard rate, even after the fourth year of the spell of service. Similarly, a combination treatment of fumigation and cold treatment/refrigeration more than triples the average hazard rate in the first year of the spell of service, but this effect diminishes more quickly over time.","[Peterson, Everett B.; Grant, Jason H.] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Rudi-Polloshka, Jeta] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Peterson, EB (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",petrsone@vt.edu,,,National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Research Initiative [2014-67023-21816],National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Research Initiative,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Research Initiative, project # 2014-67023-21816.

Design/methodology/approach Based on a three-year panel data set covering 3,421 rice farmers in 12 Chinese provinces collected from the state rice industry experiment stations' fixed watch points of China Agriculture Research System, a stochastic frontier model which takes the price vectors of input variables into cost function is developed by stochastic frontier analysis method in the study. Findings There is a deviation between the actual cost and the minimum cost on rice production in China due to the loss of cost efficiency, whose score is 0.7983 at the mean. Agricultural services can help improve cost efficiency, thus contributing to cost saving. Specifically, the effect of technical service on cost saving is the highest, followed by processing and sales service, machinery service, financial service and agricultural materials supply service.

However, no economic measures for early detection have been analysed in an optimising framework. We investigate the use of bulk milk testing (BMT) for active surveillance against an FMD incursion in Australia. We find that BMT can be justified, but only when the FMD entry probability is sufficiently high or the cost of BMT is low. However, BMT is well suited for post-outbreak surveillance, to shorten the length of time and size of an epidemic and to facilitate an earlier return to market.","[Kompas, Tom; Pham Van Ha] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr Biosecur & Environm Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kompas, Tom] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Excellence Biosecur Risk Anal, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kompas, Tom] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hoa Thi Minh Nguyen] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [East, Iain; Roche, Sharon; Garner, Graeme] Dept Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Anim Hlth Epidemiol, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Australian National University,"Kompas, T (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Australian Ctr Biosecur & Environm Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",tom.kompas@anu.edu.au,"Kompas, Tom/M-8851-2019; Nguyen, Hoa-Thi-Minh/E-7491-2012","Kompas, Tom/0000-0002-0665-0966; Nguyen, Hoa-Thi-Minh/0000-0002-9237-7731",Centre of Excellence in Biosecurity Risk Analysis at the University of Melbourne [1304A],Centre of Excellence in Biosecurity Risk Analysis at the University of Melbourne,Funding from the Centre of Excellence in Biosecurity Risk Analysis (Project 1304A) at the University of Melbourne is gratefully acknowledged.,,70,15,15,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

However, the mainstream system is highly path-dependent, and resistant to reform. Change can be expected neither from government action, nor from business initiatives alone, and grassroots innovations led by ordinary people have a limited impact. Only by connecting these different pathways for reform by food democracy can lasting food systems reform be achieved.","[De Schutter, Olivier] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [De Schutter, Olivier] Sci Po Paris, Paris, France",Universite Catholique Louvain,"De Schutter, O (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;De Schutter, O (通讯作者)，Sci Po Paris, Paris, France.",olivier.deschutter@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,135,74,75,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.
