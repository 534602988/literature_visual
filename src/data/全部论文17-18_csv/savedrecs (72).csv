The paper is aimed at substantiating and developing the major components of the concept of a new motivational environment on the basis of the economic phenomenon of happiness from the standpoint of subjective assessments by the younger generation, and identifying general objective factors and conditions that determine happiness. The authors prove the hypothesis that subjective evaluation of the state of happiness is founded on objective and universal factors forming the economic phenomenon of happiness in the new economic reality. The study covered young people as the most creative group of population with lower social inertia. The quantitative and qualitative methods of statistical analysis were applied: time series, the ranking method, rank correlation, correlation and regression analysis and econometric modeling. The study proves that material conditions and socio-psychological factors are the elements of a single system that, when interacting, produce a synergy effect generating a qualitatively new motivation for enhancing economic activity that ensures effective self-realization. The identified objective factors in social and economic equilibrium (happiness) are proposed as the basis for the formation policy of a new motivational environment that ensures the realization of economic interests of people, especially the youth.","[Ilyukhin, A.

Our review of existing methodologies in the field of structural analysis of system objects has shown that the process-oriented methodology of information system design, based on IDEF-technologies (standards), should be used to improve the quality of project solutions. We have performed a CAD-simulation using this technique on the basis of the generally accepted sequence of design stages, taking into account the identified factors that determine the choice of requirements for inclusive clothing for people with musculoskeletal disorders. In addition, we have identified the factors that determine the choice of requirements for inclusive clothing for people with musculoskeletal disorders. Also we the proposed the principles for evaluating the quality of design solutions for inclusive clothing. The obtained model of the automated process of designing inclusive clothes based on the IDEF0 standards has been tested as an example of clothes for people using wheelchair. The gradual assessment of the quality of design solutions has shown a high level of inclusive clothes quality with a significant reduction in material consumption, time and labor intensity of work at all stages of design.","[Zaytseva, T.

The test rig consists of a number of essential components including a CO2 turboexpander with high speed generator, finned-tube air cooled condenser, liquid receiver, CO2 liquid pump and CO2 gas generator. The CO2 is heated in the plate-type gas generator by hot thermal oil flow which is circulated and heated by exhaust flue gases from an 80kWe microturbine CUP unit. The test rig has been fully commissioned, instrumented, controlled and is ready to operate experiment as required. Subsequently, at constant heat sink (ambient) and heat source (thermal oil) temperatures, a series of experiments have been carried out to examine the effects of various important parameters on the T-CO2 system performance. These include thermal oil flow rate and CO2 mass flow rate etc. Preliminary experimental results show that the CO2 TPC is applicable for the low temperature heat sources to generate power although further efficiency improvements are needed. In addition, the experimental outcomes can instruct future optimal system design and controls. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We present variational formulation of American option problem with special attention to early exercise action effect. Next, we discuss financially motivated additive decomposition of American option price into a European option price and another part due to the extra premium required by early exercising the option contract. As the optimal exercise boundary is a free boundary, its determination is coupled with the determination of the option price. Therefore, a closed-form expression of the free boundary is not attainable in general. We discuss in detail a derivation of an asymptotic expression of the early exercise boundary. Finally, we present some numerical results of determination of free boundary based upon this approach.

There is a great demand for cost effective and sustainable antifouling solutions. An increase in internal fouling results in poor thermal efficiency during food processing. This is coupled with poor heat and mass transfer local to the metal surface of designed heat exchangers, pipes and other equipment. Internal fouling could also potentially increase unwanted fluid flow pressure due to restricted flow. [1, 2] It is demonstrated in this work, how fouling is mitigated with ultrasound non-invasively during pilot scale production. When using a plate heat exchanger set-point temperature of 140 degrees C, 128 degrees C and 138 degrees C was achieved without and with an attached ultrasonic transducer respectively. The duration for complete fouling of a tubular heat exchanger increased from 10 to 25 hours with ultrasonic transducers. The presence of ultrasound reduces the carbon footprint owing to substantially reduced fouling. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The next part of the article describes the research methodology. The method of DEA used for the evaluation is applied to the NUTS 3 regions based on a particular set of regional input and output variables and other regional characteristics. The regional inputs and outputs variables form the key elements of the system evaluated for each administrative region in the sense of its effective resp. ineffective economic status.

Variance and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are assumed as risk measures and mean-risk optimal portfolios are then compared to 1/N strategy on out of the sample dataset where its performance is discussed in detail. Both algorithms outperformed 1/N strategy on risk-adjusted basis on simulated dataset of stable multivariate-normally distributed returns.

This paper is devoted to the problem where a decision-maker (company) chooses a portfolio of suppliers to cover all his/her supply needs. It is shown here that it is insufficient to take the ranking of suppliers and to select the first few in order. The problem is solved by the PROMETHEE V method, which is a unique combination of the outranking method of multi-attribute decision-making and mathematical optimisation (first, the rankings of alternatives is found using the PROMETHEE II method, and then the optimal portfolio is selected based on that ranking using the integer programming).

The modern concept also covers the nutrition factor and problems, which are related with falsification, the use of the new food technologies including the production of the food products by genetic engineering and nanotechnology, the use of the complex food additives and the introduction of the new types of the packaging materials.

This problem can be solved with the help of the roles and responsibilities matrix which provides a clear definition of the staff's functions. It also shows the possibilities for interaction and the adequate distribution of responsibilities within an organization. Designing the university's quality management system means defining the staff's competences and responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities matrix relies on the inventory of the university's activities and processes. It is also based on a thorough analysis of the university's structure. Unlike the job description which defines the roles and responsibilities of a particular employee and mainly reflects the vertical relationships in a hierarchy, the responsibility matrix shows clearly the relationships between several employees who are active participants included in an integrated system. Furthermore, the matrix enables executives to avoid the duplication of functions; it accelerates decision-making and raises accountability. In fact, the responsibility matrix represents a table of binary relations between a certain amount of business processes and the body of staff and departments within an organization. The horizontal lines of the table connect the university's business processes and the vertical columns contain the representatives of the educational institution. The responsibility matrix allows executives to evaluate the data horizontally and vertically. On the one hand, the executives are able to identify the participants of a certain process, to evaluate the effectiveness of the allocation of assignments and duties. On the other hand, they can estimate the amount and content of a certain work load within a particular business process. The analysis of the responsibility matrix results in the definition of duties, roles and the type of interaction between the representatives of the university's administration staff. This data underlies the job descriptions and department regulations. As a result, the responsibility matrix requires the evaluation of the university's organizational structure and basic processes. The responsibility matrix represents a table of binary relations between a certain number of business processes and a body of the administration staff within an organization.","[Eremenko, S.

The accomplishment of the targeted objective depends on an insightful monitoring of the situation of persons with disabilities. Factors that differentiate persons with disabilities with respect to their economic activity have been identified focusing on the problem of employment of disabled persons. For this purpose a multivariate correspondence analysis was applied with data provided by the National Census of Population and Housing 2011.

The structural components of this concept, which initially included knowledge, skills and excellence acquired by people through education and training in accordance with the requirements of the federal state educational standards for higher education, were transformed into general-cultural, general-professional and professional competences. The authors give their own definition of the concept a future economist's competitiveness and define its structural components. The choice of the competitiveness' structural components, which are the abilities (informational, communicative, analytical, projective, evaluative-reflective, value-orientational), is determined by the specific types of a future economist's professional activities: computational-economic, analytical, research, organizational-managerial. The technology of project activity is considered to be an effective means of forming future economists' competitiveness in the process of professional training. The authors believe that the optimal condition for developing future economists' competitiveness is the interrelationship between educational and extracurricular activities. This interrelationship is ensured by establishing the interdisciplinary links between the professional subjects, the humanitarian discipline Foreign Language and the Business Club activities. It is proved by high awards of the future economists' projects presented at international and university competitions and conferences and by the data of diagnosing the formed levels of future economists' competitiveness on the basis of cognitive, motivational-value and activity-related criteria and corresponding indicators which showed a positive dynamics of the increased level of future economists' competitiveness.","[Snigireva, E.

Today the Internet is the main channel for the transfer of socialized content within the framework of formalized secondary socialization. One of the form of the influence is distance education. Distance education is aimed to people who have already passed the stage of primary socialization, except for individual cases when distance learning is used in the framework of primary socialization. Within the Internet there is a fairly large number of types of distance learning, which now are an effective educational tool.

Theoretical significance of the paper lies in developing approaches to the BRICS currencies' internationalization as a multi-dimensional process. The article is also theoretically significant because its major outcomes and conclusions deepen and enrich the theory of the currency internationalization by means of analyzing the BRICS currencies' circulation and use in the contemporary WSC.

This technology will enable low-grade waste heat (LGWH) to be recovered cost effectively for the first time, with attractive returns on investment and rapid payback. LGWH is heat below 100 degrees C and there is no cost effective solution commercially available and, as 63% of waste heat is at a temperature below 100 degrees C, there is a significant untapped resource. Cost effectiveness is the key barriers that have left this market untapped. Exergyn's technology will change this as it is very simple, which allows costs to be reduced, and will enable LGWH to be recovered in a wide range of applications to deliver low cost, zero emission electricity on demand. The Exergyn Drive (TM) applies a solid state drive to utilise hot water of suitable temperatures (c. 90 degrees C) from sources such as reciprocating engines, industrial processes or geothermal resources. Installation is also simple, potentially a flow and return from the heat source and an electrical hook up utilising heat directly from engine jackets without the need for heat exchangers, which enhances efficiency and reduces costs. The low through life costs give, making low grade waste heat recovery attractive for the first time. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Max-min (fuzzy) equations have found a broad area of applications in causal models which emphasize relationships between input and output variables. They are used in diagnosis models or models of non-deterministic systems. Many practical situations can be described using max-min matrix equations. It often happens that a max-min matrix equation with exact data is unsolvable. Therefore, we replace matrix elements with intervals of possible values. In this way, we obtain an interval matrix equation. We shall deal with interval max-min matrix equations with bounded solution, in which a solution has to be from the given interval of possible values. We can define several types of solvability of interval max-min matrix equations with bounded solution. In this paper, we shall deal with four of them. We prove the necessary and sufficient conditions which can be verified in polynomial time.","[Myskova, Helena] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Theoret Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04200, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Mysková, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Theoret Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04200, Slovakia.",helena.myskova@tuke.sk,"Myšková, Helena/AAA-6088-2020",,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,499,504,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400085,0

In analogous way, the assumption of market price decrease is described as the negative orientation of ordered fuzzy number. In this way, PV is presented as ordered fuzzy number [2]. So specified PV is used for determine the return rate which is defined as any decreasing function of PV and increasing function of future value (FV). With the obvious assumption that the FV is a random variable, determined return rate is described as ordered fuzzy random variable.

The problem is complex because there is lack of risk assessment methods which allow to prepare a full risk analysis, in particular dedicated for the industrial areas. The article provides a concept of application of mixed method study for assessing the risk for one foundry in Poland. Castings production is an specific industry where the processes are very complicated and unstable, therefore the use of a multiple tool to illustrate the risk will be an added value for the company. This kind of approach allows to make a full risk assessment analysis what cannot be done by a single statistical techniques with some limitations. In this paper empirical and simulation data is used. The proposal of multi-tool can enable effective risk estimation, assist in determining the significance of the data set and to facilitate accurate decision-making. It can be used to predict and prevent problems, reduce cost and shorten the development time. The economic and practical benefits resulting from the application of the proposed solution are presented.

A special case of such problems appears in the personnel task scheduling where the decision maker (manager) is looking for a minimal number of workers to cover all prescribed shifts. This problem can be classified as a tactical fixed interval scheduling. In this paper, we focus on scheduling of jobs with uncertain processing intervals where the finishing times are modelled as random variables with a known probability distribution. We provide a stochastic integer programming formulation with a joint chance constraint which ensures the reliability of the resulting schedule. We propose an iterative decomposition algorithm for a reformulation where the partial operational FIS problems can be solved as the min-cost network flow problems. The performance of the algorithm is verified on simulated instances.","[Branda, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Branda, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675, Czech Republic.",branda@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Branda, Martin/M-4304-2013",,Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under the Grant P402/12/G097 (DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics).,,17,1,1,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,78,83,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400014,0

In health economics, three types of models are most commonly used to this purpose: Markov cohort model, Monte Carlo simulation and discrete event simulation (DES). In the first part of the paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and their use in the context of the Czech health-care system and data availability. It is argued that DES is the preferred method with regards to results accuracy since the other methods rely more heavily on a number of questionable assumptions. However, the quality of the data we have collected for Czechia does not allow us to directly use this method. Consequently, we start to build our model on the methodology using Monte Carlo simulation that was previously established to estimate economic outcomes of early identification of AD in the USA. Bearing in mind the specificities of the Czech context as well as the existing data sources, and upon careful scrutiny of each parameter and assumption, we modify this model to bring it as close to DES as possible.","[Smrckova, Hana Marie; Sladek, Vaclav; Arltova, Marketa; Cerny, Jakub] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Smrcková, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xsmrh00@vse.cz; xslav20@vse.cz; arltova@vse.cz; xcerj129@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018","Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague [F4/38/2017]","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the grant No. F4/38/2017 of the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague.",,16,0,0,0,8,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,690,695,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400118,0

These cabinets, however, are less energy efficient than cabinets with glass doors because of the interactions between the air curtain, that is used to provide an artificial barrier between the air in the cabinets, and the air in food premises. To improve the energy efficiency of open fronted refrigerated display cabinets, many types of air curtains have been designed, including single layer air curtains, multi-layer air curtains and shelf tip air curtains amongst others. An approach, considered in recent years to improve the efficiency of air curtains is the use of air guiding strips at the front face of the shelves of open-type vertical refrigerated display cabinets with single layer air curtains. This paper uses Computational Fluid Dynamics modelling to investigate the influence of air guiding strips on the performance of vertical multi-deck refrigerated display cabinets. The results showed that the air guiding strips accelerate the air curtain vertically; leading to a stronger and stiffer air curtain, consequently inhibit the infiltration of the ambient warm air into the cabinet. The average temperature of simulated food in the cabinet decreases by 4.9 degrees C compared to the cabinet without the strip due to the improved protection of the stiffer air curtain. The cooling capacity required to maintain the food chilled decreases by 34%. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Then, we develop a simplified method to compute the IV least square prenucleolus of a special subclass of IV cooperative games with fuzzy coalitions in Choquet integral forms. In this method, we give some weaker coalition size monotonicity-like conditions, which can always ensure that the least square prenucleolus of our defined cooperative games with fuzzy coalitions in Choquet integral form are monotonic and non-decreasing functions of fuzzy coalitions' values. Hereby, the lower and upper bounds of the proposed IV least square prenucleolus can be directly obtained via utilizing the lower and upper bounds of the IV coalitions values, respectively.

The findings of this experiment are then thoroughly reviewed and generalized.","[Katakhova, N., V; Kursevich, D., V] MTU MIREA, Dept Foreign Languages, Moscow, Russia",MIREA - Russian Technological University,"Katakhova, NV (通讯作者)，MTU MIREA, Dept Foreign Languages, Moscow, Russia.",katakhova@mirea.ru; kursevich@mirea.ru,"Katakhova, Nataliya/AAZ-4538-2021; Kursevich, Dmitry/AAZ-4539-2021",,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,388,391,,,,,,4,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800086,0

Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is one of the main leafy vegetables contributing to the RTE industry. Due to its tender and soft texture, spinach leaves tend to undergo different degrees of injuries during processing steps which affect their quality and shelf life. In this study, the effect of compression on quality degradation of spinach leaves during storage was investigated. Spinach leaves were subjected to compression using Universal Testing Machine where Young's modulus for spinach in bulk amount; imitating packaged spinach in the industry was evaluated. Visual appearance was assessed by Population test where leaves were classified into categories according to degree of damage and percentage of deterioration was evaluated by analyzing RGB images using ImageJ. To understand the behavior better, microstructural property of the spinach was observed under light microscope. Organic spinach was found to be the best in resisting stress and damage compared to Teen, Salad and Baby spinach. Reducing weight of spinach inside the packaging bag, while putting appropriate weight reduced the possibility of the leaves inside the bag to be compressed due to the crowdedness inside the bag thus lowered the risk for accidental mechanical leaf damage. Including already broken leaves inside the packaging bag together with good leaves accelerates the deterioration of the whole leaves inside the bag. Halfway and complete teared leaves were found to be not acceptable to eat after 8 days of storage whereas control, undamaged and minor teared leaves were still acceptable to eat after 14 days of storage. The mechanical stress gave significant effect on the physical quality and mechanical property of spinach. Increasing the compression force did not change the cell sizes but changed the structure of the cells. This work provide basis to understand the physical quality and mechanical property of bulk spinach which can be used to improve the quality and shelf life of the packaged RTE spinach throughout the distribution chain.

I, the effect of freezing with temperature fluctuations on the microstructure and dissolution of aerated and non-aerated freeze-dried concentrated coffee (50 and 60% w/w) is presented. Samples were either frozen at-40 C or subjected to fluctuating temperatures between-40 and-20 degrees C prior to drying. Total freezing time was kept constant for both freezing profiles. Microstructural characteristics of the freeze-dried solids were revealed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high speed camera was used to record the dissolution process. Solution with 60% solids nucleated at lower temperatures (<-20 degrees C) and developed smaller pore sizes (by 70%) than 50% concentration. SEM micrographs of the freeze-dried solids showed the formation of voids similar to the shape of crystal dendrites in less concentrated coffee sample. Aerated systems were characterized by growth of small dendrites (20-40 um) within large air bubbles which diameter varied from 200-1000 um. Meanwhile, collapsed microstructure was observed in 60% coffee but was not visible on aerated sample. Temperature fluctuations doubled the observed pore sizes in both concentrations which effectively accelerated the dissolution process. Morphology of ice crystals is also affected by the periodic temperature fluctuations with growth of hexagonal ice crystals (50100 m) was evidence from the SEM images. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Furthermore, most of the energy sources that drive the industrial sector are fossil fuel based. Every industrial process is characterised by a multitude of waste heat streams at different temperature levels whose recovery would undoubtedly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability of the industrial sites and their products. Waste heat recovery systems can offer significant energy savings and substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions. For the latter to materialise technological improvements and innovations aimed at improving the energy efficiency of heat recovery equipment and reducing installation costs should take place. This paper outlines the opportunities and the potential for industrial heat recovery in the European Union by identifying and quantifying primary energy consumption in the major industrial sectors and their related waste streams and temperature levels. Through a systematic analysis considering waste heat and Carnot's potential estimation, detailed results are given for all industrial sectors, temperature ranges and EU countries.

This methodological approach allowed the author to suggest a coupled three-tier model correlating the urban environment development hierarchy (urban block - neighborhood - community) with three different development technologies implemented by different stakeholders of the investment-construction activity, defined by the author. The model proposed by the author allowed to accurately structure the problem of bringing into step the moves made by stakeholders of the investment-construction process in the form of interrelated subtasks described in the work.

The modified PF describes more adequately real economic processes than traditional PF with constant parameters.

A sharp decline in the production efficiency of the Russian economy was observed at the beginning of the analyzed period in 1990-1994. The unstable growth of the Russian economy corresponds to the period 1995-1997. The decline in the production efficiency of the Russian economy in 1998-1999 was a result of a negative impact of consequences of the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The highest and most stable rates of economic growth due to the impact of intensive factors were observed for the Russian economy during 2000-2008.

The first group is made up of economic factors (spatial and sectoral structure of the economy; taxation (tax burden), population well-being; and available investment resources). The group of institutional factors includes corruption, administrative barriers, the stability of the legal and regulatory framework. The group of social factors encompasses population's expectations, established stereotypes etc. The most important economic factor that is considered in the article is the eco-nomic well-being of the population in Russia's regions. By comparing data for all constituent regions of Russia, the authors have established an inverse correlation between percapita income and the number of people employed in the informal sector. There is a stronger tendency towards nonobserved economic activities in poorer regions and vice versa. The authors also draw a conclusion that cause-effect relationships in the spatial differentiation of the non-observed economy are rarely manifested vividly, and that factors pertaining to the occurrence and spread of this phenomenon vary by region and change over time.

The effect of traditional dough processing steps: dividing, rounding, resting, pinning and panning, on bread roll crumb and finish was investigated. Data presented here suggests that dough can be divided using alternative technologies (Pressure driven (PD); Pressure vacuum (PV); Extrusion (EX)). PV and EX doughs result in good crumb. However, if the number of intermediate handling steps is reduced, the external fmish is poor. Alternative process configurations can be employed to achieve good crumb morphology in bread rolls without oil and dusting flour. However, the external fmish suffers. Suggesting dough handling processes required to achieve a good crumb and a smooth surface may not be complimentarily. There is substantial interplay between dividing approach and intermediate handling in the development of dough to achieve both internal and external bread roll quality attributes. A lower energy process with less dough handling may not actually be cost effective yet. As dough smoothing appears to be required, which may not eliminate the use of process aid.

All carbon containing wastes have an energy potential and the food industry should focus on recovering that energy to offset their reliance on fossil-fuel derived energy sources. This paper focuses on the novel use of intermediate pyrolysis for decarbonizing the food chain, through the treatment of food and packaging waste, to recover energy. The TCR is a versatile technology which overcomes many of the traditional problems associated with fast pyrolysis and can thermo-chemically convert a range of different feedstocks, including inaccessible lignin and some inorganic, recalcitrant materials. The feedstocks are converted into new fuel sources; char, bio-oil (thermally stable) and permanent gases, for further electrical and heat generation. Ultimately with the use of the TCR technology, the food production industry could look to using decentralized power generation located on-site of large food processing facilities to optimize their energy efficiencies.

Bio-gas obtained from anaerobic digestion of farm and food industry waste is largely composed of 60% CH4 and 40% CO2. For injection of bio-methane into the gas distribution network it is necessary to remove CO2 from the biogas so that a richer CH4 stream is injected to satisfy gas network requirements. Chemical separation processes using solvents that react with CO2 or physically processes using adsorbents or membranes in which CO2 is retained are currently under investigation to reduce associated energy consumption whilst maximizing CO2 removal. In the case of sorbent based processes, research is mainly focused on the optimal design of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycles. In this work, a comparative techno-economic study of bio-gas upgrading for bio-methane production using solvent based processes and pressure swing adsorption cycles is presented. The results show that, pressure swing adsorption cycles exhibit 37% lower capital costs and 10% lower average life-time costs compared to solvent based technologies. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The city's image characteristics are identified. The characteristics are the opinions of the following groups of people: city residents, people who know about the city from media sources but have not visited the city before, tourists, holidaymakers, and business people. 4500 people took part in the survey. The following positive image characteristics of Vladivostok have been determined: geographic location (sea city, unique flora and fauna, mild climate, warm and sunny autumn, opportunity for long, recreational use), areas near the city which are rich in various bio resources such as wild-growing herbs, fish and sea weeds of all sortsetc., the status of outpost in the Far East and proximity to the Asia-Pacific countries, and dynamic development. The following aspects have negative impact on the image of Vladivostok: environmental problems (air and sea pollution, lack of green space, poor water quality), high prices, poor level of service in hotels and public catering enterprises, uncomfortable urban environment (poor illumination, bad road and staircase conditions, difficulty in finding required places).

It can help to identify groups of similar objects (e.g. countries) according to selected variables (e.g. economic indicators). The created groups (clusters) can be characterized based either on the variables used in clustering or on some other variables. The problem with using the methods of cluster analysis is that the analyst can obtain different results (assignments of objects into clusters) by different methods, and moreover, he needs to determine the number of clusters. Many coefficients for solving this problem have been proposed until now. However, the suggestion obtained by a certain coefficient can differ from another suggestion obtained by another coefficient. In addition, values of a certain coefficient can differ depending on the implementation in the software product. In this contribution, different approaches to the silhouette coefficient calculation are discussed. They concern the implementations of calculations in the R language and IBM SPSS Statistics system. It is analyzed how the different results influence decisions of an analyst in terms of both the choice of the suitable assignment of objects into clusters obtained by different algorithms, and the determination of the suitable number of clusters.

In practice, the states of the world can be described only vaguely. Therefore, in such a case we dealt with the decision matrix with fuzzy states of the world that were modelled by fuzzy sets on the universal set on which the probability distribution is given. However, the underlying probability distribution itself can be known also only vaguely. In such a case it is appropriate to apply a fuzzy probability measure. In the paper, we consider the case where the set of elementary events is finite and the probabilities of elementary events are fuzzy. We compare two approaches to expression of the expected values and the variances of the outcomes of alternatives. The first approach is inspired by the probability of a fuzzy event proposed by Zadeh. The second one is based on treating the decision matrix as a fuzzy rule bases system. We illustrate the problem by a numerical example from economic practice.","[Rotterova, Pavla; Pavlacka, Ondrej] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Rotterová, P (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",pavla.rotterova01@upol.cz; ondrej.pavlacka@upol.cz,,,Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc [IGA_PrF_2017_019],Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc,Supported by the grant IGA_PrF_2017_019 Mathematical Models of the Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University Olomouc.,,10,1,1,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,626,631,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400107,0

The aim of such integration is to increase the efficiency of production on the basis of organizational and managerial and technical and technological renovation. The slowed pace of innovation development, due to imperfections in the mechanisms of mastering the achievements of science and technology, are an important reason for the unsatisfactory state of agro-industrial production.

To develop an effective policy of rational use and development of the mineral resource base of the Republic, to solve strategic and operational tasks in the sphere of subsoil use, it is necessary to provide the state bodies of the subsoil fund with economic and analytical materials in the current time and forecast mode. The basic element of these materials is the economic evaluation of mineral and raw materials potential on the basis of the analysis of the situation in the markets for mineral raw materials, taking into account the geological and economic zoning of the territory and the derivation of general information on an electronic cartographic basis. The creation of a system of geological and economic monitoring is possible as a result of stage-by-stage studies of its individual blocks and components, the basis of which is the assessment of mineral resources and geological and economic mapping. The main purpose of this study is to formulate a methodology for geological and economic regionalization to assess the mineral and raw material potential of the region on the example of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The research method involves the development of a system of indicators characterizing the state of the mineral and raw materials base by types of raw materials and specific subsoil use facilities. The main results of the research are: the improvement of the geological and economic geological information methodology and estimation of the cost of geological exploration work to translate the forecast potential of minerals into explored reserves; calculation of the mineral and raw materials potential of reserves and forecasted resources of the main types of minerals on the territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).","[Dadykin, V.

Promoting innovation, the formation of innovative platforms allows the Russian Federation to effectively develop the country's economy, create a competitive environment, and successfully perform in international markets. One of the main elements of innovative development is the creation, promotion and development of startups. Pledge of motivation to increase the number of stra-tums, their growth and development is the formation of fertile soil presented by business incubators and business accelerators. Within the framework of this arti-cle, as an object of the scientific research, we consider business accelerators and its trend of corporate startup accelerator formation. The corporate accelerator is the most effective structure for promotion, develop-ment of startups and the simplest in terms of the company's infrastructure. How-ever, the creation of a corporate accelerator in our country is still not very popular. In many ways this is due to the fact that, firstly, the company does not see the ad-vantages of developing startup projects on its territory, and secondly, it does not have a clear mechanism for creating an accelerator. Within the compass of this study, the main task is to develop a clear, practical-oriented algorithm for corporate startup accelerator implementation. The analysis of the research presented by the authors showed that earlier the topic of creating an algorithm for the implementation of corporate startup accelerators was not raised in the scientific environment. The author analyzes and provides the features and components of the following stages of an accelerator creation: the formation of a mentors team, marketing and economic development of accelerating programs, business planning, the accelera-tor's marketing policy, the search for partners, the formation of its own trust fund, the formation of criteria for startups selecting and evaluating, the description of accelerator business processes, the creation of educational products, planning of accelerator work activities, legal documents processing, projects consulting plan development, the accelerator site creation.","[Danshina, V.

The development rate of small and medium-sized entities was modest over the last years, which was expressed in the growth of the number of enterprises, their financial turnover, the average number of employees. This is connected with certain policy of government support. These days the development of small and medium-sized business entities has obtained the strategic and multi-directional character. In this context, capital leverages hold a special place in the complex of measures of government support, which include taxation. Tax mechanisms are highly important for small and medium-sized entities as the high tax burden does not give them the opportunity to form necessary reserves of current assets, diverting a significant part of financial resources for tax liabilities implementation and specific conditions of participation in tax relationships provide realization of indirect financing which provokes the growth in the informal economy.","[Gorshkova, N., V; Ksenda, V.

Reforms related to tariff regulation, the development of subsidies and the abandonment of cross-subsidization, the delineation of social and energy policies and the introduction of stringent requirements for the quality of ser-vices, the increasing access to financing, and fiscal stimulation of the energy complex are moving slowly and inefficiently. In addition, the aging infrastructure of the energy complex requires large investment. In the conditions of the non-stationary economic regime, the optimal choice of financial, eco-nomic, institutional, administrative and regulatory instruments plays a special role in implementing measures aimed at increasing energy efficiency and de-veloping energy saving. The nature of the use of tools to improve the energy efficiency of the re-gional economy depends primarily on the level of socio-economic develop-ment of the territory that has been achieved. The current market mechanisms do not give the desired effect under non-stationary conditions. In such conditions, The basis for improving the energy efficiency of the region will be the instruments of state support. For the most effective use of instruments of state support in the region, the authors singled out: - Key elements that determine success in achieving the goal; - Power characteristics of the impact on the target; - The conditions for the most effective impact of instruments are not the re-sulting indicators: the way, direction and nature of the impact, the ability to adapt instruments to changing conditions. Any tool used to achieve the goals in the field of energy conservation and energy efficiency has certain characteristics. The set of characteristics of any instrument is standard, but in different types of regions it will appear in different ways. As a result, several tools with dif-ferent characteristics and a combination of these characteristics in the group will give a synergistic effect that will increase the effectiveness of achieving the goals set with the least cost.

Better Life Index is a newly designed tool which provides a comprehensive picture of well-being in OECD countries and other major economies, by looking at people's material conditions and quality of life across the population. The index is based on twenty-four indicators grouped in eleven topics concerning housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic engagement, health, life satisfaction, safety and work-life balance. However, the OECD does not rank countries by the Better Life Index. Instead, users are encouraged to assign and share their own weights for the topics to design a composite indicator that can express their preferences on the contribution of each topic to well-being. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the benefit of doubt approach to the construction of a composite index of well-being based on the eleven topics. By this approach, we assign to each country individual weights for the topics that can emphasize the strengths of the country in people's material conditions and quality of life.

To solve this problem, the author worked out a new tool in the form of a modified production function (PF) with variable parameters, based on the hypothesis of the variability of the rate of economic growth due to technical progress. Using modified PF lets reduce to a common base year the source data and estimate the PF for non-homogeneity periods which have both the periods of growth and decline. In the analysis, interest is not represented by the average annual contribution of production factors to product growth, but by the direct contribution of variable factors to product growth. The same result can be achieved both due to the extensive growth of production factors, and due to their qualitative growth. The developed by author tool lets evaluate intensive production factors contribution to output increase and determine the efficiency of development of the national economy. Verification of developed approach is shown by the example of the economic development of the USA. The development of the economy of the U.S. was predominantly intensive.

The issues related to the approaches and methods of financial risk assessment, designed to prevent the negative consequences were addressed in the works of Russian and foreign scientists. However, certain schemes, algorithms, methods, models and, approaches to the analysis and assessment of financial risks still remain to be poorly developed. In this view, there is emerging need for the development of a mechanism which would allow assessing the existing financial risks based on the available information sources. The above-mentioned factors render the topic of the current work highly relevant. In the present work we define in detail the concept of financial risks and provide the classification of financial risks. The approaches and methods currently used to assess financial risks are analyzed. We report further the development of the integrated matrix assessment method to estimate the risks of financial equilibrium disturbance. We highlight the potential advantages and drawbacks of this method, describe the key steps in the development and implementation of the discussed matrix method, and justify the choice of the indicator system on which the method is based. The practical relevance of the work is determined by the versatility of the proposed matrix diagnostic analysis method which may be used both in financial risk management to forecast financial insolvency and assess the risk of bankruptcy and in audit to provide support for the continuity assumption when carrying out the analytical review procedures. The results of the work were applied to 15 vine producers in the Krasnodar Krai. A more close analysis is provided for Lefkadia LLC.","[Naniz, K. R.; Martynova, T. A.; Deynega, V.

In spite of frequent usage of this term in the literature and acknowledged importance in management practice, the well-grounded methodology for the effectiveness has been missing. The generic view of effectiveness explained as doing right things underpins the suggested methodology. Basing on this, the focus in the measurement is shifted from the weighted absolute values of criteria to the weighted inter-criteria proportions.

However, the fact is that different players may be asymmetric and contribute to different efforts, bargaining powers, or stability in the process of cooperation. A weight vector is used to reflect players' asymmetry. In view of these weights are possible to be less than 1, that is, not all players are absolutely important, a loss of dividends of coalitions can happen. We define and characterize a reduced Harsanyi power solution for cooperative games with a weight vector, which is relevant to a loss function of dividends.

It is explained by the fact that due to unfavorable development factors in these regions, it is most difficult to ensure economic and social growth, to carry out infrastructure development, to attract external financing and investments. Depressive regions tend to have a low level of competitiveness and a prolonged economic decline in industrial production, accompanied by an increase in unemployment. The development of such regions is impossible without external intervention. Specialists in the regional economy have described indicators of such regions. They are: the rate of change in industrial production, the level of unemployment, the size of the gross regional product per capita, the industrial output per capita. It is necessary to attract investment in the economy of depressed regions in order to bring their economies to the stage of sustainable growth. It is possible due to the development of the innovation sphere. A key element of the innovative sphere of any region is its innovative infrastructure. In this connection, the analysis of the state and the definition of promising areas for the development of the innovation infrastructure of the depressed regions is an urgent and significant scientific task. The article analyzes the existing state of the innovation infrastructure of ten constituent entities of the Russian Federation, which are considered to be depressive. The authors use the method of understanding factual data, the index method, the method of comparisons and the method of expert evaluations.

It is a common practice that the both supply and demand of some actors can be indeterminate as well as the evaluation of routes between them in terms of distance and time. There are ways to deal with uncertainty in the linear optimization models such as stochastic optimization or interval programming. These approaches bring also computational difficulties since their practical application is quite demanding. We show how this situation can be handled using robust optimization approach towards modelling of uncertainty. The robust approach is a tool that seeks a robust-optimal solution and it allows, in its extended form, to specify the deviations from deterministic values quite precisely while the entire mathematical model remains simple which is a considerable computational advantage. The way of transformation of transportation problem into its robust counterpart is described in detail and accompanied by example of different scenarios in the end.","[Hlavaty, Robert; Brozova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Hlavaty, R (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",hlavaty@pef.czu.cz; brozova@pef.czu.cz,"Hlavatý, Robert/C-7653-2017; Brozova, Helena/K-2834-2017","Hlavatý, Robert/0000-0001-6136-8739; Brozova, Helena/0000-0002-0322-251X",,,,,15,3,3,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,225,230,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400039,0

Uncertainty is captured by a Markov chain with countable infinite state space. In each period only a finite number of states occur with a positive probability. Finite sets of single period feasible actions and single period payoffs from them depend only on the current state. A strategy assigns to each state a feasible action at it. An epsilon-optimal strategy gives the sum of discounted expected single period payoffs that is no lower than its maximum on the set of strategies minus epsilon. Since the state space is infinite, an epsilon-optimal solution to the program is open-ended. We develop an algorithm that generates (for a chosen small positive epsilon) an epsilon-optimal solution gradually. It gives for each state the prescription for it that is ex ante epsilon-optimal, without specifying prescriptions for other states. It is based on critical periods. A critical period of a current state is the first period with the property that expected payoff in it cannot affect epsilon-optimality of action at the current state.","[Horniacek, Milan] Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Econ, Mlynske Luhy 4, SK-82105 Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Horniacek, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Social & Econ Sci, Inst Econ, Mlynske Luhy 4, SK-82105 Bratislava, Slovakia.",milan.horniacek@fses.uniba.sk,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,236,241,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400041,0

The aim of the paper is to assess the co-movement between bank loans and credit standards in Euro Area via moving and dynamic correlation and also from the wavelet co-spectrum perspectives. We use quarterly data over the period 2003/Q1-2016/Q1. We conclude that banks originated fewer loans after they tightened lending standards. However, the co-movement was more apparent in case of households when the level of new loans provided by banks was lower after the lending standards tightening (and vice versa). In case of enterprises, the behaviour of banks concerning credit standards and the loans to enterprises was more unstable. In both cases, the co-movement is characterised by short-term reactions rather than long-term trend. However, the reactions changed in two years after the financial crisis of 2007 and then in 2011when banks started following their credit standards and limited the level of new loans.","[Kucerova, Zuzana; Pomenkova, Jitka] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Tech 12, Brno 61600, Czech Republic; [Kucerova, Zuzana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Mendel University in Brno,"Pomenková, J (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Tech 12, Brno 61600, Czech Republic.",pomenkaj@feec.vutbr.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262",Czech Science Foundation [17-24309S]; Czech Ministry of Education [LO1401],"Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","The research described in the paper was supported by the Czech Science Foundation via grant n. 17-24309S and by the Czech Ministry of Education in the frame of National Sustainability Program under grant LO1401.

Two refrigerated vehicles (one rigid and one articulated), two food products (one chilled and one frozen), and three delivery schedules (long multi-drop delivery, continuous multi-drop delivery, and short delivery) are used for assessment purposes. The analysis indicates that for all cases investigated more cryogenic fluid is required for food transport refrigeration compared to the quantity of diesel. For all delivery schedules, the Well to Wheel environmental impacts of cryogenic systems will be of the same order as those of diesel driven refrigeration systems. Uncertainty of diesel and cryogenic prices in the future makes investment in cryogenic systems difficult on economic grounds alone, and the unavailability of charging infrastructure currently hinders the use of cryogenic refrigeration systems for long distance transportation.

While the Black-Scholes model assumes that the volatility of the asset is constant or a deterministic function, the Heston model assumes that the volatility is a random process. The explicit solution for the Heston model is unavailable for many types of options and therefore numerical methods have been proposed for pricing options under Heston model, e.g. Monte Carlo method, the finite difference method, the finite element method or the discontinuous Galerkin method. The Heston model is represented by a parabolic equation. For its efficient numerical solution, we use the theta scheme for the time discretization and we propose an adaptive wavelet method for the discretization of the equation on the given time level. We construct a piecewise linear wavelet basis and use it in the scheme. The advantage of wavelets is their compression property. It means that the representation of the solution in a wavelet basis requires a small number of coefficients and the computation of the solution can be performed with the small number of parameters. Numerical example is presented for the European put option.","[Cerna, Dana] Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Cerná, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",dana.cerna@tul.cz,"Černá, Dana/D-5913-2012","Černá, Dana/0000-0003-3259-8919",Czech Science Foundation [GA16-09541S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by grant No. GA16-09541S of the Czech Science Foundation.,,17,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,96,101,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400017,0

Traditional game theory is divided into non-cooperative and cooperative models. Biform games combine non-cooperative and cooperative models. The goal of coopetition is to move the players from a zero-sum game to a plus-sum game, a scenario in which the end result is more profitable when the competitors work together. The paper presents game theory models that represent the co-opetition concept. The coopetition business model has PARTS of a business strategy - five dimensions a company can use to identify strategies that change the game: Players, Added value, Rules, Tactics, and Scope. The players are the firm, customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors, competitors whose products add value. An important part of the game is to learn which conditions will influence the players to either compete or cooperate.","[Fiala, Petr] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fiala, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pfiala@vse.cz,"Fiala, Petr/K-6823-2015",,"DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/G097]; Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/57/2017]","DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic; Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the grant No. P402/12/G097 (DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic and by the grant No. IGA F4/57/2017, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,21,0,0,0,10,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,167,172,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400029,0

Using the public data from the accounting statements from the last 15 years we have formulated and estimated a panel data model using various real and financial indicators of the Czech companies. The most significant factors are the size of companies, the ratio of non-current assets to total assets, the rentability of assets, the ratio of inventory to the total assets, the economic activity classification CZ-NACE, and the legal form. We show that the influence of the indebtedness ratio is non-linear. Surprisingly, the company's age and the retained losses prior years have no effects on final effective tax rates.

The rates are assumed to include imprecision of information used by investor to make a financial decision, that is data which may possibly be faulty or incomplete. In the presented paper imprecision is understood as ambiguity and vagueness of information, and stems from investor's subjectivity as well as technical and technological premises. Previous research shows, that measures of ambiguity and vagueness should be calculated for discount factors rather than for return rates from a portfolio. Means of appointing the measures and some interesting conclusions about the relationship between portfolio construction and imprecision are stated throughout the paper. Finally, numerical example presenting model characteristics and exemplary calculation of portfolio fuzzy discount factor is given.","[Siwek, Joanna] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Siwek, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Poznan, Poland.",joanna.siwek@ue.poznan.pl,"Siwek, Joanna/ABD-8633-2020","Siwek, Joanna/0000-0002-7889-4505",National Science Centre Poland [2015/17/N/HS4/00206],"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The article is financed by the National Science Centre Poland, grant No. 2015/17/N/HS4/00206.",,23,3,3,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7435-678-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,661,666,,,,,,6,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ7ED,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427151400113,0

The mission of engineering education having been interpreted in different ways in various historical periods, according to the existing system of values, made teaching approaches different as well. As a result, engineering education in Russia featured a number of reforms that gave the priority in teaching to either an ideological aspect with a lot of political disciplines in a curriculum (the early 1920s) or a branch approach when highly specialized teaching was introduced to the detriment of theoretical knowledge (the early 1930s). Though the significance of vocational practices was realized at all historical stages of engineering education in the Russian Far East, their forms and methods varied in different time. The conclusion is made about the highest level of their organization in the 1980s. The local higher schools had strong connections with the industry getting the opportunity to send students to leading enterprises throughout the USSR. The author analyses also some new trends in organizing students' vocational practices using the examples of the Vladivostok University of Economics and Services. The paper is based on the unpublished archival documents on the Far Eastern higher school activity in 1920-1980s.","[Khisamutdinova, N.] Vladivostok Univ Econ & Serv VSUES, Dept Cross Cultural Commun, Vladivostok, Russia",Vladivostok State University of Economics & Services,"Khisamutdinova, N (通讯作者)，Vladivostok Univ Econ & Serv VSUES, Dept Cross Cultural Commun, Vladivostok, Russia.",natalya.khisamutdinova@vvsu.ru,"Khisamutdinova, Natalia/AAE-4846-2022",,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-656-3,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,47.0,,,,,,1205,1209,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Operations Research & Management Science,BR9NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000679066800273,0

Two methods based on this approach are proposed. In one of them the innovation activity intensity is measured via decomposition of the labor productivity increase into the factors that generate it - the dynamics of capital productivity ratio and capital-labor ratio (in logarithms). Another methodical approach closely connected with the previous one is based on the special parameter, characterizing investment potential growth, the demand for the net investments to increase unit intensity productivity. Calculations made on US statistics since the early 1960s give an idea of the innovation factor role in certain quantitative assessments. It turned out that in general for the period 1961-2014 about 3/4 of the productivity increase is due to the capital-labor ratio growth, and only 1/4 to the capital productivity ratio growth. In 1981-2000 about half of the productivity increase was already obtained due to the innovation factor; investment, which provided breakthrough technologies. At the same time, a reduction in the relative demand for investment from the beginning of the 1980s made it possible with almost the same accumulation rate to stop the threatening tendency towards reducing of the labor productivity growth rates.","[Lavrovskiy, B.

An inseparable part of the process of the liberalization is the strengthening of the competitive fight between national and foreign producers which often result in the manifestation of the unfair competition from the part of foreign counterparts in the form of price discrimination of domestic goods. Under such conditions an important challenge for the national economy is the achievement of a definite balance between the protectionist measures and the tools of free trade. The mentioned problems have acquired an additional relevance after the joining the World Trade Organization by Russia and after the growth of integration processes in the post soviet space within the Eurasian partnership. In the current situation the optimal mechanism which allows on the one hand to observe the national economic interests of Russia and on the other not to violate international agreements is the system of non-tariff barriers.

In recent development of many economies, interest rate hit the zero lower bound, making traditional instrument of monetary policy unemployable. Depreciation of country's currency and subsequent interventions on FX market therefore provide for an option for inflation targeting in small open economies. We use a New-Keynesian dynamic stochastic model of general equilibrium. The possibility of central bank's interventions is modeled by adding a segment of FX dealers as a modified uncovered interest parity condition, according to [2]. The model is then estimated on data of Czech economy. We then introduce non-linearities to otherwise linear model, providing a way to model constraints on variables. Constraint on interest rate is chosen to model the position of the economy at zero lower bound, whereas constraint on exchange rate is used to model commitment of central bank to keep exchange rate above certain value. Model is solved using toolbox of [3], which introduces a way of dealing with non-linear models, by assuming perfect foresight of agents.

Uncertainty is understood as a state of vagueness that does not provide a decision-maker with any guidance to construct rational estimates; only possible ranges of input values are known. A typical representative of such a system is a solar photovoltaic power plant, by means of which the research findings are demonstrated. The basic idea of the herein presented approach is the thesis that in terms of uncertainty there is a much greater chance to correctly predict the intervals at which the respective point values are found than to correctly estimate a single point value. Within this argument the relevant formulas are translated from the language of arithmetic to the language of intervals. In it the significant points of the interval of profitability values are derived, which, in addition to standard information about the profitability of investments (standard IRR), also provide information about the measure of investment safety (in terms of resistance against possible financial loss) and the measure of hope for a premium assessment.

Phosphorus (P) is crucial to plant growth and mineral fertilizer is added to soil to maintain P concentrations, however this is a finite resource, thus efficient use is critical. Plants primarily uptake P from a labile (available) P pool and not from the stable solid phase; transfer between these pools limits bioavailability. Transfer is controlled by soil properties which vary between soil types. The dynamic phosphorus pool simulator (DPPS) quantifies crop production and soil P relationships by utilising the transfer. This approach effectively models crop uptake from soil inputs, but it does not quantify the efficiency use. This study incorporates geochemical techniques within DPPS to quantify the efficiency of fertilizer-P use based on soil chemistry. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Its design (based on life-cycle principles) brings the customer demand (number, type and timings of meals served) during typical, peak and special weeks together with the food storage, warewashing, ventilation, cooking and hot holding appliance capacities, carbon emissions and energy usage in various states. An assessment of separate and specific behavioural, equipment maintenance, preparation and cooking strategies are performed. The baseline energy use results were validated to within 0.65% of the findings from an extensive and detailed monitoring study of a leading operator of UK public houses and restaurants Pt Seven energy reduction scenarios were then assessed using the developed calculator. Potential energy savings of 58% (195 MWh) and emissions savings of 46% (55,224 kgCO(2)e) per year were indicated from replacing the chargrill, fryers and microwave combi ovens with two combi steam ovens and reducing freezing demand in the case study restaurant. This scenario projects reductions in energy use of 37.77 million kWh (2 pound million) per year for the whole restaurant chain and up to 346 million kWh (18.3 pound million) if applied to the whole case study organisation.

Supermarkets are intensive energy consumers and approximately the 40% of their annual energy consumption is for refrigeration. Direct emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the use of high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants, and the indirect impact on the environment related to high electrical energy consumption, make shopping malls not sustainable buildings. This paper analyses the energy saving potential of integrated supermarket air conditioning and refrigeration systems using a Water Loop Heat Pump system (WLHP). A basic CO2 booster commercial refrigeration system, applied to cold rooms and display cabinets, is considered. Heat recovery from the refrigeration circuit is performed in the heating season, while in the cooling season a dry cooler on the water loop allows heat rejection to outdoors. The building and all systems are modelled in the Trnsys environment taking into account the hourly weather data, the simulated daily profiles of the cooling and heating load demand and the request from refrigerated food storage equipment. Such a model allows a thorough understanding of the potential for energy savings with heat recovery solutions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Producers of manufacturing products place their factories disproportionally in the Czech Republic. Therefore the impact on regional economy is different. However, the production of manufacturing products requires lots of different inputs and therefore the links between regions are tighter that can be directly observable. Moreover, the inputs for manufacturing industry contain also services and the distribution of created value added is more complex. The aim of the paper is to analyse the links in Czech manufacturing industries using regional input-output tables for fourteen regions of the Czech Republic. These tables were compiled for 2013. By the Newton gravity method, they were arranged into the inter-regional model as a matrix with 1148 rows and columns.

When the system is operating in transcritical cycle the heat exchanger at the high-pressure side of the system is well known as gas cooler. The gas cooler rejects heat from the superheated refrigerant gas to ambient air without condensation in single phase heat transfer process. The understanding of its performance parameters under different conditions and control strategies is essential to adequately design and optimise for specific applications. In this paper, a detailed mathematical model is developed in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) platform, and validated with experimental results obtained from a test rig at the National Centre for Sustainable Energy use in Food Chains (CSEF). The model is investigated two different gas cooler designs when separately installed and test into a CO2 refrigeration system, an attempt to formulate the design guidelines for CO2 gas coolers. Then the detailed gas cooler models were integrated with the CO2 refrigeration system model to investigate the effects of the gas cooler design into system COP. Parameters such as intermediate pressure, evaporating temperature and cooling capacity were defined from the experimental results and then inserted to the model. The results of the detailed gas cooler model and CO2 refrigeration system model were validated against the experimental test results based on the gas cooler performance and overall system performance.

In our model there are n agents and each agent strategically chooses when to join a first-come-first-served observable queue. Agents dislike standing in line and they take actions in discrete time steps: we assume that each agent has a cost of 1 for every time step he waits before joining the queue and a cost of w > 1 for every time step he waits in the queue. At each time step a single agent can be processed. Before each time step, every agent observes the queue and strategically decides whether or not to join, with the goal of minimizing his expected cost. In this paper we focus on symmetric strategies which are arguably more natural as they require less coordination. This brings up the following twist to the usual price of anarchy question: what is the main source for the inefficiency of symmetric equilibria? is it the players' strategic behavior or the lack of coordination? We present results for two different parameter regimes that are qualitatively very different: (i) when w is fixed and n grows, we prove a tight bound of 2 and show that the entire loss is due to the players' selfish behavior (ii) when n is fixed and w grows, we prove a tight bound of Theta (root w/n) and show that it is mainly due to lack of coordination: the same order of magnitude of loss is suffered by any symmetric profile.","[Babaioff, Moshe] Microsoft Res, Herzliyya, Israel; [Oren, Sigal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Oren, S (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.",moshe@microsoft.com; sigal3@gmail.com,,"Oren, Sigal/0000-0002-4271-7291",,,,,31,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,37,50,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_3,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000003,0

Specifically, we focus on the case where the agents are allowed to submit strict weak orders and we try to address the following questions from the perspective of a market-designer: (i) How can a designer generate matchings that are robust-in the sense that they are good with respect to the underlying unknown true orders? (ii) What is the trade-off between the amount of missing information and the quality of solution one can get? With the goal of resolving these questions through a simple and prior-free approach, we suggest looking at matchings that minimize the maximum number of blocking pairs with respect to all the possible underlying true orders as a measure of goodness or quality, and subsequently provide results on finding such matchings. In particular, we first restrict our attention to matchings that have to be stable with respect to at least one of the completions (i.e., weakly-stable matchings) and show that in this case arbitrarily filling-in the missing information and computing the resulting stable matching can give a non-trivial approximation factor for our problem in certain cases. We complement this result by showing that, even under severe restrictions on the preferences of the agents, the factor obtained is asymptotically tight in many cases. We then investigate a special case, where only agents on one side provide strict weak orders and all the missing information is at the bottom of their preference orders, and show that in this special case the negative result mentioned above can be circumvented in order to get a much better approximation factor; this result, too, is tight in many cases. Finally, we move away from the restriction on weakly-stable matchings and show a general hardness of approximation result and also discuss one possible approach that can lead us to a near-tight approximation bound.","[Menon, Vijay; Larson, Kate] Univ Waterloo, David R Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Menon, V (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, David R Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",vijay.menon@uwaterloo.ca; kate.larson@uwaterloo.ca,,"Larson, Kate/0000-0002-5455-9657",,,,,21,3,3,2,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,341,355,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_23,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000023,0

The budget feasible mechanism design problem requires the design a mechanism which incentivizes the sellers to truthfully report their cost and maximizes the buyer's value while guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget feasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her. This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in 2010. We consider the general case where the buyer's valuation is a monotone submodular function. There are a number of truthful mechanisms known for this problem. We offer two general frameworks for simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly improve on the best known results, while also simplifying the analysis. For example, we improve the approximation guarantee for the general monotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets (where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More generally, given an r approximation algorithm for the optimization problem (ignoring incentives), our mechanism is a r + 1 approximation mechanism for large markets, an improvement from 2r(2). We also provide a mechanism without the large market assumption, where we achieve a 4r + 1 approximation guarantee. We also show how our results can be used for the problem of a principal hiring in a Crowdsourcing Market to select a set of tasks subject to a total budget.","[Khalilabadi, Pooya Jalaly; Tardos, Eva] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Khalilabadi, PJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jalaly@cs.cornell.edu; eva@cs.cornell.edu,,,"NSF [CCF-1563714, CCF-1422102]; ONR [N00014-08-1-0031]; Google Research Grant",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated),"P.

We introduce the combinatorial assortment problem, where each customer may select a bundle of products. We consider a choice model in which each consumer selects a utility-maximizing bundle subject to a private valuation function, and study the complexity of the resulting optimization problem. Our main result is an exact algorithm for k-additive valuations, under a model of vertical differentiation in which customers agree on the relative value of each pair of items but differ in their absolute willingness to pay. For valuations that are vertically differentiated but not necessarily k-additive, we show how to obtain constant approximations under a well-priced condition, where each product's price is sufficiently high. We further show that even for a single customer with known valuation, any sub-polynomial approximation to the problem requires exponentially many demand queries when the valuation function is XOS, and that no FPTAS exists even when the valuation is succinctly representable.","[Immorlica, Nicole; Lucier, Brendan; Syrgkanis, Vasilis] Microsoft Res, Boston, MA USA; [Mao, Jieming] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tzamos, Christos] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",Microsoft; University of Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Mao, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",nicimm@microsoft.com; brlucier@microsoft.com; maojm517@gmail.com; vasy@microsoft.com; ctzamos@gmail.com,,"Tzamos, Christos/0000-0002-7560-5069",,,,,17,3,3,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,218,231,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_15,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000015,0

Our main theorem is a sampling theorem, similar to those that have been proved for approximate equilibria in normal form games. It states that if an ETR problem has an exact solution, then it has a k-uniform approximate solution, where k depends on various properties of the formula.

Previous work has shown that several well-known tournament solutions almost never rule out any alternative in large random tournaments. Nevertheless, all analytical results thus far have assumed a rigid probabilistic model, in which either a tournament is chosen uniformly at random, or there is a linear order of alternatives and the orientation of all edges in the tournament is chosen with the same probabilities according to the linear order. In this work, we consider a significantly more general model where the orientation of different edges can be chosen with different probabilities. We show that a number of common tournament solutions, including the top cycle and the uncovered set, are still unlikely to rule out any alternative under this model. This corresponds to natural graph-theoretic conditions such as irreducibility of the tournament.

This paper introduces a generalization of Byzantine agreement, where the input values of the nodes are preference rankings of three or more candidates. We show that consensus on preferences, which is an important question in social choice theory, complements already known results from Byzantine agreement. In addition, preferential voting raises new questions about how to approximate consensus vectors. We propose a deterministic algorithm to solve Byzantine agreement on rankings under a generalized validity condition, which we call ParetoValidity. These results are then extended by considering a special voting rule which chooses the Kemeny median as the consensus vector. For this rule, we derive a lower bound on the approximation ratio of the Kemeny median that can be guaranteed by any deterministic algorithm. We then provide an algorithm matching this lower bound. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial generalization of multi-valued Byzantine agreement to multiple dimensions which can tolerate a constant fraction of Byzantine nodes.","[Melnyk, Darya; Wang, Yuyi; Wattenhofer, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Melnyk, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",dmelnyk@ethz.ch; yuwang@ethz.ch; wattenhofer@ethz.ch,"Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023","Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Melnyk, Darya/0000-0001-5614-8563",,,,,39,3,3,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,327,340,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_22,0.0,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000022,0

We are interested in simple and natural variants of the FJ model that use limited information exchange in each round and converge to the same stable point. As in the FJ model, we assume that each agent i has an intrinsic opinion si is an element of [0, 1] and maintains an expressed opinion x(i)(t) is an element of [0, 1] in each round t. To model limited information exchange, we assume that each agent i meets with one random friend j at each round t and learns only x(j)(t). The amount of influence j imposes on i is reflected by the probability p(ij) with which i meets j. Then, agent i suffers a disagreement cost that is a convex combination of (x(i)(t) - s(i))(2) and (x(i)(t) - x(j)(t))(2). An important class of dynamics in this setting are no regret dynamics. We show an exponential gap between the convergence rate of no regret dynamics and of more general dynamics that do not ensure no regret. We prove that no regret dynamics require roughly Omega(1/epsilon) rounds to be within distance e from the stable point x* of the FJ model. On the other hand, we provide an opinion update rule that does not ensure no regret and converges to x* in (O) over tilde (log(2)(1/epsilon)) rounds.

Much like in nature, where-fluid mechanics teaches us-liquid maintains an equal level in connected vessels, so do we seek to control the flow of votes in a way that balances influence as much as possible. Specifically, we analyze the problem of choosing delegations to approximately minimize the maximum number of votes entrusted to any agent, by drawing connections to the literature on confluent flow.

We study both social welfare and profit maximization with revealed preferences. Although social welfare maximization is a seemingly non-convex optimization problem in prices, we show that (i) it can be reduced to a dual convex optimization problem in prices, and (ii) the revealed preferences can be interpreted as supergradients of the concave conjugate of valuation, with which subgradients of the dual function can be computed. We thereby obtain a simple subgradient-based algorithm for strongly concave valuations and convex cost, with query complexity O(m(2)/epsilon(2)), where epsilon is the additive difference between the social welfare induced by our algorithm and the optimum social welfare. We also study social welfare maximization under the online setting, specifically the random permutation model, where consumers arrive one-by-one in a random order. For the case where consumer valuations can be arbitrary continuous functions, we propose a price posting mechanism that achieves an expected social welfare up to an additive factor of O(root mn) from the maximum social welfare. Finally, for profit maximization (which may be non-convex in simple cases), we give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the query complexity for separable valuations and cost (i.e., each good can be treated independently).","[Ji, Ziwei; Mehta, Ruta; Telgarsky, Matus] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ji, ZW (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",ziweiji2@illinois.edu; rutameht@illinois.edu; mjt@illinois.edu,,,,,,,36,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,264,281,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_18,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000018,0

To maximize the value provided to auction participants, spending is smoothed across auctions so budgets are used for the best opportunities. Motivated by a mechanism used in practice by several companies, this paper considers a smoothing procedure that relies on pacing multipliers: on behalf of each bidder, the auction market applies a factor between 0 and 1 that uniformly scales the bids across all auctions. Reinterpreting this process as a game between bidders, we introduce the notion of pacing equilibrium, and prove that they are always guaranteed to exist. We demonstrate through examples that a market can have multiple pacing equilibria with large variations in several natural objectives. We show that pacing equilibria refine another popular solution concept, competitive equilibria, and show further connections between the two solution concepts. Although we show that computing either a social-welfare-maximizing or a revenuemaximizing pacing equilibrium is NP-hard, we present a mixed-integer program (MIP) that can be used to find equilibria optimizing several relevant objectives. We use the MIP to provide evidence that: (1) equilibrium multiplicity occurs very rarely across several families of random instances, (2) static MIP solutions can be used to improve the outcomes achieved by a dynamic pacing algorithm with instances based on a realworld auction market, and (3) for our instances, bidders do not have an incentive to misreport bids or budgets provided there are enough participants in the auction.","[Conitzer, Vincent] Econorithms LLC, Durham, NC USA; [Conitzer, Vincent] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Kroer, Christian; Sodomka, Eric; Stier-Moses, Nicolas E.] Facebook Inc, Core Data Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Duke University; Facebook Inc,"Kroer, C (通讯作者)，Facebook Inc, Core Data Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",vincent.conitzer@duke.edu; chrkroer@fb.com; sodomka@fb.com; nstier@fb.com,"Stier-Moses, Nicolas/R-5236-2018","Stier-Moses, Nicolas/0000-0001-6380-1516; Kroer, Christian/0000-0002-9009-8683",,,,,0,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,443,443,,,,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000030,0

This is an important consideration in settings such as crowdsourcing competitions, open science challenges and group-based assignments, where a large number of agents organize themselves into small teams which then compete against each other. A central tension here is between the strategic interests of agents who want to have the highest-performing team, and that of the principal who wants teams to be balanced. Moreover, although the principal cannot choose the teams or modify rewards, she often has additional knowledge of agents' abilities, and can leverage this information asymmetry to provide signals that influence team formation. Our work uncovers the critical role of self-awareness (i.e., knowledge of one's own abilities) for the design of such mechanisms. For settings with two-member teams and binary-valued agents, we provide signaling mechanisms which are asymptotically optimal when agents are agnostic of their own abilities.

Somewhat surprisingly, we show that the original tight prophet inequality bounds comparing the single-pricing with the optimum offline are tight even when we use the optimum online as a benchmark, both for the identical and non-identical distributions. Moreover, we incorporate linear programming to characterize this benchmark, and show how this approach leads to a modular way of designing prophet inequalities, hence reconstructing the results of [31] and [13] with somewhat simpler proofs.","[Niazadeh, Rad] Stanford Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Saberi, Amin; Shameli, Ali] Stanford Univ, Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Niazadeh, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rad@cs.stanford.edu; saberi@stanford.edu; shameli@stanford.edu,,"Niazadeh, Rad/0000-0002-5880-6221",,,,,32,2,3,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,356,374,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_24,0.0,,,19,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000024,0

In this paper we seek to identify structural properties of instances of stable matching problems which will allow us to design efficient algorithms using elementary techniques. We focus on the setting in which all agents involved in some matching problem can be partitioned into k different types, where the type of an agent determines his or her preferences, and agents have preferences over types (which may be refined by more detailed preferences within a single type). This situation would arise in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small collection of agents' attributes. We also consider a generalisation in which each agent may consider some small collection of other agents to be exceptional, and rank these in a way that is not consistent with their types; this could happen in practice if agents have prior contact with a small number of candidates. We show that (for the case without exceptions), the well-known NP-hard matching problem Max SMTI (that of finding the maximum cardinality stable matching in an instance of stable marriage with ties and incomplete lists) belongs to the parameterised complexity class FPT when parameterised by the number of different types of agents needed to describe the instance. This tractability result can be extended to the setting in which each agent promotes at most one exceptional candidate to the top of his/her list (when preferences within types are not refined), but the problem remains NP-hard if preference lists can contain two or more exceptions and the exceptional candidates can be placed anywhere in the preference lists.","[Meeks, Kitty] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Rastegari, Baharak] Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Glasgow; University of Southampton,"Rastegari, B (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.",kitty.meeks@glasgow.ac.uk; b.rastegari@soton.ac.uk,,"Rastegari, Baharak/0000-0002-0985-573X; Meeks, Kitty/0000-0001-5299-3073",Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Government),Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Government),The first author is supported by a Personal Research Fellowship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh (funded by the Scottish Government).

However, this result relies heavily on the assumption that buyers are indifferent to risk. In this paper we investigate the case where the buyers are risk-loving, i.e. they prefer gambling to being rewarded deterministically. We use the standard model for risk from expected utility theory, where risk-loving behavior is represented by a convex utility function. We focus our attention on the special case of exponential utility functions. We characterize the optimal auction and show that randomization can be used to extract more revenue than when buyers are risk-neutral. Most importantly, we show that the optimal auction is simple: the optimal revenue can be extracted using a randomized take-it-or-leave-it price for a single buyer and using a loser-pay auction, a variant of the all-pay auction, for multiple buyers. Finally, we show that these results no longer hold for convex utility functions beyond exponential.","[Nikolova, Evdokia; Pountourakis, Emmanouil; Yang, Ger] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Pountourakis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",manolis@utexas.edu,,"Nikolova, Evdokia/0000-0002-8801-0320",,,,,18,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,375,392,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_25,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000025,0

Such games are central in formal verification since they model the interaction between a non-terminating system and its environment. We study bidding games in which the players bid for the right to move the token. Two bidding rules have been defined. In Richman bidding, in each round, the players simultaneously submit bids, and the higher bidder moves the token and pays the other player. Poorman bidding is similar except that the winner of the bidding pays the bank rather than the other player. While poorman reachability games have been studied before, we present, for the first time, results on infinite-duration poorman games. A central quantity in these games is the ratio between the two players' initial budgets. The questions we study concern a necessary and sufficient ratio with which a player can achieve a goal. For reachability objectives, such threshold ratios are known to exist for both bidding rules. We show that the properties of poorman reachability games extend to complex qualitative objectives such as parity, similarly to the Richman case. Our most interesting results concern quantitative poorman games, namely poorman mean-payoff games, where we construct optimal strategies depending on the initial ratio, by showing a connection with random-turn based games. The connection in itself is interesting, because it does not hold for reachability poorman games. We also solve the complexity problems that arise in poorman bidding games.","[Avni, Guy; Henzinger, Thomas A.] IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Ibsen-Jensen, Rasmus] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Institute of Science & Technology - Austria; University of Liverpool,"Avni, G (通讯作者)，IST Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.",guy.avni@ist.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [S11402-N23, Z211-N23, M 2369-N33]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [M2369] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This research was supported in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under grants S11402-N23 (RiSE/SHiNE), Z211-N23 (Wittgenstein Award), and M 2369-N33 (Meitner fellowship).",,36,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,21,36,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_2,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000002,0

We form new algorithms to do this in the presence of only ordinal information, i.e., when the true costs or distances from the agents to the facilities are unknown, and only the ordinal preferences of the agents for the facilities are available. The main difference between our work and previous work in this area is that while we assume that only ordinal information about agent preferences is known, we know the exact locations of the possible facilities F. Due to this extra information about the facilities, we are able to form powerful algorithms which have small distortion, i.e., perform almost as well as omniscient algorithms but use only ordinal information about agent preferences. For example, we present natural social choice mechanisms for choosing a single facility to open with distortion of at most 3 for minimizing both the total and the median social cost; this factor is provably the best possible. We analyze many general problems including matching, k-center, and k-median, and present black-box reductions from omniscient approximation algorithms with approximation factor beta to ordinal algorithms with approximation factor 1+ 2 beta; doing this gives new ordinal algorithms for many important problems, and establishes a toolkit for analyzing such problems in the future.","[Anshelevich, Elliot; Zhu, Wennan] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Anshelevich, E; Zhu, WN (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",eanshel@cs.rpi.edu; zhuw5@rpi.edu,,,NSF [CCF-1527497],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Onkar Bhardwaj for discussion of the lower bound example for the k-median problem.

For myopic agents, proper scoring rules induce truthfulness. However, when agents have multiple opportunities for revealing information, and take into account long-term effects of their actions, deception and reticence may appear. Such situations have been described in the literature. No simple rules exist to distinguish between the truthful and the untruthful situations, and a determination has been done in isolated cases only. This is of relevance to prediction markets, where the market value is a common prediction, and more generally in informal public prediction forums, such as stock-market estimates by analysts. We describe three different mechanisms that are strategy-proof with non-myopic considerations, and show that one of them, a discounted market scoring rule, meets all our requirements from a mechanism in almost all prediction settings. To illustrate, we extensively analyze a prediction setting with continuous outcomes, and show how our suggested mechanism restores prompt truthfulness where incumbent mechanisms fail.","[Ban, Amir] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Ban, A (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, Haifa, Israel.",amirban@netvision.net.il,,,,,,,15,1,2,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04612-5; 978-3-030-04611-8,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11316.0,,,,,,51,65,,10.1007/978-3-030-04612-5_4,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BT9YK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000865933000004,0

An instance of the game consists of a single server and a set of unit-length jobs. Every job needs to be processed along a specified time interval, defined by its release-time and due-date. Jobs may also have variable weights, which specify the amount of resource they require. We assume that jobs are controlled by selfish agents who act to minimize their own cost, rather than to optimize any global objective. The jobs processed in a specific time-slot cover the server's activation cost in this slot, with the cost being shared proportionally to the jobs' weights. Known result on cost-sharing games do not exploit the special interval-structure of the strategy space in our game, and are therefore not tight. We present a complete analysis of equilibrium existence, computation, and inefficiency in real-time scheduling cost-sharing games.

Therefore, this paper describes ongoing research dealing with the exploitation of news contained sentiment to improve microblog sentiment classification in a financial context.","[Daudert, Tobias; Buitelaar, Paul; Negi, Sapna] Natl Univ Ireland, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Data Sci Inst, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Daudert, T (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Data Sci Inst, Galway, Ireland.",tobias.daudert@insight-centre.org; paul.buitelaar@insight-centre.org; sapna.negi@insight-centre.org,"Negi, Sapna/HGA-5265-2022",,Science Foundation Ireland [SFI/12/RC/2289],Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland),This work has been supported by Science Foundation Ireland under grant number SFI/12/RC/2289,,19,6,6,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS-ACL,STROUDSBURG,"209 N EIGHTH STREET, STROUDSBURG, PA 18360 USA",,,978-1-948087-44-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,49,54,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Linguistics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Linguistics,BP0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000538331700007,0

Such a matching market can be viewed as a variation of Fisher market, albeit with rather peculiar preferences of agents. These preferences can be described by piece-wise linear concave (PLC) functions, which however, are not separable (due to each agent only asking for one item), are not monotone, and do not satisfy the gross substitute property-increase in price of an item can result in increased demand for the item. Devanur and Kannan in FOCS 08 showed that market clearing prices can be found in polynomial time in markets with fixed number of items and general PLC preferences. They also consider Fischer markets with fixed number of agents (instead of fixed number of items), and give a polynomial time algorithm for this case if preferences are separable functions of the items, in addition to being PLC functions. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm for finding market clearing prices in matching markets with fixed number of different agent preferences, despite that the utility corresponding to matching markets is not separable. We also give a simpler algorithm for the case of matching markets with fixed number of different items.","[Alaei, Saeed] Google Inc, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Khalilabadi, Pooya Jalaly; Tardos, Eva] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Google Incorporated; Cornell University,"Alaei, S (通讯作者)，Google Inc, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",,,,NSF [CCF-1563714]; ONR [N00014-08-1-0031]; Google Research Grant; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1563714] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We want to thank the generous support of NSF via grant CCF-1563714, ONR via grant N00014-08-1-0031, and a Google Research Grant.",,14,4,6,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,245,260,,10.1145/3033274.3085150,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900027,0

Selfish clients submit jobs, each with an arrival time, deadline, length, and value. The service provider's goal is to implement a truthful online mechanism for scheduling jobs so as to maximize the social welfare of the schedule. Recent work shows that under a stochastic assumption on job arrivals, there is a single-parameter family of mechanisms that achieves near-optimal social welfare. We show that given any such family of near-optimal online mechanisms, there exists an online mechanism that in the worst case performs nearly as well as the best of the given mechanisms. Our mechanism is truthful whenever the mechanisms in the given family are truthful and prompt, and achieves optimal (within constant factors) regret. We model the problem of competing against a family of online scheduling mechanisms as one of learning from expert advice. A primary challenge is that any scheduling decisions we make affect not only the payoff at the current step, but also the resource availability and payooffs in future steps. Furthermore, switching from one algorithm (a.k.a. expert) to another in an online fashion is challenging both because it requires synchronization with the state of the latter algorithm as well as because it affects the incentive structure of the algorithms. We further show how to adapt our algorithm to a non-clairvoyant setting where job lengths are unknown until jobs are run to completion.

Previous work on selfish scheduling protocols has focused on two extreme models: omnipotent protocols that are aware of every machine and every job that is active at any given time, and oblivious protocols that are aware of nothing beyond the machine they control. The main focus of this paper is on a well-motivated middle-ground model of resource-aware protocols, which are aware of the set of machines that the system comprises, but unaware of what jobs are active at any given time. Apart from considering budget-balanced protocols, to which previous work was restricted, we augment the design space by also studying the extent to which overcharging can lead to improved performance. We first show that, in the omnipotent model, overcharging enables us to enforce the optimal outcome as the unique equilibrium, which largely improves over the Theta(log n)-approximation of social welfare that can be obtained by budget-balanced protocols, even in their best equilibrium [32]. We then transition to the resource-aware model and provide price of anarchy (PoA) upper and lower bounds for different classes of cost functions. For concave cost functions, we provide a protocol with PoA of 1 + epsilon for arbitrarily small epsilon > 0. When the cost functions can be both convex and concave we construct an overcharging protocol that yields PoA <= 2; a spectacular improvement over the bounds obtained for budget-balanced protocols, even in the omnipotent model. We complement our positive results with impossibility results for general increasing cost functions. We show that any resource-aware budget-balanced cost-sharing protocol has PoA of Theta(n) in this setting and, even if we use overcharging, no resource-aware protocol can achieve a PoA of o(root n).","[Christodoulou, Giorgos; Sgouritsa, Alkmini] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Gkatzelis, Vasilis] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Liverpool; Drexel University,"Christodoulou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",,,"Gkatzelis, Vasilis/0000-0001-7203-438X","EPSRC [EP/M008118/1]; Royal Society [LT140046]; National Science Foundation [CCF-1216073, CCF-1161813, CCF-1408635]; EPSRC [EP/M008118/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The first author was supported by EPSRC EP/M008118/1 and Royal Society LT140046.

The established solution to this problem is a class of peer prediction mechanisms, where each agent is rewarded based on how his answers compare with those of his peer agents. These peer prediction mechanisms are designed by exploring the stochastic correlation of agents' answers. The prior distribution of agents' true answers is often assumed to be known to the principal or at least to the agents. In this paper, we consider the problem of IEWV for heterogeneous binary signal tasks, where the answer distributions for different tasks are different and unknown a priori. A concrete setting is eliciting labels for training data. Here, data points are represented by their feature vectors x's and the principal wants to obtain corresponding binary labels y's from strategic agents. We design peer prediction mechanisms that leverage not only the stochastic correlation of agents' labels for the same feature vector x but also the (learned) correlation between feature vectors x's and the ground-truth labels y's. In our mechanism, each agent is rewarded by how his answer compares with a reference answer generated by a classiffication algorithm specialized for dealing with noisy data. Every agent truthfully reporting and exerting high effort form a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. Some benefits of this approach include: (1) we do not need to always re-assign each task to multiple workers to obtain redundant answers. (2) A class of surrogate loss functions for binary classification can help us design new reward functions for peer prediction. (3) Symmetric uninformative reporting strategy (pure or mixed) is not an equilibrium strategy. (4) The principal does not need to know the joint distribution of workers' information a priori. We hope this work can point to a new and promising direction of information elicitation via more intelligent algorithms.","[Liu, Yang; Chen, Yiling] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",yangl@seas.harvard.edu; yiling@seas.harvard.edu,"Chen, Yuxuan/IWL-8267-2023; Chen, Yi/HIR-2608-2022; chen, ye Xiao/HSF-9650-2023; Chen, Yi/HPD-0595-2023; Chen, Yi/JBR-7728-2023; wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023; Chen, yf/JMR-4435-2023",,National Science Foundation [CCF-1301976]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1301976] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under grant CCF-1301976.,,29,16,22,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,63,80,,10.1145/3033274.3085126,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900008,0

Our objective is the classic makespan minimization objective, which corresponds to the completion time of the last job to complete. The incentives of the selfish jobs may lead to poor performance. To reconcile the differing objectives, we introduce posted machine prices. The selfish job seeks to minimize the sum of its completion time on the machine and the posted price for the machine. Prices may be static (i.e., set once and for all before any arrival) or dynamic (i.e., change over time), but they are determined only by the past, assuming nothing about upcoming events. Obviously, such schemes are inherently truthful. We consider the competitive ratio: the ratio between the makespan achievable by the pricing scheme and that of the optimal algorithm. We give tight bounds on the competitive ratio for both dynamic and static pricing schemes for identical, restricted, related, and unrelated machine settings. Our main result is a dynamic pricing scheme for related machines that gives a constant competitive ratio, essentially matching the competitive ratio of online algorithms for this setting. In contrast, dynamic pricing gives poor performance for unrelated machines. This lower bound also exhibits a gap between what can be achieved by pricing versus what can be achieved by online algorithms.","[Feldman, Michal; Fiat, Amos] Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Roytman, Alan] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",Tel Aviv University; University of Copenhagen,"Feldman, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Blavatnik Sch Comp Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.",mfeldman@tau.ac.il; fiat@tau.ac.il; alanr@di.ku.dk,,,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant [337122]; Thorup's Advanced Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-0602-02499B]; Israel Science Foundation [822/10]; Israeli Centers for Research Excellence (ICORE) program,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Thorup's Advanced Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Israeli Centers for Research Excellence (ICORE) program,"The work of M.

We show that the Maximum Nash Welfare solution, which is known to satisfy appealing fairness properties in the classic setting, satisfies or approximates all three relaxations in our framework.

To evaluate an online matching mechanism, we use the notion of blocking pairs from stable matching theory: our goal is to maximize the number of positions (or secretaries) that do not take part in a blocking pair. This is compared with a stable matching in which no blocking pair exists. We consider the case where secretaries arrive randomly, as well as that of an adversarial arrival order, and provide corresponding upper and lower bounds.","[Babichenko, Yakov; Emek, Yuval; Smorodinsky, Rann] Technion, Haifa, Israel; [Feldman, Michal; Patt-Shamir, Boaz] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Peretz, Ron] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Tel Aviv University; Bar Ilan University,"Babichenko, Y (通讯作者)，Technion, Haifa, Israel.",yakovbab@tx.technion.ac.il; yemek@technion.ac.il; mfeldman@tau.ac.il; boaz@tau.ac.il; ron.peretz@biu.ac.il; rann@ie.technion.ac.il,,,Israeli Science Foundation [2021296]; European Research Council under the European Union [337122]; Israel Science Foundation [1444/14]; Technion VPR grants; Bernard M.

We model such settings in both classical and contextual bandit models in which the myopic agents maximize rewards according to current empirical averages, but are also amenable to exogenous payments that may cause them to alter their choices. Our notion of fairness asks that more qualified individuals are never (probabilistically) preferred over less qualified ones [8]. We investigate whether it is possible to design inexpensive subsidy or payment schemes for a principal to motivate myopic agents to play fairly in all or almost all rounds. When the principal has full information about the state of the myopic agents, we show it is possible to induce fair play on every round with a subsidy scheme of total cost o(T) (for the classic setting with k arms, (O) over tilde(root k(3)T), and for the d-dimensional linear contextual seSing (O) over tilde (d root k(3)T)). If the principal has much more limited information (as might often be the case for an external regulator or watchdog), and only observes the number of rounds in which members from each of the k groups were selected, but not the empirical estimates maintained by the myopic agent, the design of such a scheme becomes more complex. We show both positive and negative results in the classic and linear bandit settings by upper and lower bounding the cost of fair subsidy schemes.","[Kannan, Sampath; Kearns, Michael; Morgenstern, Jamie; Roth, Aaron; Vohra, Rakesh; Wu, Zhiwei Steven] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pai, Mallesh] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Rice University,"Kannan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,"Roth, Aaron/0000-0002-0586-0515","National Science Foundation [CNS-0435060, CCR-0325197, EN-CS-0329609]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation, under grant CNS-0435060, grant CCR-0325197 and grant EN-CS-0329609.

Is dominant-strategy implementation equivalent to the semantically less stringent Bayesian one (as in the case of Myerson's 1-item auction)? Can one find explicit solutions for non-trivial families of multi-item auctions (as in the 1-item case)? In this paper, we present such natural families whose explicit solutions exhibit a revenue gap between the two implementations. More precisely, consider the k-item n-buyer maximum revenue auction where k, n > 1 with additive valuation in the independent setting (i.e., the buyers i have independent private distributions F-ij on items j). We derive exact formulas for the maximum revenue when k = 2 and F-ij are any IID distributions on support of size 2, for both the dominant-strategy (DIC) and the Bayesian (BIC) implementations. The formulas lead to the simple characterization that, the two models have identical maximum revenue if and only if selling-separately is optimal for the distribution. Our results also give the first demonstration, in this setting, of revenue gaps between the two models. For instance, if k = n = 2 and Pr(X-F = 1} = Pr{X-F = 2} = 1/2, then the maximum revenue in the Bayesian implementation exceeds that in the dominant-strategy by exactly 2%; the same gap exists for the continuous uniform distribution X-F over [a, a + 1 ] boolean OR [2a, 2a + 1] for all large a.","[Yao, Andrew Chi-Chih] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Yao, ACC (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",andrewcyao@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,29,15,21,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,3,20,,10.1145/3033274.3085120,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900002,0

Our characterization reveals an interesting structure underlying all truthful mechanisms, showing that they can be decomposed into two components: a selection part where players pick their best subset among prespecified choices determined by the mechanism, and an exchange part where players are offered the chance to exchange certain subsets if it is favorable to do so. In the remaining paper, we apply our main result and derive several consequences on the design of mechanisms with fairness guarantees. We consider various notions of fairness, (indicatively, maximin share guarantees and envy-freeness up to one item) and provide tight bounds for their approximability.

The same paper also proposed the second-best mechanism that maximizes the GFT subject to BIC, IR, and BB constraints, which is unfortunately rather complex for even the single-seller single-buyer case. Our mechanism is simple, BIC, IR, and BB and achieves 1=2 of the optimal GFT among all BIC, IR, and BB mechanisms.

The markets we consider consist of buyers and sellers of a number of items, and the aim of a mechanism is to improve the social welfare by arranging purchases and sales of the items. A mechanism is given prior distributions on the agents' valuations of the items, but not the actual valuations; thus the aim is to maximise the expected social welfare over these distributions. As in previous work, we are interested in the worst-case ratio between the social welfare achieved by a truthful mechanism, and the best social welfare possible. Our main result is an incentive compatible and budget balanced constant-factor approximation mechanism in a setting where buyers have XOS valuations and sellers' valuations are additive. The is the first such approximation mechanism for a two-sided market setting where the agents have combinatorial valuation functions. To achieve this result, we introduce a more general kind of demand query that seems to be needed in this situation. In the simpler case that sellers have unit supply (each having just one item to sell), we give a new mechanism whose welfare guarantee improves on a recent one in the literature. We also introduce a more demanding version of the strong budget balance (SBB) criterion, aimed at ruling out certain unnatural transactions satisfied by SBB. We show that the stronger version is satisfied by our mechanisms.","[Colini-Baldeschi, Riccardo] LUISS, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Rome, Italy; [Goldberg, Paul W.; Turchetta, Stefano] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [de Keijzer, Bart] Ctr Wiskunde & Informat CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Leonardi, Stefano] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; [Roughgarden, Tim] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Turchetta, Stefano] KPMG Italy, Milan, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Oxford; Sapienza University Rome; Stanford University,"Colini-Baldeschi, R (通讯作者)，LUISS, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Rome, Italy.",,"Goldberg, Paul/ADX-8145-2022","Goldberg, Paul/0000-0002-5436-7890",NSF [CCF-1524062]; Google Focused Award on Algorithms for Large-scale Data Analysis; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1524062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Google Focused Award on Algorithms for Large-scale Data Analysis(Google Incorporated); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),The authors thank anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

A cloud computing platform such as Amazon EC2 sells virtual machines to clients, each of who needs a different number of virtual machine hours. Similarly, cloud storage providers such as Dropbox have customers that require different amounts of storage. Software companies such as Microsoft sell software subscriptions that can have different levels of service. The levels could be the number of different documents you are allowed to create, or the number of hours you are allowed to use the software. Companies like Google and Microsoft sell API calls to artificial intelligence software such as face recognition, to other software developers. Video and mobile games are increasingly designed in such a way that one can pay for better access to certain features. Spotify and iTunes sell music subscription, and different people listen to different number of songs in a month. Cellphone service providers like AT&T and Verizon offer cellular phone call minutes and data. People have widely varying amounts of data consumption. Pricing is an important component in all these examples. The aim of this paper is to understand how to price such goods, for a monopolist seller who aims to maximize her revenue. The following common features (to a first degree of approximation) of these examples are crucial for our model. The marginal cost of offering a higher level of service is essentially a constant. The valuations for the different levels of service are roughly linear, subject to a cap. Based on this, we consider the following problem. There is a single good with multiple units of it for sale. Equivalently, there is a single service with various levels of service. The marginal cost to the seller for procuring another unit of the good is a constant. There is a population of buyers, each of who has a linear valuation for consuming a number of units of the good, subject to a cap (which we refer to as demand). The type/private information of a buyer is determined by the per-unit valuation and the demand. Buyers try to maximize their utility which is quasi linear, i.e., the valuation minus their payment. The question is what is the revenue maximizing pricing scheme.","[Devanur, Nikhil R.] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Haghpanah, Nima] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Psomas, Alexandros] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",Microsoft; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Devanur, NR (通讯作者)，Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",,,,"NSF [CCF1408635, CCF0964033]; Templeton Foundation [3966]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Templeton Foundation,"This work is supported by the NSF, under grants CCF1408635, CCF0964033, Templeton Foundation grant 3966.",,6,2,4,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,41,42,,10.1145/3033274.3085122,0.0,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900005,0

A rich and growing line of work in the behavioral sciences indicate that human choices follow not only from the utility of alternatives, but also from the choice set in which alternatives are presented. In this work we study comparison-based choice functions, a simple but surprisingly rich class of functions capable of exhibiting so-called choice-set effects. Motivated by the challenge of predicting complex choices, we study the query complexity of these functions in a variety of settings. We consider settings that allow for active queries or passive observation of a stream of queries, and give analyses both at the granularity of individuals or populations that might exhibit heterogeneous choice behavior. Our main result is that any comparison-based choice function in one dimension can be inferred as efficiently as a basic maximum or minimum choice function across many query contexts, suggesting that choice-set effects need not entail any fundamental algorithmic barriers to inference. We also introduce a class of choice functions we call distance-comparison based functions, and briefly discuss the analysis of such functions. The framework we outline provides intriguing connections between human choice behavior and a range of questions in the theory of sorting.","[Kleinberg, Jon] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Mullainathan, Sendhil] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ugander, Johan] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Cornell University; Harvard University; Stanford University,"Kleinberg, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kleinber@cs.cornell.edu; mullain@fas.harvard.edu; jugander@stanford.edu,,"Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052",Simons Investigator Award; ARO MURI grant; Google Research Grant; Facebook Faculty Research Grants; David Morgenthaler II Faculty Fellowship,Simons Investigator Award; ARO MURI grant(MURI); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated); Facebook Faculty Research Grants(Facebook Inc); David Morgenthaler II Faculty Fellowship,"This work is supported in part by a Simons Investigator Award, an ARO MURI grant, a Google Research Grant, Facebook Faculty Research Grants, and a David Morgenthaler II Faculty Fellowship.",,33,10,13,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,127,144,,10.1145/3033274.3085134,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900016,0

The goods are not in limited supply, but can only be produced at a limited rate and are costly to produce. The seller observes only the bundle of goods purchased at each day, but nothing else about the buyers valuation function. Our main result is a dynamic pricing algorithm for optimizing welfare (including the seller's cost of production) that runs in time and a number of rounds that are polynomial in d and the approximation parameter. We are able to do this despite the fact that (i) the price-response function is not continuous, and even its fractional relaxation is a non-concave function of the prices, and (ii) the welfare is not observable to the seller. We derive this result as an application of a general technique for optimizing welfare over divisible goods, which is of independent interest. When buyers have strongly concave, Holder continuous valuation functions over d divisible goods, we give a general polynomial time dynamic pricing technique. We are able to apply this technique to the setting of unit-demand buyers despite the fact that in that setting the goods are not divisible, and the natural fractional relaxation of a unit-demand valuation is not strongly concave. To apply our general technique, we introduce a novel price randomization procedure that has the effect of implicitly inducing buyers to regularize their valuations with a strongly concave function. Finally, we also extend our results to a limited-supply setting in which the number of each good cannot be replenished.","[Roth, Aaron; Wu, Zhiwei Steven] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Slivkins, Aleksandrs] Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; [Ullman, Jonathan] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Microsoft; Northeastern University,"Roth, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,"Wu, Steven/0000-0002-8125-8227; Roth, Aaron/0000-0002-0586-0515",NSF [CNS-1253345]; Sloan Foundation Fellowship; DARPA grant,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sloan Foundation Fellowship(Alfred P.

By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that only a logarithmic dependence on the branching factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of Omega (b(d) d), where b is the branching factor of the player, and d is the depth of the game tree. Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in practice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their theoretically inferior convergence rates.

In this approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all agents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal preferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them. Distortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the sum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and that of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The worst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how close it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the underlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs, the well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3 (Anshelevich et al. 2015). We disprove this conjecture by constructing a sequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked Pairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst-case distortion of Ranked Pairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving that in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked Pairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament rules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected worst-case distortion of less than 3. Using the concept of approximate majorization within the distortion framework, we prove that Copeland and Randomized Dictatorship achieve low constant factor fairness-ratios (5 and 3 respectively), which is a considerable generalization of similar results for the sum of costs and single largest cost objectives. In addition to all of the above, we outline several interesting directions for further research in this space.","[Goel, Ashish; Krishnaswamy, Anilesh K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Munagala, Kamesh] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Stanford University; Duke University,"Goel, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",anilesh@stanford.edu; ashishg@stanford.edu; kamesh@cs.duke.edu,,,"NSF [CCF-1637418, CCF-1408784, CCF-1637397, IIS-1447554]; ONR [N00014-15-1-2786]; ARO [W911NF-14-1-0526]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); ARO,"Anilesh K.

When n agents are present, there is only one truly fair allocation: each agent receives 1/n of the resource. Implementing this static solution in the dynamic world is notoriously impractical; there are too many disruptions to existing allocations: for a new agent to get her fair share, all other agents must give up a small piece. A natural remedy is simply to restrict the number of allowed disruptions when a new agent arrives. [16] considered this setting, and introduced a natural benchmark - the fairness ratio - the ratio of the minimal share to the ideal share (1/k when there are k agents in the system). They described an algorithm that obtains the optimal fairness ratio when d >= 1 disruptions are allowed per arriving agent. However, in systems with high arrival rates even one disruption per arrival can be too costly. We consider the scenario when fewer than one disruption per arrival is allowed. We show that we can maintain high levels of fairness even with significantly fewer than one disruption per arrival. In particular, we present an instance-optimal algorithm (the input to the algorithm is a vector of allowed disruptions) and show that the fairness ratio of this algorithm decays logarithmically with c, where c is the longest number of consecutive time steps in which we are not allowed any disruptions. We then consider dynamic fair division with multiple, heterogeneous resources. In this model, agents demand the resources in fixed proportions, known in economics as Leontief preferences. We show that the general problem is NP-hard, even if the resource demands are binary and known in advance.

A publicly known cost function specifices the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are (economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging (i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting, combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task. We present the Potential Mechanism - a combination of the VCG mechanism and a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations, symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with general valuations.","[Dobzinski, Shahar; Ovadia, Shahar] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel",Weizmann Institute of Science,"Dobzinski, S (通讯作者)，Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel.",shahar.dobzinski@weizmann.ac.il; shaharov59@gmail.com,,,I-CORE program of the planning and budgeting commiSee; Israel Science Foundation [4/11]; EU CIG grant [618128],I-CORE program of the planning and budgeting commiSee; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); EU CIG grant,The first author is the incumbent of the Lilian and George LySle Career Development Chair.

This result implies a polynomial (in the input) algorithm for a weak approximate equilibrium. For approximate Nash equilibrium we introduce a closely related question and prove its equivalence to the well-known Beck-Fiala conjecture from discrepancy theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that introduces a connection between game theory and discrepancy theory. For a correlated equilibrium, we prove a O(1/log n) lower-bound on the grid size, which matches the known upper bound of Omega(1/log n). Our result implies an Omega(log n) lower bound on the rate of convergence of any dynamic to approximate correlated (and coarse correlated) equilibrium.

In real-world markets with many agents, this communication requirement is implausibly high. This casts doubts on whether stable matching can arise in large markets. We study markets with realistic structure on the preferences and information of agents, and show that in typical markets, a stable matching can be found with much less communication effort. In our model, the preferences of workers are unrestricted, and the preferences of firms follow an additively separable latent utility model. Our efficient communication protocol modifies workers-proposing DA, by having firms signal workers they especially like, while also broadcasting qualification requirements to discourage other workers who have no realistic chances from applying. In the special case of tiered random markets, the protocol can be modified to run in two-rounds and involve only private messages.

Unlike prior work on this model, we allow many states of nature. We assume that the principal's objective is a monotone set function, and study the problem both in the public signal and private signal models, drawing a sharp contrast between the two in terms of both efficacy and computational complexity. When private signals are allowed, our results are largely positive and quite general. First, we use linear programming duality and the equivalence of separation and optimization to show polynomial-time equivalence between (exactly) optimal signaling and the problem of maximizing the objective function plus an additive function. This yields an efficient implementation of the optimal scheme when the objective is supermodular or anonymous. Second, we exhibit a (1 - 1/e)-approximation of the optimal private signaling scheme, modulo an additive loss of epsilon, when the objective function is submodular. These two results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [3, 4], extending them from a binary state of nature to many states (modulo the additive loss in the later result). Third, we consider the binary-state case with a submodular objective, and simplify and slightly strengthen the result of [4] to obtain a (1 - 1/e)-approximation via a scheme which (i) signals independently to each receiver and (ii) is oblivious in that it does not depend on the objective function so long as it is monotone submodular. When only a public signal is allowed, our results are negative. First, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within any constant factor, even when the objective is additive. Second, we show that the optimal private scheme can outperform the optimal public scheme, in terms of maximizing the sender's objective, by a polynomial factor.","[Dughmi, Shaddin; Xu, Haifeng] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Dughmi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",shaddin@usc.edu; haifengx@usc.edu,,,NSF [CCF-1350900],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by NSF grant CCF-1350900.,,27,16,19,1,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,351,368,,10.1145/3033274.3085152,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900040,0

As such, well-designed centralized markets must induce participants to join voluntarily, in spite of pre-existing decentralized institutions they may already be using. Utilizing the general framework of Monderer and Tennenholtz (2009)[1], we take the view that centralizing a market is akin to designing a mediator to which people may sign away their decision rights. The mediator is voluntary in the sense that it cannot condition the actions of those who participate on the actions of those who do not. Within this setting we propose a new desideratum for market design: Dominant Individual Rationality (D-IR). A mediator is D-IR if every decentralized strategy is weakly dominated by some centralized strategy. While such a criterion does not offer a prediction about how people will behave within the centralized market, it does provide a strong guarantee that all players will use centralized strategies rather than opting out of the centralized market. We show that suitable modification of the Boston mechanism satisfies D-IR and a similar modification of any stable matching mechanism satisfies an approximation of D-IR. In both cases the modification relies on allowing the receiving end of the market to accept offers in either the centralized or decentralized part of the market. This design closely resembles the suggestion of Niederle et al. (2006) [2] about centralizing the market for gastroenterologists. Relative to their analysis, ours highlights why this design feature coupled with some, but not all, matching algorithms is effective in inducing participation of the proposing side of the market. Further, by highlighting its role in attaining (approximate) D-IR our analysis provides a new non-cooperative justification for stability. In other applications we demonstrate that, suitably modified, Top Trading Cycles satisfies D-IR, and double auctions satisfy approximate D-IR.

We formulate two somewhat general techniques for designing good pricing algorithms for this setting: Price Doubling and Item Halving. Using these techniques, we unify many of the existing results in the item pricing literature under a common framework, as well as provide several new bicriteria algorithms for approximating both revenue and social welfare simultaneously. More specifically, for a variety of settings with item pricing, we show that it is possible to deterministically obtain a log-approximation for revenue and a constant-approximation for social welfare simultaneously: thus one need not sacrifice revenue if the goal is to still have decent welfare guarantees. The main technical contribution of this paper is a O((log m + log k)(2))-approximation algorithm for revenue maximization based on the item halving technique, for settings where buyers have XoS valuations, where m is the number of goods and k is the average supply. Surprisingly, ours is the first known item pricing algorithm with polylogarithmic approximation for such general classes of valuations, and partially resolves an important open question from the algorithmic pricing literature about the existence of item pricing algorithms with logarithmic factors for general valuations [4]. We also use the item halving framework to form envy-free item pricing mechanisms for the popular setting of multi-unit markets, providing a log-approximation to revenue in this case.","[Anshelevich, Elliot; Sekar, Shreyas] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Comp Sci, 110,8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Anshelevich, E (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Comp Sci, 110,8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",eanshel@cs.rpi.edu; shreyas.sekar@gmail.com,,,"NSF [CNS-1218374, CCF-1527497]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was partially supported by NSF awards CNS-1218374 and CCF-1527497.,,27,3,3,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,325,342,,10.1145/3033274.3085117,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900035,0

Wagering mechanisms can be used to elicit predictions from agents who reveal their beliefs by placing bets. Lambert et al. [20, 21] introduced weighted score wagering mechanisms, a class of budget-balanced wagering mechanisms under which agents with immutable beliefs truthfully report their predictions. However, we demonstrate that these and other existing incentive compatible wagering mechanisms are not Pareto optimal: agents have significant budget left over even when additional trade would be mutually benficial. Motivated by this observation, we design a new wagering mechanism, the double clinching auction, a two-sided version of the adaptive clinching auction [9]. We show that no wagering mechanism can simultaneously satisfy weak budget balance, individual rationality, weak incentive compatibility, and Pareto optimality. However, we prove that the double clinching auction attains the first three and show in a series of simulations using real contest data that it comes much closer to Pareto optimality than previously known incentive compatible wagering mechanisms, in some cases almost matching the efficiency of the Pareto optimal (but not incentive compatible) parimutuel consensus mechanism. When the goal of wagering is to crowdsource probabilities, Pareto optimality drives participation and incentive compatibility drives accuracy, making the double clinching auction an attractive and practical choice. Our mechanism may be of independent interest as the first two-sided version of the adaptive clinching auction.","[Freeman, Rupert] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Pennock, David M.; Vaughan, Jennifer Wortman] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA",Duke University; Microsoft,"Freeman, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,"Freeman, Rupert/0000-0003-4744-9449; Pennock, David/0000-0003-0522-4815",,,,,25,9,12,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,43,60,,10.1145/3033274.3085118,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900006,0

These approaches have generally considered an agent who experiences a single behavioral bias, studying the effect of this bias on the outcome. In general, however, decision-making can and will be affected by multiple biases operating at the same time. How do multiple biases interact to produce the overall outcome? Here we consider decisions in the presence of a pair of biases exhibiting an intuitively natural interaction: present bias - the tendency to value costs incurred in the present too highly - and sunk-cost bias - the tendency to incorporate costs experienced in the past into one's plans for the future. We propose a theoretical model for planning with this pair of biases, and we show how certain natural behavioral phenomena can arise in our model only when agents exhibit both biases. As part of our model we differentiate between agents that are aware of their biases (sophisticated) and agents that are unaware of them (naive). Interestingly, we show that the interaction between the two biases is quite complex: in some cases, they mitigate each other's effects while in other cases they might amplify each other. We obtain a number of further results as well, including the fact that the planning problem in our model for an agent experiencing and aware of both biases is computationally hard in general, though tractable under more relaxed assumptions.","[Kleinberg, Jon; Raghavan, Manish] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Oren, Sigal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Cornell University; Ben Gurion University,"Kleinberg, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Oren, Sigal/AHE-1701-2022","Oren, Sigal/0000-0002-4271-7291",Simons Investigator Award; ARO MURI grant; Google Research Grant; Facebook Faculty Research Grant,Simons Investigator Award; ARO MURI grant(MURI); Google Research Grant(Google Incorporated); Facebook Faculty Research Grant(Facebook Inc),"Supported in part by a Simons Investigator Award, an ARO MURI grant, a Google Research Grant, and a Facebook Faculty Research Grant.",,25,8,9,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,567,584,,10.1145/3033274.3085156,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900060,0

We study a practically important class of security games that is played out in space and time, with targets and patrols moving on a real line. A central open question here is whether the Nash equilibrium (i.e., the minimax strategy of the defender) can be computed in polynomial time. We resolve this question in the affirmative. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in the input size, and only polylogarithmic in the number of possible patrol locations (M). Further, we provide a continuous extension in which patrol locations can take arbitrary real values. Prior work obtained polynomial-time algorithms only under a substantial assumption, e.g., a constant number of rounds.

In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space, and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so, then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the metric space? We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice setting: a population of voters, two candidates, and a majority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one; this holds even when the underlying metric is a line. We examine how this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio improves from 3 to (4 - 2 root 2) approximate to 1.1716; this bound is tight. When the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of 1.5 and a constant upper bound strictly better than 2 on the distortion of majority rule. The aforementioned positive results depend in part on the assumption that the two candidates are independently and identically distributed. However, we show that i.i.d. candidates do not suffice for our upper bounds: if the population of candidates can be different from that of voters, an upper bound of 2 on the distortion is tight for both general metric spaces and the line. Thus, we show a constant gap between representative and non-representative candidates in both cases.","[Cheng, Yu; Dughmi, Shaddin; Kempe, David] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Cheng, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,,"Cheng, Yu/0000-0002-0019-2570","Shang-Hua Teng's Simons Investigator Award; NSF [CCF-1423618, IIS-1619458]; NSF CAREER award [CCF-1350900]",Shang-Hua Teng's Simons Investigator Award; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF CAREER award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"Yu Cheng is supported in part by Shang-Hua Teng's Simons Investigator Award.

We compare the expected revenue of these mechanisms to the expected revenue of the optimal auction in two different settings. Namely, the nonadaptive setting in which all offers are sent to the customers beforehand, and the adaptive setting in which an offer is made when a consumer arrives. For the nonadaptive case, we obtain a strategy achieving an expected revenue within at least a 1 - 1/e fraction of that of the optimal auction. We also show that this bound is tight, even if the customers have i.i.d. valuations for the item.

Given these polytopes, a strategy profile naturally corresponds to an integral vector in the aggregation polytope P-N = Sigma(i) P-i. We identify two general properties of the aggregation polytope P-N that are sufficient for our results to go through, namely the integer decomposition property (IDP) and the box-totally dual integrality property (box-TDI). Intuitively, the IDP is needed to decompose a load profile in P-N into a respective strategy profile of the players, and box-TDI ensures that the intersection of a polytope with an arbitrary integer box is an integral polytope. Examples of polytopal congestion games which satisfy IDP and box-TDI include common source network congestion games, symmetric totally unimodular congestion games, non-symmetric matroid congestion games and symmetric matroid intersection congestion games (in particular, r-arborescences and strongly base-orderable matroids). Our main contributions for polytopal congestion games satisfying IDP and box-TDI are as follows: (1) We derive tight bounds on the price of stability for these games. This extends a result of Fotakis (2010) on the price of stability for symmetric network congestion games to the larger class of polytopal congestion games. Our bounds improve upon the ones for general polynomial congestion games obtained by Christodoulou and Gairing (2016). (2) We show that pure Nash equilibria can be computed in strongly polynomial time for these games. To this aim, we generalize a recent aggregation/decomposition framework by Del Pia et al. (2017) for symmetric totally unimodular and non-symmetric matroid congestion games, both being a special case of our polytopal congestion games. (3) Finally, we generalize and extend results on the computation of strong equilibria in bottleneck congestion games studied by Harks, Hoefer, Klimm and Skopalik (2013). In particular, we show that strong equilibria can be computed efficiently for symmetric totally unimodular boSleneck congestion games. In general, our results reveal that the combination of IDP and box-TDI gives rise to an efficient approach to compute a pure Nash equilibrium whose inefficiency is better than in general congestion games.","[Kleer, Pieter; Schafer, Guido] CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schafer, Guido] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kleer, P (通讯作者)，CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,223,240,,10.1145/3033274.3085149,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900024,0

Our replication confirms that this is the case, following the original study's assumption that the financial firms' behaviors are fixed. We then extend the model to account for a possible strategic response, where financial firms adapt to the regulatory regime. Using empirical game-theoretic analysis, we derive equilibria with and without regulation. We find that in the new Basel-regulated equilibria, more funds stay out of default and banks lose less capital.

Our fairness guarantees are in terms of the maximin share, that is defined to be the maximum value that an agent can ensure for herself, if she were to partition the goods into n bundles, and then receive a minimum valued bundle. Since maximin fair allocations (i.e., allocations in which each agent gets at least her maximin share) do not always exist, prior work has focussed on approximation results that aim to find allocations in which the value of the bundle allocated to each agent is (multiplicatively) as close to her maximin share as possible. In particular, Procaccia and Wang (2014) along with Amanatidis et al. (2015) have shown that under additive valuations a 2 /3-approximate maximin fair allocation always exists and can be found in polynomial time. We complement these results by developing a simple and efficient algorithm that achieves the same approximation guarantee. Furthermore, we initiate the study of approximate maximin fair division under submodular valuations. Specifically, we show that when the valuations of the agents are nonnegative, monotone, and submodular, then a 1\10-approximate maximin fair allocation is guaranteed to exist. In fact, we show that such an allocation can be efficiently found by using a simple round-robin algorithm. A technical contribution of the paper is to analyze the performance of this combinatorial algorithm by employing the concept of multilinear extensions.","[Barman, Siddharth] Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Murthy, Sanath Kumar Krishna] Chennai Math Inst, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Chennai Mathematical Institute,"Barman, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",,,,Ramanujan Fellowship [SERB -SB/S2/RJN-128/2015],Ramanujan Fellowship(Department of Science & Technology (India)),The first author was supported in part by a Ramanujan Fellowship (SERB -SB/S2/RJN-128/2015).,,37,54,66,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,647,664,,10.1145/3033274.3085136,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900068,0

In our setting, under standard continuity and convexity conditions, a stable outcome exists in any acyclic network, as long as all firms regard sales as substitutes and the market is large. Thus, complementarities between inputs do not preclude the existence of stable outcomes in large markets, unlike in discrete markets. Even when sales are not substitutable, tree stable outcomes exist in our setting. The model presented in this paper generalizes and unifies versions of general equilibrium models with divisible and indivisible goods, matching models with continuously divisible contracts, models of large (two-sided) matching with complementarities, and club formation models. Additional results provide intuition for the role of uni-directional substitutability conditions and acyclicity in the main existence results, and explain what kinds of equilibria are guaranteed to exist even when these conditions are relaxed.

This is limiting in many domains, where we would expect agents to differ in taste, judgment and reliability. Although the Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism [30] can be extended to handle heterogeneous agents, the new challenge is with the efficient estimation of agent signal types. We solve this problem by clustering agents based on their reporting behavior, proposing a mechanism that works with clusters of agents and designing algorithms that learn such a clustering. In this way, we also connect peer prediction with the Dawid and Skene [5] literature on latent types. We retain the robustness against coordinated misreports of the CA mechanism, achieving an approximate incentive guarantee of epsilon-informed truthfulness.

The algorithms in this setting are considered non-adaptive as they have to choose the subgraph H without knowing any information about the set of realized edges in G. Originally motivated by an application to kidney exchange, the stochastic matching problem and its variants have received significant attention in recent years. The state-of-the-art non-adaptive algorithms for stochastic matching achieve an approximation ratio of 1/2 - epsilon for any epsilon > 0, naturally raising the question that if 1/2 is the limit of what can be achieved with a non-adaptive algorithm. In this work, we resolve this question by presenting the first algorithm for stochastic matching with an approximation guarantee that is strictly better than 1/2: the algorithm computes a subgraph H of G with the maximum degree O(log (1/p)/p) such that the ratio of expected size of a maximum matching in realizations of H and G is at least 1/2 + delta(0) for some absolute constant delta(0) > 0. The degree bound on H achieved by our algorithm is essentially the best possible (up to an O(log (1/p)) factor) for any constant factor approximation algorithm, since an Omega(1/p) degree in H is necessary for a vertex to acquire at least one incident edge in a realization. Our result makes progress towards answering an open problem of Blum et al. (EC 2015) regarding the possibility of achieving a (1 - epsilon)-approximation for the stochastic matching problem using non-adaptive algorithms. From the technical point of view, a key ingredient of our algorithm is a structural result showing that a graph whose expected maximum matching size is opt always contains a b-matching of size (essentially) b .

This problem was originally introduced by Dobzinski, Nisan, and Oren (STOC'14) as the following simple market scenario: m items are to be allocated among n bidders in a distributed setting where bidders valuations are private and hence communication is needed to obtain an efficient allocation. The communication happens in rounds: in each round, each bidder, simultaneously with others, broadcasts a message to all parties involved. At the end, the central planner computes an allocation solely based on the communicated messages. Dobzinski et al. showed that (at least some) interaction is necessary for obtaining any efficient allocation: no non-interactive (1-round) protocol with polynomial communication (in the number of items and bidders) can achieve approximation ratio better than Omega(m(1/4)), while for any r >= 1, there exists r-round protocols that achieve (O) over tilde (r . m(1/r+1)) approximation with polynomial communication; in particular, O(log m) rounds of interaction suffice to obtain an (almost) efficient allocation, i.e., a polylog(m)-approximation. A natural question at this point is to identify the right level of interaction (i.e., number of rounds) necessary to obtain an efficient allocation. In this paper, we resolve this question by providing an almost tight round-approximation tradeoff for this problem: we show that for any r >= 1, any r-round protocol that uses poly(m, n) bits of communication can only approximate the social welfare up to a factor of Omega(1/r . m(1/2r+1)). This in particular implies that Omega(log m/log log m) rounds of interaction are necessary for obtaining any efficient allocation (i.e., a constant or even a polylog(m)-approximation) in these markets. Our work builds on the recent multi-party round-elimination technique of Alon, Nisan, Raz, and Weinstein (FOCS'15) - used to prove similar-in-spirit lower bounds for round-approximation tradeoff in unit-demand (matching) markets - and settles an open question posed initially by Dobzinski et al., and subsequently by Alon et al.","[Assadi, Sepehr] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Assadi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [CCF-1552909, CCF-1617851, IIS-1447470]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Supported in part by National Science Foundation grants CCF-1552909, CCF-1617851, and IIS-1447470.",,27,15,17,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-4527-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,145,162,,10.1145/3033274.3085121,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BR0CY,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000628648900017,0

How frequently should such a modern batch auction clear? We conduct a systematic simulation-based investigation on the relationship between clearing frequency and metrics of market quality, such as allocative efficiency, comparing the performance of discrete and continuous auction mechanisms under empirical equilibrium behavior of all participating traders. In effect we perform empirical mechanism design on frequent batch auctions. We find that in a wide array of environments, equilibrium efficiency is improved for small positive intervals but falls off dramatically when there are too few opportunities to trade. The result is a large range of batch frequencies that are near optimally efficient; this range is wider in thick markets.","[Brinkman, Erik; Wellman, Michael P.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Brinkman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Wellman, Michael/AAQ-7063-2020","Wellman, Michael/0000-0002-1691-6844",National Science Foundation [IIS-1421391]; Future of Life Institute; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1421391] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1421391] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Future of Life Institute; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),Aaron Pollack contributed to the implementation and exploration of call-market strategies.

At the center of this literature lies the question of whether there exist mechanisms that can implement fair outcomes, despite the agents' strategic behavior. A fundamental objective function used for measuring the fairness of an allocation is the geometric mean of the agents' values, known as the Nash social welfare (NSW). This objective function is maximized by widely known solution concepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equal incomes. In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementing this objective. The starting point of our analysis is the Fisher market, a fundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the (weighted) Nash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes of valuations functions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, and find that for perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism yields a constant approximation: at most 2 and at least e(1/e) (approximate to 1.44). However, for perfect complements, the Fisher market mechanism does not work well, its bound degrading linearly with the number of players. Strikingly, the Trading Post mechanism-an indirect market mechanism also known as the Shapley-Shubik game-has significantly better performance than the Fisher market on its own benchmark. Not only does Trading Post achieve an approximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for any concave utilities, and it becomes essentially optimal for perfect complements, where it reaches (1 + epsilon) for any epsilon > 0. Moreover, we show that all the Nash equilibria of the Trading Post mechanism are pure (hence the approximation factors extend to all Nash equilibria), and satisfy an important notion of individual fairness known as proportionality.","[Branzei, Simina] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Gkatzelis, Vasilis] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mehta, Ruta] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Drexel University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Brânzei, S (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",,,"Gkatzelis, Vasilis/0000-0001-7203-438X","ISF [1435/14]; Israel-USA Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF) [2014389]; I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [740282]; NSF [CCF-1408635, CCF-1216073, CCF-1161813]",ISF(Israel Science Foundation); Israel-USA Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Simina was supported by ISF grant 1435/14 administered by the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Israel-USA Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF) grant 2014389, and the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and The Israel Science Foundation.
