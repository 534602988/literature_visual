Such a trend may be regarded as a result of occasional permanent shocks to the growth rate. This article shows that the trend filtering, which is quite similar to the Hodrick-Prescott filtering and is a type of the recently popular lasso regression, yields almost the same trend estimate, and discusses the reason why this occurs.","[Yamada, Hiroshi] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, Higashihiroshima, Japan",Hiroshima University,"Yamada, H (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, Higashihiroshima, Japan.",yamada@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,,"Yamada, Hiroshi/0000-0001-5560-0319",JSPS KAKENHI [15K13010]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K13010] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 15K13010].,,14,7,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This proposed model combines the essence of the asset-based approach, the income-based approach, and the principle of mean reversion to develop the theoretical closed-form formula consisting of three coefficients: value coefficient, value support coefficient and growth coefficient. Regression analysis is employed to fit market data to determine these coefficients. Moreover, this study proposes the double sorting method to build the quantile regression models of the formula to estimate the stock price at a specific quantile. The results show that the predictive capability of the hybrid valuation model is superior to the model without using value support coefficient, which supports the assumption that the PBR is not associated with the ROE when the ROE is less than a threshold. In different time periods of the stock market, no significant difference exists on the value support coefficient. However, the variations of the value coefficient and the growth coefficient are significant.","[Yeh, I-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lien, Che-hui] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Mkt Int Business & Entrepreneurship, Kamloops, BC, Canada",Tamkang University,"Yeh, IC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, New Taipei, Taiwan.",140910@mail.tku.edu.tw,,"Lien, Che-Hui/0000-0003-4889-6929",,,,,46,4,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By matching manufacturing firms to a blacklist of bribers in the healthcare sector of a province in China, we show that the government-led blacklisting is selective: while economically more visible firms are slightly more likely to be blacklisted, state-controlled firms are the most protected compared to their private and foreign competitors.

The socioeconomic dynamics generate a pendulum-like switch from markets to a centrally planned economy abolishing private ownership, and back to restoring market incentives. The grand experiment of communism is thus characterized as leading to the discovery of a trade-off between equality and efficiency.

While some kinds of inequality, caused by differential rewards to effort, might be associated with faster economic growth, other kinds, arising from unequal opportunities for investment, might be detrimental to economic progress. This study uses two new datasets, consisting of 117 income and expenditure household surveys and 134 Demographic and Health Surveys, to revisit the relationship between total inequality and economic growth. In particular, we ask whether inequality of opportunity, driven by circumstances at birth, has a negative effect on subsequent growth. Using the income and expenditure micro dataset, we find that while both total income inequality and inequality of opportunity are negatively associated with growth, the coefficient estimates are insignificant. The evidence is similarly equivocal using the Demographic and Health Surveys data. On balance, the data do not provide support for the hypothesis that inequality of opportunity is bad for growth.","[Ferreira, Francisco H.

How does competition shape it? How does it shape competition? To address these questions, we develop a model where each firm can freely commit to any observable degree of search obfuscation, which pins down the time cost of searching its product. Consumers have limited time for browsing around websites. This endogenizes consumer information and competition intensity and gives clear predictions about market welfare and surplus division. We find that competition for prominence and the fear of frustrating consumers keeps the negative welfare effects of obfuscation low. However, because obfuscation reduces price awareness and differentiation relaxes price competition, the obfuscation choices in the unique equilibrium are persistently positive and different.

To this end, we consider two integrated firms and one non-integrated retailer that compete in a horizontally differentiated retail market. The non-integrated firm relies on wholesale access provided by one of the integrated firms. Throughout several model variants we find that margin squeeze regulation lowers consumers' surplus. In reverse, firms are likely to benefit from margin squeeze regulation, because it leads to higher retail prices or facilitates tacit collusion. From a total welfare perspective, margin squeeze regulation is only beneficial if it prevents foreclosure of the retailer, but even then, this is due to increased industry profits and at the expense of consumers' surplus. These results question current European policy initiatives to augment the role of ex ante margin squeeze tests in sector-specific regulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These population groups, originating mainly from western Europe and secondly from North America, want to share their yearly stay between their home country and one or several desirable places for a long term; this phenomenon was called 'residential tourism'. Also, during the 1990s and after, a new movement of foreigners began to take place in Greece; a large number of economic migrants came in the beginning from the countries of the previous eastern socialist Europe and after from Asian and African war zones, aiming to find work in hard conditions. As an outcome, the insular space of the Aegean Sea and especially the Cyclades complex received a significant part of this double migratory flow.

The objective of this work is to determine the impact of technological innovations in the short and long term. In all the developed countries, the unemployed are rather low-skilled whereas highly skilled employees face less unemployment problems. Several studies have shown that technical progress leads to the casualization of non-skilled labor and to unemployment. This idea is based on the substitution of capital at work. Moreover, technical progress requires a skilled workforce capable of creating, innovating, and controlling further progress. Thus, technological innovations are not neutral; there are skill-biased technological changes. However, according to the theory of compensation, technological innovations reduce short-term employment (replacement effect) but create it in the medium and long term (compensation effect). The empirical validation of this work is based on the technique of structural VECM for the case of Tunisia. Unlike the theory of compensation, our results support the fact that the short-term effect of technological innovations on employment is positive; however, in the medium and long term, it is negative.","[Mnif, Sirine; Feki, Chiraz; Abdelkafi, Ines] Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Dept Econ, Rd Airport Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,"Mnif, S (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Dept Econ, Rd Airport Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",mnifsirine@hotmail.fr; fekichiraz@yahoo.fr; Inesabdelkafi@yahoo.fr,"ABDELKAFI, Ines/GZA-6483-2022",,,,,,57,3,3,7,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

These outcomes are compared to those which result from the behavior of selfish agents. A variant of Fehr-Schmidt preferences is employed that allows the externality from agents who are ahead to differ in magnitude from the externality from those who are behind in the income distribution. We find first, that inequality-averse preferences yield distributional outcomes that are analogous to tax-transfer schemes with selfish agents, and may either increase or decrease average consumption. Second, in a society of inequality-averse agents, a linear income tax can be welfare-enhancing. Third, inequality-averse preferences can lead to less redistribution at any given tax, with low-wage agents receiving smaller net subsidies and/or high-wage individuals paying less in net taxes. Finally, an inequality-averse median voter may prefer higher redistribution even if it means less utility from own consumption and leisure.","[Murray, Matthew N.; Santore, Rudy] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Stokely Management Ctr 505A, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Peng, Langchuan] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Nanjing Audit University,"Peng, LC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Econ & Finance, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",mmurray1@utk.edu; langchaun-peng@126.com; rsantore@utk.edu,,"Peng, Langchuan/0000-0001-9253-2378",,,,,30,0,0,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Considering the important role played by Italy in this industry, this paper aims at providing a measure of the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry at regional level, focusing on positioning of Piedmont, a manufacturing vocation region. Despite the important role played by Italian manufacturing, literature concerning the creation of a synthetic regional index of this type of competitiveness is practically nonexistent. The paper bridges this gap throughout the development of a global index of regional competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. Methodology consists in a systematic analysis of drivers supported by literature at the base of the competitiveness of the regional manufacturing industry and in the validation of results by means of three focus groups composed of 30 stakeholders belonging to different organizations in two phases (Delphi method). Results show a system of measure based on eight competitive drivers, and its application to the Italian and Piedmont system highlights a strong heterogeneity among regions; this shows how Italian manufacturing industry depends on a few highly competitive regional systems and emphasizes the first position of Piedmont in this field. The creation of a ranking of the Italian regional systems on the base of the competitiveness of their manufacturing industry allows to draw important developing strategies.

To do so, we propose a structural VAR that allows us to break down changes in main macroeconomic variables into different structural shocks. From a policy perspective, the estimation of the structural shocks allows us to simulate a counterfactual scenario, whereby we conclude that the effects of less rigid labour market are positive and significant.

Relatively less attention has been paid to the impact that financial development of a country can have on important development outcomes like transparency. As established by existing research, strong financial institutions in a country would imply an improved and transparent banking system, better corporate governance, ease of accessing credit, greater availability of information and best practices in investment protection. All these should theoretically promise a more transparent economic system. Our empirical findings confirm this. Using several estimation strategies, our results confirm that greater financial development enhances transparency.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Mukherjee, Deepraj] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Mukherjee, D (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",ndutta@uwlax.edu; dmukherj@kent.edu,"MUKHERJEE, DEEPRAJ/ABI-7532-2020; Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019","MUKHERJEE, DEEPRAJ/0000-0002-2032-477X; Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217",,,,,67,10,10,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

Participants state their willingness-to-pay for both a fair trade and a conventional chocolate bar in private or publicly. A standard model of social image predicts that all participants increase their fair trade premium when facing an audience. We find that the premium is indeed higher in public than in private. This effect, however, is driven by participants who preferred a conventional chocolate bar over a fair trade one in a pre-lab choice. For those who chose the fair trade chocolate bar, public exposure does not change the fair trade premium. This is captured by a generalized model where intrinsic preferences and the concern for social approval are negatively correlated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Hold-up concerns have led to ancillary good regulations, such as transparency and price caps. The hold-up narrative, however, runs counter to evidence in many retail settings where ancillary good prices are set below cost (e.g., free shipping or limited card surcharging in countries where the no-surcharge rule was lifted). We argue that the key to unifying these conflicting narratives is that the seller may absorb partly or fully the ancillary good's cost so as not to miss sales on the basic good. A supplier with market power on the ancillary good market then takes advantage of cost absorption and jacks up its wholesale price. Hold-ups occur only when consumers are initially uninformed or naive about the drip price and shopping costs are high. The price of the basic good then acts as a signal of the drip price, since a high markup on the basic good makes the firm more wary of missed sales. Regardless of whether consumers are informed, uninformed but rational, or naive, mandating price transparency and banning loss-making on the ancillary good leads to (i) an efficient consumption of the ancillary good, and (ii) a reduction of its wholesale price, generating strict welfare gains.","[Gomes, Renato] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France; Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, IAST, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gomes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France.",,,,"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [759733]; ERC [249429, 669217]; European Research Council (ERC) [669217, 759733, 249429] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"An earlier article titled Shrouded Transaction Costs was split into the present article and a paper written in collaboration with Helene Bourguignon.

We show the discount factor can be generically identified jointly with the payoff parameters. On the other hand, it is known the payoff function cannot be nonparametrically identified without any a priori restrictions. Our identification of the discount factor is robust to any normalization choice on the payoff parameters. In IO applications, normalizations are usually made on switching costs, such as entry costs and scrap values. We also show that switching costs can be nonparametrically identified, in closed-form, independently of the discount factor and other parts of the payoff function. Our identification strategies are constructive. They lead to easy to compute estimands that are global solutions.

We especially focus on educational performance for the children of the involved single mothers. For these children, average school grades at age 16 dropped significantly by 0.7% of a standard deviation per additional year that their mothers were exposed to the reform. Furthermore, we find that the reform affected single mothers by increasing their working hours (and thereby reducing their time at home). We find no average effect on disposable income (mothers traded off reductions in benefits with increases in earnings). Thus, reduced parental time at home seems to be the main mechanism for the observed moderate drop in children's grades.

This paper investigates whether China's 2008 tax policy change affected inward foreign direct investment. In contrast to previous studies, we break foreign investment down into suspect and real foreign investment using firm-level data from 1998 to 2008 and conduct a difference-in-difference estimation to determine the effect of the tax policy change on both types of foreign investment and compare these to the effect on domestic investment. The results show that the 2008 tax policy change reduced the amount of suspect foreign investment and its effect on real foreign investment was insignificant, indicating that foreign firms in China are more concerned with the investment environment and economic stability than taxes. Therefore, China should create a regulated business environment instead of readopting supernational treatment for foreign enterprises.","[Luo, Zhi] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Econ Dev Res, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Beijing Normal University,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",luozhi@whu.edu.cn; wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn; zhangxun@bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773084, 71373186]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Zhi Luo, Associate Professor, Center for Economic Development Research, Wuhan University, China.

The empirical method used is quantile regression analysis. In addition, we allow for structural breaks and asymmetry by differentiating between positive and negative oil price changes. Unlike OLS analysis, quantile regression allows the coefficient estimates to vary throughout the distribution of the dependent variable, which provides a complete picture of the relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable. Our results suggest that the coefficient estimates have not been constant throughout the distribution of stock returns; that oil price shocks have asymmetrical effects on stock returns; and that the effects of oil price shocks on stock market returns are affected by stock market conditions. Overall, the results suggest that rising oil prices increase stock returns only when stock markets are bullish (high quantiles) and normal (medium quantiles), and that falling oil prices lower stock returns only when stock markets are bearish (low quantiles) and normal (medium quantiles). This suggests that oil and stock markets are more likely to boom together or crash together.","[Nusair, Salah A.; Al-Khasawneh, Jamal A.] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 7207, Hawally 32093, Kuwait",Gulf University for Science & Technology (GUST),"Nusair, SA (通讯作者)，Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 7207, Hawally 32093, Kuwait.",nusair.s@gust.edu.kw; AlKhasawneh.J@gust.edu.kw,"Nusair, Salah A/J-1274-2019","Nusair, Salah A/0000-0002-9601-5164; Al-Khasawneh, Jamal/0000-0003-3838-5578",,,,,63,19,19,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

In the basic model, I show that given strong heterogeneity in consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) and a moderately small consumer segment with low WTP, sequential moving outcomes can appear in equilibrium with the follower enjoying second-mover advantage. Owing to consumer heterogeneity in WTP, there is a local property that a firm's aggressive behaviour may lead to a competitor responding more aggressively. Hence, the sequential moves can restrict firms' total outputs to avoid a price collapse, and result in firms' strategic choices that Pareto dominate those under the simultaneous move. I further generalize my results and show that although firms compete in quantity, under some conditions of the demand function, features of strategic complements can appear.","[Pan, Cong] Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Business Sch, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Nagoya University of Commerce & Business,"Pan, C (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Business Sch, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",cong_pan@nucba.ac.jp,,"Pan, Cong/0000-0002-8334-9093","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J05223, 18K12767]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18K12767, 15J05223] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is based on some part of the author's paper Should brand firms always take pioneering position?, ISER discussion paper no. 938, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University, June 2015.

An empirical study estimated the contribution of the interest rate shocks to the variance in output growth at 5.1% in Mexico within the framework of stochastic growth models for small open economies. We replicate this study with the same dataset and investigate which parameters affect the contribution of the interest rate shocks to business cycles. Then, we estimate the same model for different emerging economies to investigate the relationship between the corruption level and macroeconomic contribution of the interest rate shocks. For this purpose, we use Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to measure the corruption level. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the CPI and the estimated series of the interest rate shock. Our findings are as follows. First, the average size of the interest rate shocks is positively associated with the contribution of these shocks to the variability of output growth. Second, the average size of the interest rate shocks is also positively associated with the corruption level. Third, the estimated interest rate shock and the corruption level are positively correlated with each other. As we treat the corruption level as an exogenous variable in the model, these findings lead us to accept the hypothesis. The Appendix further clarifies a well-known hypothesis that the cycle is the trend in an emerging economy.","[Suzuki, Tomoya] Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka 5648680, Japan",Kansai University,"Suzuki, T (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka 5648680, Japan.",tomoya@kansai-u.ac.jp,"Suzuki, Tomoya/AAL-4315-2021","Suzuki, Tomoya/0000-0002-9462-7511",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JSPS KAKENHI [16K03683]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03683] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author would like thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments.

To investigate the distributive properties of monetary policy the authors resort to an agent-based macroeconomic model where firms, households and one bank interact on the basis of limited information and adaptive rules-of-thumb. Simulations show that the model can replicate fairly well a number of stylized facts, especially those relative to the business cycle. The authors address the issue using three types of computational experiments, including a global sensitivity analysis carried out through a novel methodology which greatly reduces the computational burden of simulations. The result emerges that a more restrictive monetary policy increases inequality, even though this effect may differ across groups of households.

J,"Cook, A; Ehrlich, I",,,,"Cook, Adam; Ehrlich, Isaac",,,Was higher education a major channel through which the US became an economic superpower in the 20th century?,JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Human capital; endogenous growth; Morrill Act; higher education; treatment effects; US,INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS,"This paper offers a thesis for why the US overtook the UK and other European countries in the 20th century in both aggregate and per capita GDP as a case study of recent models of endogenous growth, where 'human capital' is the engine of growth. By human capital we mean an intangible asset, best thought of as a stock of embodied and disembodied knowledge comprising education, information, entrepreneurship, and productive and innovative skills, which is formed through investments in schooling, job training, and health as well as through research and development projects and informal knowledge transfers (cf. Ehrlich and Murphy 2007). The conjecture is that the ascendancy of the US as an economic superpower in the 20th century owes considerably to its faster human capital formation relative to that of the UK and 'old Europe.' This paper assesses whether the thesis has legs to stand on through both stylized facts and a supplementary quasi-experimental empirical analysis. The stylized facts indicate that the US led other major developed countries in schooling attainments per adult population member, beginning in the latter part of the 19th century and lasting throughout the 20th century, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels. The quasi-experimental analysis constitutes the first attempt to test the hypothesis that the US's ascendancy to a major economic power stems largely from the impact of the first Morrill Act of 1862, which launched the public higher education movement in the US through the establishment of land grant colleges and universities across the nation during the latter part of the 19th century. The higher education movement appears to have spearheaded a higher long-term rate of growth in per capita income in the US relative to the UK and other major European countries.","[Cook, Adam] SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] IZA, Bonn, Germany",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Fredonia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Cook, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA.",cook@fredonia.edu,,"Cook, Adam/0000-0002-0064-1399",,,,,34,2,4,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Considering competition between two groups of different size, we show that the small group's sharing rule is a strategic complement to the large group's sharing rule in the sense that if the small group chooses a more meritocratic sharing rule, the large group wishes to choose a more meritocratic rule as well. On the contrary, the large group's sharing rule is a strategic substitute to the small group's sharing rule, hence the timing of choice is crucial. For sufficiently private prizes, a switch from a simultaneous choice to the small group being the leader consists in a Pareto improvement and reduces aggregate effort. On the contrary, when the large group is the leader, aggregate effort increases. As a result, the equilibrium timing is such that the small group chooses its sharing rule first. If the prize is not private enough, the small group retires from the competition and switching from a simultaneous to a sequential timing may reverse the results in terms of aggregate effort. The sequential timing also guarantees that the small group never outperforms the large one.","[Balart, Pau] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Carretera Valldemossa, Palma De Mallorca 07022, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Guertler, Oliver] Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Troumpounis, Orestis] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Cologne; Lancaster University,"Balart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Carretera Valldemossa, Palma De Mallorca 07022, Spain.",pau.balart@uib.cat; sabine.flamand@urv.cat; oliver.guertler@unikoeln.de; o.troumpounis@lancaster.ac.uk,"Gürtler, Oliver/AAX-6418-2021; Balart, Pau/I-4213-2019","Gürtler, Oliver/0000-0001-7792-5325; Balart, Pau/0000-0002-9088-537X; Troumpounis, Orestis/0000-0003-1074-863X","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO201786305-C4-1-R, ECO2015-67171-P, ECO2016-75410-P]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant/Award Numbers ECO201786305-C4-1-R (AEI/ERDF, EU), ECO2015-67171-P, ECO2016-75410-P",,52,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Different measures of wealth inequality were also lower than elsewhere. Yet, there were revolutions in four countries and protests in several others. We explain this so-called inequality puzzle by first noting that, despite favorable income inequality measures, subjective well-being measures in Arab countries were relatively low and falling sharply, especially for the middle class, and in the countries where the uprisings were most intense. The increasing unhappiness, reflected in perceptions of declining standards of living, was associated with dissatisfaction with the quality of public services, the shortage of formal-sector jobs, and corruption. These sources of dissatisfaction suggest that the old social contract, where government provided jobs, free education and health, and subsidized food and fuel, in return for the subdued voice of the population, was broken. The Arab Spring and its aftermath indicates the need for a new social contract, one where government promotes private-sector jobs and accountability in service delivery, and citizens are active participants in the economy and society.","[Devarajan, Shantayanan; Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Devarajan, S (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sdevarajan@worldbank.org,"Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021",,,,,,35,32,34,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We calibrate a model of the Eurasian gas network and distinguish between two steps of the reform: first, the opening of access to transit pipes and second, the opening of access to distribution systems, hence customers. Using the Shapley Value as a power index, we find a modest and rather heterogeneous impact from the first step. The impact of the second step is much larger and yields a clear pattern: all local champions lose, while all customers and all outside players gain. As one third of the losses of champions within EU leaks to players abroad, current reforms might enhance the dominance of already powerful outside producers. When network power is assessed with the nucleolus, in contrast, full liberalization of access to customers does not benefit outside producers at all. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Identification is complicated by parental preferences: if parents prefer certain sex compositions over others, children' s gender affects not only the outcomes of other children but also the existence of potential additional children. We employ two empirical strategies that both address this problem. First, we use a large sample of singletons to estimate whether first-borns are affected by the gender of their second-born sibling. Second, we look at a sample of dizygotic (i.e. non-identical) twins. We find that a same-sex sibling increases men's earnings and family formation outcomes (marriage and fertility), as compared to an opposite-sex sibling. The results for women are similar but the effects are smaller in magnitude and less robust. We argue that the income result for men could be driven by competition between brothers, as we find that men with brothers choose higher paying occupations. For women, we find suggestive evidence that the income premium may come partly from lower unemployment, which could be due to shared job search networks. The effects on family formation might stem from differential parental treatment for men, and from competition between sisters for women.","[Peter, Noemi] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Lundborg, Petter; Mikkelsen, Sara] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter; Webbink, Dinand] Erasmus Sch Econ Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lundborg, Petter; Webbink, Dinand] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Webbink, Dinand] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Lund University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Tinbergen Institute,"Peter, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",a.n.peter@rug.nl; petter.lundborg@nek.lu.se; sara.mikkelsen@nck.lu.se; webbink@ese.eur.nl,,"Peter, Noemi/0000-0002-2743-4883","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life, and Welfare, FORTE [2010-0745]","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life, and Welfare, FORTE","We are grateful to Hessel Oosterbeek, Erik Plug, Thomas Buser, Paul J.

Indeed, sustainable agricultural development is particularly important in China due to limits on resources and the presence of the largest population in the world. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition of the overall inefficiency into three components of technical, mix, and scale effects at aggregate level by allowing for desirable and undesirable outputs in a non-parametric framework. We empirically investigate economic and environmental performance associated with resource misallocation (represented by input/output mix) in Chinese agricultural sector across the 31 provinces over the period 1997-2014. Our results show that average overall inefficiency in Chinese agricultural sector is 9.13% during the sample period, which suggests there exists a 7.94% possible improvement for gross output value and 1.19% potential reduction for carbon emission. Moreover, we find inefficiency is mainly due to the mix effect that requires an improvement in reallocation of inputs and this may be related to the ongoing supply side structural reforms in China. We also present a dual model of by-production technology for shadow price analysis and report upward trended carbon abatement costs in Chinese agriculture.","[Shen, Zhiyang] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, 962 CaoShan RD, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China; [Shen, Zhiyang] China Eximbank, 30 FuXingMenNei RD, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos Str 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Chen, Xueli] China Radio Int, 16A ShiJingShan RD, Beijing 100040, Peoples R China; [Valdmanis, Vivian] Western Michigan Univ, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Valdmanis, Vivian] IESEG Sch Management, F-59000 Lille, France",Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Western Michigan University; IESEG School of Management,"Shen, ZY (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, 962 CaoShan RD, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",zhiyang86@163.com,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015; SHEN, Zhiyang/AAY-7556-2021","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711; SHEN, Zhiyang/0000-0002-5126-6461; CHEN, Xueli/0000-0003-0758-5243",China Scholarship Council [201308070020]; IESEG School of Management; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA216],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); IESEG School of Management; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),We would like to thank Executive Editor Belton M.

We open the black box of matching technology, by modelling how agents behave (make proposals) according to their information perception. We observe more efficient results-in the form of a downward shift of the Beverage curve in the case of simple zero-intelligent agents. Our comparative statics indicate that market conditions, such as the heterogeneity of agents' preferences, will also shift the Beveridge curve downwards. Moreover, market thickness affects movement along the Beverage curve. Movement right-down along the curve if there is an increasing number of agents compared to positions within firms. Furthermore, we show that frictions in re-matching, such as commitment to a match, could be another factor shifting the Beveridge curve toward the origin.","[Veski, Andre] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Poder, Kaire] Estonian Business Sch, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology; Estonian Business School,"Veski, A (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",andre.veski@ttu.ee; kaire.poder@ebs.ee,"Põder, Kaire/N-6189-2019; Põder, Kaire/IAN-8847-2023","Põder, Kaire/0000-0001-6578-4852; Veski, Andre/0000-0003-1495-6292",,,,,54,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Evidence from a multiple bubble test,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hub pricing; Bubbles; Natural gas; Oil indexation,CRUDE-OIL; MARKET FUNDAMENTALS; PRICES; ENERGY; STOCK; FINANCIALIZATION; BEHAVIOR; FUTURES; IMPACT; SHOCKS,"Oil indexation and hub-based pricing are two competing pricing mechanisms in the international natural gas markets. The debates over whether hub-based pricing is preferable to oil indexation have become intense among academics and practitioners, for example, whether and when East Asia should adopt hub pricing. This paper contributes empirically to the debate using a multiple bubble test. Adopting the generalized sup augmented Dickey-Fuller test proposed by Phillips et al. (2015), we show that more explosive bubbles exist in Japan and European gas prices than in the US prices. The argument is that hub-based pricing mechanism can better reflect fundamental values in the gas markets and thus is less subject to speculations. Given the recent trend of financialization in energy markets, gas prices are more likely to deviate from fundamental values when they are not clear to investors. Although oil indexation is simple and has been an effective tool over the past few decades, our results suggest that hub pricing is associated with less extreme price movements in the market and thus is a better choice for both policy makers and practitioners.

This survey provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the causal mechanisms between religion and development discussed and tested in the economics literature, and reviews quantitative empirical evidence on the actual effects of religion on economic and social dimensions of development. We start by disaggregating the concept of religion into four religious dimensions and propose a framework to conceptualize causal mechanisms. Numerous mechanisms are possible but only a few uncontested findings exist. Religion is ambivalent vis-a-vis development: although religious ideas can foster certain forms of human capital acquisition and labor market participation, scholars have found a negative relationship between religious dimensions and both income and gender equality as well as innovation activities. Religious identity is also a source of labor market discrimination and has ambivalent effects on economic growth and social cohesion. Methodological challenges refer to the availability of fine-grained data, especially for developing countries, the use of concepts and definitions, and the lack of causal inference.","[Basedau, Matthias; Gobien, Simone; Prediger, Sebastian] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Hamburg, Germany",German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Prediger, S (通讯作者)，GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Hamburg, Germany.",Sebastian.prediger@giga-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,We thank Anna Wolkenhauer for excellent research assistance.

When the asset pledgeability is low, the down payment is high, and bubble investment is unleveraged, as in a standard rational bubble model. When the pledgeability is high, the down payment is low, making it easier for leveraged borrowers to invest in the bubbly asset. As loans are packaged together into a competitive pool, the pricing of individual default risk may facilitate risk-taking. In equilibrium, credit-constrained borrowers may optimally choose a risky leveraged investment strategy - borrow to invest in the bubbly asset and default if the bubble bursts. The model predicts joint boom-bust cycles in asset prices and securitized credit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The findings support the idea that fiscal policy reduces (but does not eliminate) ethnic gaps. This result is led by health care and educational transfers, and to a lesser degree by direct transfers. We do not consider quality issues with public services, which may affect the estimated narrowing of gaps.

We find that: (1) the aggregate and the majority of two-digit mark-ups behave pro-cyclically; and (2) the trend in margins of profits in the period is explained by a marked rise in the rate of surplus value and a fall in the composition of capital, indicating labor-saving/capital-using technical change.

We show that social comparisons of consumption lead to excessive labor supply for employed workers, but trade unionism results in under-employment. When conspicuous consumption meets trade unionism, the labor force exhibits an intensive margin under which the excessive labor supply caused by social comparisons of consumption is restrained by unionization. Conspicuous consumption can then achieve the social sub-optimum, without a need for government intervention, creating no distortions in consumption, capital accumulation, and output in a competitive equilibrium. When social comparisons in consumption are more intensive, a higher degree of unionization is required for restoring optimality. Given a specific degree of social comparison in consumption, a higher degree of unionization is socially desirable if the output elasticity of labor, the elasticity of labor supply, or the elasticity of substitution between working hours and employment is high. By contrast, a lower degree of unionization is socially desirable when the trade union displays a more favorable orientation toward wages. By shedding light on the role of trade unionism, our study also provides a reconciliation of the disparity between the theoretical prediction and the empirical findings.","[Chang, Juin-jen; Wang, Wei-neng] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Nankang, Taiwan; [Liu, Chia-ying] Aletheia Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Aletheia University,"Chang, JJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Nankang, Taiwan.",jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank the co-editor, an anonymous referee, Been-Lon Chen, Jang-Ting Guo, and Ching-Chong Lai for their helpful suggestions and insightful comments on an earlier version of this paper, whose inputs have led to a much improved paper.

We find that stickers with short, targeted messages on the packaging increase adherence by 9% and reduce untaken pills by 29%. However, the currently used method of boosting adherence through costly, specialized packaging with pictorial instructions had no significant impacts relative to the standard control package. We develop a theoretical framework of the adherence decision, highlighting the role of symptoms, beliefs about being cured, and beliefs about drug effectiveness to help interpret our results.

Assessing prior authorization as a tool to prevent high-risk prescriptions and to lower costs,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Prior authorization; Prescription drug abuse; Workers' compensation; Health care spending; Prescribing behavior,MEDICARE PART D; REGRESSION-DISCONTINUITY DESIGN; DRUG-MONITORING PROGRAMS; COMPENSATION CLAIM COST; OPIOID ANALGESIC ABUSE; LOW-BACK-PAIN; WORKERS-COMPENSATION; HEALTH-INSURANCE; UNITED-STATES; OVERDOSE MORTALITY,"Insurers are increasingly requiring physicians to obtain prior authorization before prescribing drugs that are costly or have high abuse potential. These prior authorization requirements have the potential to reduce risky prescriptions and to lower prescription drug costs, but little is known about their ability to do either. This study estimates the effect of a prior authorization requirement for certain costly and abuse-prone drugs on prescription drug use and costs for work-related injuries in Texas. The findings indicate that the prior authorization requirement reduces the likelihood that claimants receive non-preferred drugs as well as insurers' spending on non-preferred drugs. While there is some substitution to preferred drugs, I do not find evidence of large increases in spending on preferred drugs. The estimated effects on average total pharmacy spending are imprecise, though there is suggestive evidence that the prior authorization requirement reduces the likelihood that a claim has high prescription drug costs. The results provide strong evidence that the prior authorization requirement drastically reduces the likelihood that patients receive combinations of drugs that have contributed disproportionately to the rise in prescription drug overdoses. Despite the success of prior authorization in lowering spending on non-preferred drugs and in reducing high-risk prescriptions, I find little evidence that prior authorization has disproportionately large effects on the most dangerous prescription drug use and only weak, suggestive evidence that it has larger effects on prescription drug use that likely arises because physicians are not fully informed, suggesting that prior authorization requirements do not necessarily target the riskiest drug use.

Covariances of income levels and future growth rates therefore have strong identifying power for HIP. We show that adding such moments to an estimation can reverse seemingly strong evidence of HIP. We show this both in a small sample Monte Carlo study and using PSID data. Our results are robust to including a fixed effect correlated with the HIP component. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It argues that monetary policy at the ELB can be potent and that there has thus far been no convincing evidence that it has greater international spillovers through capital flows and exchange rates than comparable adjustments in interest rates. It may be more challenging to raise rates off the ELB than to raise rates from higher levels-possibly due to counterbalancing effects through the exchange rate-although there are only anecdotes to support this stickiness rather than any formal, empirical evidence.","[Forbes, Kristin] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Forbes, K (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,2,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Until very recently, scholars using various datasets have shown that residents of post-communist countries were significantly less satisfied with their lives than their counterparts in non-transition countries (controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics). The literature has explained this finding by the great macroeconomic instability of the 1990s, by a substantial decrease in the quality and accessibility of public goods, by the major increase in inequality, and by the rapid depreciation of pre-transition human capital. All these factors were expected to subside over time at least after the post-Great-Recession recovery. In this paper, we consider two most recent datasets the third wave of the Life in Transition Survey (administered in 2015-16) and the 2010-2016 waves of the annual Gallup World Poll. We find that by 2016 the transition happiness gap had closed. This convergence has taken place both due to a happiness recovery in post-communist countries after the Great Recession and due to a decrease in life satisfaction in comparator countries in recent years. We also find that the convergence in life satisfaction was primarily driven by middle-income young, educated individuals, regardless of gender.","[Guriev, Sergei] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London, England; [Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Guriev, Sergei] CEPR, London, England; [Melnikov, Nikita] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",European Bank of Reconstructon & Development; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University,"Guriev, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",sergei.guriev@sciencespo.fr,"Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169",,,,,12,20,21,0,17,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

This paper is mainly concerned with two questions: First, is the Dutch housing market localized? Second, to which factors can we trace back this localization? We find that the Dutch housing market is highly localized. Although there is an important common housing cycle explaining house price comovement across all regions, idiosyncratic factors play the most important role. Although notably, group specific factors, separating Randstad of non-Randstad regions, are only of minor importance. Nevertheless, they can explain region-specific housing supply shocks.

Upon further investigation, these results were driven by an error that inappropriately calculated differences across counties (and years) in the dataset. This error has been acknowledged by the author. When corrected, the specification in the original paper produces no statistical significance for any of the broadband variables of interest. Thus, the reported finding of a positive association between broadband speed and employment is not valid. This updated result is in agreement with several other studies using the first-differenced methodology and county-level data from the U.S., and suggests that more work needs to be done to refine existing models and units of analysis to uncover the relationship (if one exists) between broadband speed and employment.

The diversified and changing nature of works in this field warrants us to stocktake, identify changes, and map out KM research framework for future exploration. The study involves three aspects. First, three stages of KM research in construction were distinguished in terms of the time distribution of 217 target publications. Major topics in the stages were extracted for understanding the changes of research emphasis from evolutionary perspective. Second, the past works were summed up in a three-dimensional research framework in terms of management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective. Finally, potential research orientations in the future were predicted to expand the existing research framework. It was found that (1) KM research has significantly blossomed in the last two decades with a great potential; (2) major topics of KM were changing in terms of technology, technique, organization, attribute of knowledge, and research objectives; (3) past KM studies centred around management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective, thus a three-dimensional research framework was proposed; (4) within the research framework, team-level, project-level, and firm-level KM were studied to achieve project, organizational, and competitive objectives by integrated methodologies of information technology, social technique, and KM process tool; and (5) nine potential research orientations were predicted corresponding to the three dimensions. Finally, an expanded research framework was proposed to encourage and guide future research works in this field. The paper only focused on the construction industry. The findings need further exploration in order to discover any possible missing important research works which were not published in English or not included in the time period. The paper formed a systematic framework of KM research in construction and predicted the potential research orientations. It provides much value for the researchers who want to understand the past and the future of global KM research in the construction industry.","[Yu, Dengke] Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 999 Xuefu Rd, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jay] Queensland Univ Technol, Sci & Engn Fac, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Nanchang University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Yu, DK (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 999 Xuefu Rd, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yudengke@ncu.edu.cn; j.yang@qut.edu.au,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201072, 71563027]; China Scholarship Council",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71201072 and 71563027).

First, we try to understand the reasons that explain the decision made by companies with UK cross-listing to cross-list their shares in the US. Second, we study the impact of cross-listing on value creation. Our results shown that the motivations for such decision are related to the improvement of stock price informativeness and investor protection interests. Firms may also be motivated by reasons related to the global business strategy. However, the commitment to additional higher disclosure requirements and geographic proximity act negatively on the decision to cross-list. By applying a methodology taking into account the endogeneity of the cross-listing decision, we found results that support the positive effect of cross-listing on performance. The finding also revealed the existence of an indirect impact of the cross-listing decision through its determinants on performance. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Different solutions have been suggested to curb poverty. Economic growth and financial development are two such crucial tools for overcoming poverty, as frequently pointed out by economists. These tools work through the so-called trickle-down hypothesis, which contends that a well-functioning financial system would enhance poverty reduction by promoting economic growth. One country that appears to have manifested this hypothesis is China. However, the empirical test of the trickle-down hypothesis for China is scant. In addition, most of the existing studies have failed to account for regime-shift in parameters or structural breaks. This paper attempts to fill this void by testing the trickle-down hypothesis for China during the period 1985-2014. We utilized two standard proxies for financial development, namely: the domestic credit to private sector by banks as percentage of GDP, and money and quasi money as percentage of GDP; annual percentage change in real GDP per capita to proxy economic growth; and a standard proxy for poverty reduction namely: the household final consumption expenditure per capita growth. By accounting for structural breaks in our empirical specifications, we found overwhelming support for the trickle-down hypothesis at the national level. That is, we found financial development to cause economic growth, which in turn causes poverty reduction in China at the national level. This has important policy implications.","[Ho, Sin-Yu] Univ South Africa, UNISA, Dept Econ, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa; [Iyke, Bernard Njindan] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Finance, 221 Burwood Highway,Melbourne Burwood Campus, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",University of South Africa; Deakin University,"Iyke, BN (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Finance, 221 Burwood Highway,Melbourne Burwood Campus, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",hosy@unisa.ac.za; benitoflex@gmail.com,"Ho, Sin-Yu/AAH-1637-2021","Ho, Sin-Yu/0000-0003-0032-1616",,,,,86,35,35,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

Teachers receiving access alone increased students' math achievement by a marginally significant 0.06 of a standard deviation. Teachers who received access and support increased students' math achievement by 0.09 of a standard deviation. Weaker teachers experience larger gains, suggesting that these lessons substitute for teacher skill or efforts. The online materials are more scalable and cost effective than most policies aimed at improving teacher quality, suggesting that, if search costs can be overcome, there is a real benefit to making high-quality instructional materials available to teachers on the Internet.

In a two-period electoral campaign with two policy issues, an incumbent and a possibly more competent challenger compete for election by voters who are heterogeneously informed about the state of the world. Due to the asymmetries in government responsibility between candidates, the incumbent's statement may convey information on the relevance of the issues to voters. In equilibrium, the incumbent sometimes strategically releases his statement early and thus signals the importance of his signature issue to the voters. We find that, since the incumbent's positioning on the issue reveals private information which the challenger can use in later statements, the incumbent's incentives to distort the campaign are decreasing in his quality, as previously documented by the empirical literature. The distortions arising in equilibrium are decreasing in the incumbent's true competence; however, the distortions may be increasing in the incumbent's expected competence on his signature issue.","[Manzoni, Elena] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Penczynski, Stefan P.] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Mannheim,"Penczynski, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",stefan.penczynski@uni-mannheim.de,,"Penczynski, Stefan Peter/0000-0001-5477-6830; Manzoni, Elena/0000-0003-0223-8760",PRIN,"PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We thank Madhav Aney, Leonardo Felli, Giovanna Iannantuoni, Gilat Levy, Andrea Mattozzi, Michele Piccione, Ronny Razin and participants of the 3rd GRASS Workshop, the 5th CESIfo Workshop on Political Economy and the SFB 884 Workshop on the Political Economy of Reforms in Mannheim.

However, this kind of intervention may also create Protection for Sale conditions in the market-which might, in turn, lead to an inefficient resource allocation. This paper examines the effect of an indirect intervention on regulated market welfare under Optimal Regulation and Protection for Sale conditions. Although under Optimal Regulation conditions there is zero welfare-loss as it derives from Differential Price Policy (DPP), it seems that under substantial Protection for Sale conditions this price policy increases the welfare-loss, and therefore a Uniform Price Policy (UPP) might achieve a smaller welfare-loss-due to the free-riding effect. Furthermore, this paper suggests that in between these two price policies lays a third option, a Combined Price Policy, that can balance between the accurate resource allocation (DPP) and the political pressure reduction (UPP) in order to reduce the welfare-loss and to increase the market efficiency.","[Nisani, Doron] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Nisani, D (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",doron.nisani@mail.huji.ac.il,"Nisani, Doron/HLW-5160-2023","Nisani, Doron/0000-0002-1392-614X",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"The author thanks Prof. Israel Finkelshtain and Dr. Iddo Kan for their guidance.

It presents an applied general equilibrium model which combines the theoretical foundations of an Eaton-Kortum (EK) model of international trade with the comprehensiveness of a global multi-region, multi-sector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of production and consumption. The EK model features endogenous Ricardian productivity gains and non-tariff trade costs. Countries and sectors can be disaggregated, e.g. representing federal states and technology-specific power generation. The model calibration introduces a log-multiplicative structural estimation approach based on a gravity model with market clearing conditions to simultaneously estimate the EK model's trade elasticity, productivities and iceberg trade costs at the subnational sectoral level. Based on these estimates, policy simulations are carried out, in which the effect of climate and trade policy on CO2 emissions is decomposed into a scale, composition, technique and substitution effect. The policy simulations suggest that the removal of tariffs creates smaller welfare gains than a comparable reduction of non-tariff barriers but also a slightly smaller increase in European and global CO2 emissions, mainly via substitution and composition effects. The effects significantly differ between national and subnational model regions. Lower trade costs reduce the negative welfare effects of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for some of its members by lowering emissions. EU renewable energy support slightly reduces European and global emissions but also welfare compared to the EU ETS alone. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This is done by studying the precision of out-of-sample forecasts from Bayesian VAR models using a sample of quarterly data from 1996 to 2016. It is found that the inclusion of inflation expectations in the models tends to improve forecast precision. However, the improvement is typically small enough that it could be described as economically irrelevant. One exception can possibly be found in the expectations of businesses in the National Institute of Economic Research's Economic Tendency Survey; when included in the models, these improve forecast precision in a meaningful way at short horizons. Taken together, it seems that the inflation expectations studied here do not provide a silver bullet for those who try to improve VAR-based forecasts of Swedish inflation. The largest benefits from using these survey expectations may instead perhaps be found among analysts and policy makers; they can after all provide relevant information concerning, for example, the credibility of the inflation target or challenges that the central bank might face when conducting monetary policy.","[Stockhammar, Par] Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden; [Osterholm, Par] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Orebro University,"Stockhammar, P (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",par.stockhammar@konj.se; par.osterholm@oru.se,"Österholm, Pär/ABD-8486-2020","Österholm, Pär/0000-0002-4840-7649",,,,,39,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

This paper uses this kind of implied volatility index of oil prices to investigate the impacts of oil price uncertainty on the aggregate and sectoral stock returns in China. This issue is resolved by using a quantile regression, which can provide a more detailed examination under different market conditions. Meanwhile, the asymmetric effects of uncertainty shocks are also examined by using the positive and negative changes of the OVX. Furthermore, we assess whether the reform of March 27, 2013 affected the OVX-stock nexus since this reform was a major step to relax the control of domestic oil prices in China. Our results reveal that OVX changes mainly show significantly negative effects on the aggregate and sectoral stock returns in the bearish market. In particular, these effects depend largely on the positive shocks of the OVX rather than the negative shocks of the OVX. Moreover, the reform of March 27, 2013 decreased the impacts of the positive OVX shocks on Chinese stock returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lower growth rates characterizing the post Global Financial Crisis era and the concerns about income inequality put to the fore the degree that better targeted investment in human capital may ameliorate the challenges facing the working poor. Using cross-country data, we find the association between the income shares of the working poor, dependence on manufacturing sector, and the availability of vocational education. Conditioning on tertiary educational attainment, improved access to better vocational education will probably contribute more than large increase in regular college attainment. Comparing the US to Germany suggests that pushing more students to BA granting colleges may no longer be the most efficient way to deal with the challenges caused by the decline in manufacturing employment affecting in particular lower-income households. We also note that a tracking of technical training and educational budget, shown in the case of Vietnam in comparison to Thailand, as well as government subsidies for reskilling of labour fource throughout their career in Singapore, is a potential explanation for their relative manufacturing competitiveness.","[Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Jinjarak, Yothin; Ngo, Nam; Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Victoria University Wellington,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.;Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",aizenman@usc.edu,"Jinjarak, Yothin/F-2746-2010","Jinjarak, Yothin/0000-0001-5262-3718; Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,30,8,9,4,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Exogenous variation in party representation is generated by the assassination of the leader of the Congress party, which occurred midway through India's national elections in 1991, and dramatically increased the probability of Congress victory for a subset of constituencies. Representation by the Congress party leads to a substantial increase in the provision of public goods favored by the poor, consistent with the party's expressed populist agenda. Among the salient changes are increases in the availability of drinking water and primary education, and declines in agricultural and industrial electrification and telephone coverage. I compare these effects to those obtained using a regression discontinuity design, and find that the latter yields little effect of Congress representation on public goods allocations.

We find that although strengthening patent protection and raising R&D subsidies have the same macroeconomic effects of stimulating innovation and economic growth, they have drastically different microeconomic implications on income inequality. Specifically, strengthening patent protection increases income inequality whereas raising R&D subsidies decreases (increases) it if the quality step size is sufficiently small (large). An empirically realistic quality step size is smaller than the threshold, implying a negative effect of R&D subsidies on income inequality. We also calibrate the model to provide a quantitative analysis and find that strengthening patent protection causes a moderate increase in income inequality and a negligible increase in consumption inequality whereas raising R&D subsidies causes a relatively large decrease in both income inequality and consumption inequality.

While empirical research in most fields has expanded in corresponding ways, the infant health production research has become an important part of the broader and inherently multidisciplinary literature on intergenerational health. The strongest and most robust findings are that policies matter for infant health, particularly those affecting access to health care, and that prenatal smoking and other chemical exposures substantially compromise infant health. Promising directions for future research include elucidating relevant pathways, reconciling the largely inconsistent estimated effects of nutrition and education, and exploring the roles of preconceptional and lifetime health care, paternal factors, social support, housing, complementarity and substitutability of inputs, factors that modify effects of inputs, and evolving medical technologies.","[Corman, Hope] Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Corman, Hope; Dave, Dhaval] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA USA; [Reichman, Nancy E.] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Rider University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Bentley University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences,"Corman, H (通讯作者)，Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.;Corman, H (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",corman@rider.edu; ddave@bentley.edu; reichmne@rwjms.rutgers.edu,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its support of the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University [67038, 74260]","Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its support of the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University","First and foremost, this article was a labor of love for our mentor, life coach, and friend, Michael Grossman.

It is natural to assume that stricter regulatory policies incentivize a higher adoption of such technologies. Nonetheless, it has been shown that, under perfect competition, this is not always true. Methodology: This article offers a theoretical study of the incentives of three different environmental regulatory instruments (taxes, tradable permits and emission standards), on the adoption of a new abatement technology for a Cournot oligopoly. Results: As in perfect competition, if the marginal abatement cost curves of both technologies cross and the firms have different adoption costs, it is possible that high taxes, few tradable permits and a small emission standard (strict policies) discourage the adoption of new technologies. Conclusions: When choosing a regulatory instrument, it is important to take into account the structure of the available abatement technologies. Otherwise, instead of incentivizing the use of cleaner technologies, the regulator might do the opposite if the policies are too strict.","[Gama, Adriana] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Gama, A (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",agama@colmex.mx,"Gama, Adriana/W-4989-2019",,,,,,30,1,1,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We use the model to quantify the importance of exogenous productivity differences and the size-dependent distortions emphasized in the misallocation literature. Our findings indicate that such distortions are critical to generate the observed differences in the growth of relative managerial earnings across countries. Distortions that halve the growth of relative managerial earnings, a move from the U.S. to Italy in our data, lead to a reduction in managerial quality of 27% and to a reduction in output of about nearly 7% - more than half of the observed gap between the U.S. and Italy. Cross-country variation in distortions accounts for about 42% of the cross-country variation in output per worker gap with the U.S. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A seller and potential buyers start out symmetrically uninformed about the quality of a good, but the seller becomes informed after the game begins. We show that this developing adverse selection gives rise to novel trading dynamics. In particular, if the seller's learning speed is high, the equilibrium features collapse-and-recovery behavior: Both the equilibrium price and the trade probability first drop and then increase over time. While the trade surplus monotonically decreases as the learning speed increases, the seller's surplus may change non-monotonically. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since much of the corruption literature is plagued either by the lack of instruments or weak instruments, this paper makes a methodological contribution by drawing inferences based on Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio approach. We provide robust evidence that women's presence in parliament has a causal and negative impact on corruption while other measures of female participation in economic activities are shown to have no effect. Further, this negative relationship between women's presence in government and corruption is also found to hold in a regional analysis of 17 European countries alleviating concerns that the relationship is driven by unobservable country-fixed characteristics. Finally, we show that this relationship does not disappear when women gain similarity in social status. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain a set of new partial identification results for both the average treatment response and the average treatment effect. In particular, we find that the monotone treatment response and monotone treatment selection bound of Manski and Pepper, 2000 can be further tightened if we impose the smoothness conditions on the treatment response. Since it is unknown in practice whether the imposed smoothness restriction is met, it is desirable to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the smoothness assumption. We demonstrate how one can carry out a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect by varying the degrees of smoothness assumption. We illustrate our findings by reanalyzing the return to schooling example of Manski and Pepper, 2000 and also by measuring the effect of the length of job training on the labor market outcomes.","[Kim, Wooyoung] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kwon, Koohyun; Kwon, Soonwoo] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, Inst Fiscal Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Yale University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Kim, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wkim68@wisc.edu; koohyun.kwon@yale.edu; soonwoo.kwon@yale.edu; sl3841@columbia.edu,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733",European Research Council [ERC-2014-CoG-646917-ROMIA]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01014041]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01014041],"European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We would like to thank the Editor, Rosa Matzkin, three anonymous referees, Steve Bond, Andrew Chesher, Toru Kitagawa, Charles Manski, Adam Rosen, Kyungchul Song, and Elie Tamer for helpful comments.

We instruct subjects that the rule is to take the costly action. Their willingness to incur such a cost reveals respect for norms. We show that choices in this task are similar across five countries.

A surprising and yet key feature of these large and apparently liquid markets is that they seem to be bound up with the widespread use of mathematical valuation and risk management models by market participants. The paper investigates derivative models and risk management by highlighting the grounds for their emergence, their establishment and their influence on market developments. A political economy of derivatives markets provides insights into the essential nature of derivatives, defining them against the material circumstances in which they arise, and allows the logical development of valuation models and risk management as the necessary complement to the large-scale derivatives markets that have developed since the 1980s. The paper builds from finding prices for potential new trades to valuing completed trades and risk managing portfolios to show how and why valuation models and risk management are bound up with today's derivatives markets.","[Lindo, Duncan] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Lindo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",duncanlindo@yahoo.co.uk,"Lindo, Duncan/AAD-4626-2019","Lindo, Duncan/0000-0002-7847-6442",,,,,83,5,5,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The case of Pakistan rupee,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gold; Safe haven; Exchange rate destruction; Wavelets; Quantile regression,STOCK-MARKET; OIL PRICES; HEDGE; TIME; VOLATILITY; INVESTMENT; INFLATION; CAUSALITY; COMOVEMENT; GROWTH,"Investors often look for a refuge to avoid undesirable exposures to risk during period of extreme downturns in currency returns. We investigate daily gold and rupee exchange rates depreciation against set of currencies over the period of 1992-2015. Using wavelets at multiple time horizons; we find that gold act as a consistent short run hedge against exchange rate hence validating the exchange rate destruction hypothesis. This finding is helpful for speculators in their decision making while taking long and short positions accordingly. This finding suggests that central bank also need to keep other safe haven assets in reserves because the hedging ability of gold is only limited to short run. Further, the role of gold in providing protection against currency risks is also confirmed using quantile regression. These results assist portfolio managers and governments in formulating effectual diversification strategy for preserving investment portfolio during extreme event condition. Our results also suggest that gold has a lead relationship with exchange rate; however, this relationship switches over specific time intervals. This finding is of major concern for policy makers in determining the extent of stabilization in gold prices to bring consistency to exchange rate. Finally, the Granger coherence coefficients confirm that the strength of the causal relationship varies across over all frequencies. These conclusions have important implications for policy makers, economic analysts, portfolio managers and institutional investors. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling.

This paper argues that digital-industrial innovations make human capital more important than ever and the focus needs to shift to the complementarity between new technologies and human abilities. In particular, more effort should be devoted to (i) understanding what new skills will be needed, and how existing jobs will change; (ii) upgrading education and professional training schemes; (iii) reforming labor market institutions to support a future where a larger share of workers will change jobs and employers more frequently; (iv) reforming social benefits systems and bolstering social safety nets to smooth the economic transition and cushion the impact on the worst-affected workers. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges, addresses the key areas of action, and puts forward specific proposals, including policy actions, industry initiatives, and further research projects. The authors argue that the G20 could and should champion a comprehensive approach to leverage digital-industrial innovations for faster job creation and growth, with initiatives to re-align demand and supply of skills, labor market reforms, redesigned social safety nets, measures to promote digital innovation and facilitate the adoption of skills-augmenting technologies, and strengthened private sector training programs.","[Annunziata, Marco] Annunziata Desai Advisors, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA; [Bourgeois, Hendrik] Cargill, Wayzata, MN USA",Cargill,"Annunziata, M (通讯作者)，Annunziata Desai Advisors, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA.",annunziata.sf@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,57,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 28,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201842.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-42,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL0FB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000436639400001,0

Population size and wages are also negatively affected. The effects are sizeable and persist more than 20 years after mine closures. These results are consistent with men and women being imperfect substitutes in the labour market, and highlight the importance of considering gender issues when assessing the economic impact of natural resources.","[Aragon, Fernando M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Rud, Juan Pablo] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Toews, Gerhard] Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",Simon Fraser University; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Oxford,"Toews, G (通讯作者)，Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",faragons@sfu.ca; juan.rud@rhul.ac.uk; gerhard.toews@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Aragón, Fernando/IQR-4741-2023","Aragon, Fernando/0000-0002-9690-0817",,,,,55,28,28,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2018,52.0,,,,,,54,67,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.03.007,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL1ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000436913700005,0

LML represents the mixing distribution of a logit kernel as a sieve function (polynomials, step functions, and splines, among many other variants). In the first part of this paper, we conduct Monte-Carlo studies to analyze the number of required parameters (e.g., polynomial order) in three LML variants to recover the true population distributions, and also compare the performance (in terms of accuracy, precision, estimation time, and model fit) of LML and a mixed multinomial logit with normal heterogeneity (MMNL-N). Our results indicate that adding too many parameters in LML may not be the best strategy to retrieve underlying taste heterogeneity; in fact, over-specified models generally perform worst in terms of BIC. We recommend to use neither minimum-BIC nor the most flexible specification, but we rather suggest to start with the same number of parameters as a parametric model (such as MMNL-N) while checking changes in the derived histogram of the mixing distribution. As expected, LML was able to recover bimodal-normal, lognormal, and uniform distributions much better than the misspecified MMNL-N. Computational efficiency makes LML advantageous in the process of searching for the final specification. In the second part of the paper, we estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates of German consumers for different vehicle attributes when making alternative-fuel-car purchase choices. LML was able to capture the bimodal nature of WTP for vehicle attributes, which was not possible to retrieve using standard parametric specifications.","[Bansal, Prateek] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 305 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Achtnicht, Martin] Dresden & Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Mannheim, Germany",Cornell University; Cornell University; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bansal, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pb422@cornell.edu; daziano@cornell.edu; m.achtnicht@ioer.de,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014","Bansal, Prateek/0000-0001-6851-8461",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1462289],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Award No. CMMI-1462289.

The results demonstrate that 8 out of 20 analyzed variables determine the measurement scale of HRM practices in these organizations. These variables are related to psychological demands, active work and development possibilities, social relations and leadership, and the degree of coherence in the organization with its principles.

Our analysis uses a panel vector autoregressive model and novel measures of export-intensity adjusted final demand in China's secondary and tertiary sectors. Impulse-response analysis suggests that spillovers are largest for shocks to China's secondary sector: a one percentage point decline in demand growth from China's secondary sector reduces average partner country export growth by almost 0.3% points on impact, and about half this amount on average over the first year; the same size shock to China's tertiary sector has a much smaller effect. This suggests that spillovers to different trading partners will depend on their sectoral linkages with the Chinese economy. At the regional level, the analysis indicates that countries whose trade linkages with China are strongest-such as those in Asia-would be most affected. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

While these suggestions have strong advantages, they also potentially increase the financial costs associated with data collection and, as a result, hamper the growth of experimental economics and limit the questions that may be addressed using experimental methods. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of extra credit as a reward medium as it is financially less taxing and readily available to most researchers as an alternative. We focus on experimental asset markets because data is particularly costly to collect for these experiments, e.g., a market consisting of 8-12 traders interacting over 15 trading periods is an independent observation. Our treatment variable is the reward medium, either extra credit or cash. We compare bubble measures in the two treatments and we find that bubbles observed in the extra-credit sessions are not significantly different from bubbles observed in the cash sessions. These results suggest that extra credit is an effective reward medium in experimental asset markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model endogenises pricing decisions by firms, wage setting by unions and interest rate setting by banks on both firm and interbank lending. Banks also set leverage targets and precautionary liquidity buffers on the basis of internal risk models. Our model produces endogenous fluctuations driven by the pricing behaviour of firms and the wage setting behaviour of unions. Fluctuations lead to loan defaults which are exacerbated as lenders reduce lending and charge higher interest rates, inducing a credit crunch. We also study how making the inter-banking network more connected affects the key outcomes of the economy and find that while the flow of funds from surplus banks to firms can be increased, the latter effect is soon dominated by increasing instability in the real sector as firms default at higher rates. While the banking sector experiences fewer defaults as a whole, losses on the interbank market increase as a source of bank defaults. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The product can be seen as an experience good in the first period. How well the product fits the consumers' taste is learned only after experimentation, allowing for signaling in the second period. I find that the larger the degree of risk aversion, the higher the probability of observing an introductory price. Moreover, after the realization of a relatively poor fit between the product and the consumers' taste, an introductory price is optimal from an ex-post perspective. Finally, a first-period price ceiling leads to a strictly larger level of welfare if and only if consumers are moderately risk averse. (C) 2018 The Author.

The findings of this paper suggest that countries with better institutions and high information flows receive high capital flows, and information flows also provides a partial explanation to the Lucas Paradox. The latter result is significant even after controlling for institutional quality, financial openness and human capital differences across countries, and using instrumental variable for information flows. This paper also examines the indirect effects of institutional quality on capital flows per capita through its impact on information flows and finds that countries with better institutional quality have higher levels of information flow. Accounting this indirect effect is economically important and papers that do not account for this indirect effect of institutions on capital flows per capita would underestimate the effect of institutions on capital flows per capita. Findings of this paper suggest that relatively poorer countries should improve their institutional quality and increase their access to worldwide information and promote investments in communications infrastructure to attract long-term capital flows.

This article combines two rich firm-level data sets to analyze the effect of a dense geographical concentration of industries on the innovativeness and productivity of firms. The results show that increased concentration of employment in the same industry (localization) is associated with higher innovation output and higher productivity. At the same time, however, a higher number of firms in the same industry are associated with lower innovation output and lower productivity. These two findings are visible within a distance of 500m away from the respective firms, but then vanish for longer distances. Furthermore, the article finds no evidence that increased concentration of employment in other industries (urbanization) is positively related to higher innovation output. In contrast, increased concentration of employment in other industries is strongly related to higher productivity, whereby this effect extends to large distances of up to 10 km. The results of the article thus suggest that those agglomeration externalities operating over longer distances, such as labor market pooling, work mostly across industries, while the comparatively more local knowledge spillovers tend to work mostly within industries.","[Ruffner, Jan; Spescha, Andrin] Eidgenossi Tech Hsch Zurich KOF Konjunkturforsch, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Ruffner, J (通讯作者)，Eidgenossi Tech Hsch Zurich KOF Konjunkturforsch, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ruffner@kof.ethz.ch; spescha@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Why have Ukrainian women, at the rear of the armed conflict in Donbas, volunteered to care for wounded or sick soldiers? Their commitment to volunteering has arisen out of the encounter between everyday emotional, affective and sentimental experiences and their sociological and biographical characteristics. Thanks to a particular attention paid to practices of their profane caregiving, light is also shed on the ties created among the care-givers themselves and, too, between them and hospitalized soldiers. The affective intensity of this experience (which extends to circles of sociability, love, family life and volunteer activities) makes it hard for these women to imagine being demobilized as long as the conflict continues, despite the occupational and financial marginalization to which their commitment exposes them.","[Shukan, Ioulia] Univ Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France; [Shukan, Ioulia] Inst Sci Sociales Polit ISP, Nanterre, France",,"Shukan, I (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.;Shukan, I (通讯作者)，Inst Sci Sociales Polit ISP, Nanterre, France.",ioulia.shukan@parisnanterre.fr,,,,,,,42,1,1,1,2,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Factor-augmented vector autoregressions are estimated with three separate factors identified. They are: real, monetary and financial factors. The main conclusion is that there is no 'one size fits all' when interpreting the domestic responses to an exchange rate shock. International policies that aim to define a particular exchange rate or exchange rate regime are unlikely to be able to deal with so many idiosyncratic responses. Nor is it the case that a particular monetary policy strategy, such as inflation targeting, can immunize a domestic economy against all external shocks. International cooperation should instead encourage individual economies to seek out the menu of policies that ensure that each ones house is in order.","[Siklos, Pierre L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Siklos, Pierre L.] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.;Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",psiklos@wlu.ca,,,Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research,Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research,"I am grateful to the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research for financial support under their HIGMR seminar where an earlier version of this paper was presented, and to the Editor as well as four HKIMR working paper 2005-17.

In this article, we investigate this hypothesis using a dynamic model of political economy. As well as formalizing this argument, our model demonstrates its limits, elucidating a robust theoretical force making democracy less stable in societies with high social mobility: when the median voter expects to move up (respectively down), she would prefer to give less voice to poorer (respectively richer) social groups. Our theoretical analysis shows that in the presence of social mobility, the political preferences of an individual depend on the potentially conflicting preferences of her future selves, and that the evolution of institutions is determined through the implicit interaction between occupants of the same social niche at different points in time.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University; University of Chicago; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014; Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951","Army Research Office, ARO MURI [W911NF-12-1-0509]; Carnegie Foundation","Army Research Office, ARO MURI(MURI); Carnegie Foundation","Acemoglu gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Army Research Office, ARO MURI W911NF-12-1-0509, and the Carnegie Foundation.",,47,25,27,1,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Positive productivity gains are often attributed to productivity spillovers; however, an alternative, much less emphasized channel is selection and market reallocation., whereby competition leads to factor and revenue reallocation within and between domestic firms and exits of the least productive firms. We investigate the roles of these different mechanisms in determining aggregate-productivity gains using a unifying framework that explores the mechanisms' distinct predictions on the distributions of domestic firms: within-firm productivity improvement shifts rightward or reshapes the productivity distribution, while selection and market reallocation move the revenue and employment distributions leftward and raise left truncations. Using a rich cross-country firm-level panel dataset, we find significant evidence of both mechanisms and effects of competition in product, technology, and labor space. However, selection and market reallocation account for the majority of aggregate-productivity gains, suggesting ignoring this channel could lead to substantial bias in understanding-the nature of productivity gains from multinational production.","[Alfaro, Laura] Harvard Sch Business, Morgan 461, Boston, MA 02445 USA; [Alfaro, Laura] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chen, Maggie X.] George Washington Univ, 2115 G St 367 NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; George Washington University,"Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Morgan 461, Boston, MA 02445 USA.;Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lalfaro@hbs.edu; xchen@gwu.edu,,,World Bank Structural Transformation and Economic Growth project,World Bank Structural Transformation and Economic Growth project,"We are very grateful to four anonymous referees for insightful comments and suggestions.

Results show this to be the case: lower ability participants receive lower payoffs and are over-represented at the worst school. Under the strategy-proof Deferred Acceptance mechanism, payoff differences are reduced, and ability distributions across schools harmonized. Hence, we find support for the argument that a strategy-proof mechanism levels the playing field.

This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness of the economy and its borrowing terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country's borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of commodity price increases on GDP, consumption, and investment, and a negative effect on the total trade balance. Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a large volatility of investment. Besides explicitly incorporating a double role of commodity prices, the model structure nests the various candidate sources of shocks proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in post-1950 output growth is in the order of 38%. In addition, commodity prices account for around 42% and 61% of the variation in consumption and investment growth, respectively.

This article presents, specifies and develops the model's underlying macroeconomic theory. The Rehn-Meidner theory is a synthesis between a flex-price Kaldorian model of profit margins and a Kaleckian model where profit margins are squeezed under full-employment conditions. The theory deviates from both the Kaldorian and Kaleckian models by stressing the importance of low profit margins for productivity growth. Moreover, in the Rehn-Meidner program, full employment is guaranteed irrespective of the level of aggregate demand. The Rehn-Meidner theory and policy deserve a prominent place in macroeconomics even in the age of globalization and financialization. However, some weaknesses of the model make it necessary to modify the arguments for and partly the composition of its policy program.","[Erixon, Lennart] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Erixon, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",lex@ne.su.se,,,,,,,79,9,9,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

An often proposed solution to motivating employees in multidimensional environments is for organizations to use incentive compensation. Incentive compensation can both direct employees' attention (attention-directing property) and motivate their effort levels (effort-inducing property) but incentive compensation might not always be optimal in multi-dimensional settings. Thus, it is important to better understand the two proposed properties of incentive compensation through which incentive compensation motivates employee performance. Conducting an experiment in a multidimensional environment that contains quantity and quality task dimensions, we find that the incremental effectiveness of the effort-inducing property over the attention-directing property on performance quantity and performance quality varies depending on the task dimension toward which attention is directed and effort is induced. Specifically, the effort-inducing property has a positive incremental effect over the attention-directing property on performance quality when the quality dimension is incentivized; however, the effort-inducing property does not have a positive incremental effect over the attention-directing property on performance quantity when the quantity dimension is incentivized. This study provides important insight regarding the properties of incentive compensation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is well known that fictitious play fails to be Hannan consistent. Several variants of fictitious play including regret matching, generalized regret matching and smooth fictitious play, are known to be Hannan consistent. In this note, we consider sampled fictitious play: at each round, the player samples past times and plays the best response to previous moves of other players at the sampled time points. We show that sampled fictitious play, using Bernoulli sampling, is Hannan consistent.

Under what we term a sound finance rule' the interest rate targets output while the fiscal balance targets public debt; under a functional finance rule' the budget balance targets the output gap and the interest rate targets the debt ratio. The same unique combination of interest rate and fiscal balance will be consistent with output at potential and a constant debt-GDP ratio regardless of which instrument is assigned to which target. The stability characteristics of the two rules differ, however. At low levels of debt, both rules converge to the targets, but there is a threshold debt level above which only the functional finance rule converges. Contrary to conventional wisdom, therefore, the case for countercyclical fiscal policy becomes stronger, not weaker, when the ratio of public debt to GDP is already high.

Price competition is more intense, and the symmetric equilibrium price is lower when returns are costlier. As a result, consumer surplus is increasing in the return cost. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical analysis is based on a state space model with time-varying coefficients, which is employed on a dataset from 11 New EU Member States. It is shown that the impact of consumer confidence (reflecting the overall uncertainty level in the country) skyrockets in the 2008 Great Recession, providing evidence that the recent crisis was to some extent psychologically governed. After that, the influence of consumer confidence on GDP mostly stabilizes at earlier levels. The EU accession seems not to play an important role in the observed relationship. The obtained conclusions are quite robust across countries and remain intact upon the inclusion of additional control variables in the model. A possible solution for keeping the psychological determinants of the crisis under control is a prompt, coherent, and clearly communicated crisis management policy, which might help preventing a momentous drop of consumer confidence and overall uncertainty.","[Soric, Petar] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Soric, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",psoric@efzg.hr,"Soric, Petar/AAB-9026-2019","Soric, Petar/0000-0002-6773-264X",Croatian Science Foundation [3858],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project No. 3858.,,30,19,19,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,45.0,2,,,,,261,282,,10.1007/s10663-016-9360-4,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD0FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000430176500003,0

Income polarization can be closely linked to social exclusion, which is relevant for EU social policy, because combatting social exclusion is a central element of the Lisbon Agenda and the Europe 2020 Strategy. Rising income polarization has been observed outside Europe, but within the EU, polarization is relatively unexplored. This paper provides theoretical insights into this relatively new dimension of income distribution and analyzes trends in income polarization in 28 EU countries and 3 non-EU countries, using micro-data from EU-SILC over the period 2004-2012. Income polarization is rather stable over this period in European countries, and Europe-wide. It was rising among the old EU15 countries in the sub-period 2004-2008, but declining afterwards. The opposite development is witnessed for New Member States. Despite the Great Recession we find quite stable income polarization in Europe.","[Wang, Jinxian; Caminada, Koen; Goudswaard, Kees] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,Chinese Scholarship Council; Natural Science Foundation of China [71703088]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M591645]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC045],Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"Leiden University, Leiden University, Leiden University, and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, respectively.

The Chinese Government is very powerful, and fiscal policy plays an important role in China's economy. A dynamic Nelson-Siegel model is adopted to estimate the level, slope and curvature factors of the yield curve. Three aspects of fiscal behaviour, including government spending, revenue and budget balance, are considered. Significant relationships between fiscal behaviour and the sovereign yield curve are found and described in the present study. Higher government expenditure raises the level and slope factors of the yield curve, while increasing government revenue reduces the level factor and enhances the slope factor. Furthermore, improved budget balance decreases the level and slope factors of the yield curve. Fiscal behaviour also interacts with the macroeconomy in China. Fiscal policy is insensitive to price surges in contrast to the strong responses of monetary policy to higher inflation. In addition, crowding-out effects of government spending are demonstrated in this study.","[Yan, Yifeng; Guo, Ju'e] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Yan, YF (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",yanyifeng0123@163.com,,,,,,,34,5,5,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In this setting, more productive firms respond less to shocks affecting their marginal costs than less productive firms. As a consequence, economies with a larger proportion of highly productive firms face a flatter Phillips curve. Moreover, when these two features concur, the Ramsey problem gives rise to an optimal non-zero long run inflation that amplifies the differences in relative prices between more efficient and less efficient firms, thus increasing the market share of the former. Nevertheless, in the presence of transitory technology shocks, optimal short term deviations from this positive long run inflation are negligible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When global banks have higher/lower market power in one economy than the others, they don't shift funds across countries by as much in response to shocks, and the economies become more stable with robust lending. The reason is that increasing (decreasing) loans causes a sharper decrease (increase) in global banks' returns in the economy where they have high market power. It is at moderate levels of market power at which global banks (unlike domestic banks that only lend locally) substantially reallocate funds across countries and generate high volatility. This finding, unlike the usual unidirectional relationships in the literature, implies that countries should either allow few large global banks to dominate their credit markets or minimize their exposure to global banking.

On the one hand there is evidence of dynamic structural change including offshoring/globalization and technological advances that are resulting in the loss of middle-skill (routine) employment. Other studies emphasize a less dynamic economy with slower growth, reduced labor market fluidity, a decline in startup activity, and even economic stagnation. This study exploits variation among U.S. states to assess the degree that stagnation and/or important structural changes in the economy contribute to the recent phenomenon of jobless recoveries. We find support for both the stagnation and structural change theories of jobless recoveries. On the stagnation side, we find evidence that lower startup rates are a significant predictor of jobless recoveries. We also find evidence that links dynamic structural change to the jobless recovery phenomenon. More specifically states experiencing a long-run downward trend in the share of routine employment are more likely to experience a jobless recovery. Our results are consistent with the polarization theory where routine-replacing technological advances permanently reduce demand for middle-skill labor, thus contributing to jobless recoveries.

We overcome several econometric issues such as the problems of unobserved heterogeneity, persistence, and endogeneity by adopting the system GMM estimator for linear dynamic panel models. We document that firm-specific characteristics drive growth in the ICT industry, contrary to the well-known Gibrat's law. In particular, we find compelling evidence that in the U.S. ICT industry, firm growth depends on firm size. Differing from most findings in the literature, however, small firms in the ICT industry do not grow faster than large firms. We find a non-linear and concave-in-size relationship between growth and size. We also find that: a) firm growth exhibits positive persistence; b) agency costs and financial leverage impede firm growth; and c) R&D investment and financial performance facilitate growth. As expected, the Great Recession (2007-2009) curbed firm growth in the ICT industry.","[Canarella, Giorgio; Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",giorgio.canarella@unlv.edu; stephen.miller@unlv.edu,"Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019","Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605",,,,,128,28,29,4,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Three main insights emerge from our analysis and are consistent with an array of stylized facts regarding committee decision making. First, majority rule is more vulnerable than super-majority rules to the disproportionate influence of impatient committee members. Second, more diverse preferences, more patient members, or more unanimous decision voting rules lead to lengthier deliberation and more accurate decisions. Finally, balanced committees unanimously prefer to delegate deliberation power to a moderate chairman rather than be governed by a rule such as unanimity.","[Chan, Jimmy] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lizzeri, Alessandro] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Suen, Wing] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yariv, Leeat] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Fudan University; New York University; University of Hong Kong; California Institute of Technology,"Chan, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,"Suen, Chuen/A-1091-2010",,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [1158]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171125]; National Science Foundation [SES 0551014]; Shanghai Dongfang Xuezhe Program; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [HKU753911],Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Shanghai Dongfang Xuezhe Program; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This article is the result of a consolidation of 'Does Majority Rule Produce Hasty Decisions?' by Chan and Suen, and 'Sequential Deliberation' by Lizzeri andYariv.

Using a dynamic model of local public goods with endogenous affiliation and splitting, we show that local organizations may choose to affiliate with the national organization for faster capital accumulation. Temporary alliance occurs when a local organization strategically affiliates with the national organization only to break away after accumulating enough capital. Alliance is more likely to arise and persist when the local chapter is smaller, when the local chapter's mission is closer to the national organization's, when the national organization is more efficient in production, and when the local chapter is more patient. Moreover, regulation that requires the local chapter to be affiliated with the national organization would be welfare reducing when the local chapter is large, when the local and national missions differ substantially, and when production at the national organization is inefficient.","[Chen, Jiawei] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Sacks, Michael] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Sacks, Michael] West Virginia Univ, Ctr Free Enterprise, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Chen, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jiaweic@uci.edu; michael.sacks@mail.wvu.edu,"Chen, Jiawei/AEC-3274-2022; Sacks, Michael/JXN-1753-2024","Chen, Jiawei/0000-0001-6116-7232;",,,,,37,1,1,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This paper evaluates the keeping up with the Joneses phenomenon, examining the responsiveness of payment-to-income ratios for different debt types across the income distribution to changes in income among affluent households. The analysis provides evidence for the responsiveness of debt to rising top incomes. Middle- and upper-middle-income households take on more housing-related debt and have higher payments in places with higher top-income levels. Among lower-income households non-mortgage borrowing and debt payments decline, consistent with restrictions in the supply of credit.

Palfrey (1984) famously argued that if third candidate entry is expected after the two main candidates choose their platforms, the unique equilibrium is such that the two main candidates locate substantially far from each other. By conducting a laboratory experiment, we put this popular idea to test, for the first time. We allow entry to take place with four different probabilities and find that, indeed, the degree of polarization of the two main candidates' platforms increases as third candidate entry becomes more likely to occur, providing strong evidence in support of Palfrey (1984)'s formal results and underlying intuition.

We build a fully-fledged heterogeneous-agent model with an endogenous financial market of private credit and debt to rationalize these stylized facts. We show how financial development that promotes better credit allocations under more relaxed borrowing constraints can reduce the impact of non-financial shocks (such as TFP shocks, government spending shocks, preference shocks) on aggregate output and investment, and why this volatility-reducing effect diminishes with continuing financial liberalizations. Our simple model also sheds light on a number of other important issues, such as the Great Moderation and the simultaneously rising trends of dispersions in sales growth and stock returns for publicly traded firms.

(2018) criticise the balance-of-payments (BoP) view of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) crisis. I have no major objections to most of the single aspects of the crisis pointed out by these authors, except that they appear to underline specific sides of the EMU crisis, while missing a unifying and realistic explanation. Specific semi-automatic mechanisms differentiate a BoP crisis in a currency union from a traditional one. Unfortunately, these mechanisms give Febrero et al. the illusion that a BoP crisis in a currency union is impossible. My conclusion is that an interpretation of the eurozone's troubles as a BoP crisis provides a more consistent framework. The debate has some relevance for the policy prescriptions to solve the eurocrisis. Given the costs that all sides would incur if the currency union were to break up, austerity policies are still seen by European politicians as a tolerable price to pay to keep foreign imbalances at bay-with the sweetener of some European Central Bank (ECB) support, for as long as Berlin allows the ECB to provide it.","[Cesaratto, Sergio] Univ Siena, Econ, Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Cesaratto, S (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Econ, Siena, Italy.",,"Cesaratto, Sergio/JEF-9123-2023",,,,,,46,3,3,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Separately, however, these two frameworks deliver a limited amount of wage stickiness and thus require questionable calibrations to raise unemployment fluctuations. In this paper, we argue that the alternating offers model with one-sided asymmetric information, which combines the two frameworks, gives a more satisfactory answer to the puzzle. The results are improved along two dimensions. First, we show that this model is capable to generate large unemployment movements for a realistic calibration. Secondly, the model produces a right degree of real wage pro-cyclicality for such a calibration and therefore delivers a micro-founded explanation to real wage rigidities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A social accounting matrix (SAM) was constructed and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model was developed. The CGE model was used to simulate separate and combined effects of a 25% reduction of subsidy to three energy products: natural gas, oil, and electricity. This policy shock was applied to the model in two scenarios. In each round, the subsidy reductions were applied to each energy product separately in turn and then finally simultaneously to all energy products. In the first scenario, subsidy reductions were applied and results were compared with the baseline scenario given in the SAM. This yielded adverse effects across a range of endogenous variables. It leads to large energy price increases, as high as 255% (for electricity). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) marginally declined, by 0.28%. In scenario 2, the subsidy reduction was accompanied with cash transfers to energy users a compensation for welfare loss, the amount of transfer was equivalent to the sum of the amount of subsidy reductions. The results indicated that such transfers would reduce the adverse effects of the policy reform. The effects on GDP was reversed, it rose by 1.01%. The price effect was slightly lower, electricity price rose by 245%. Finally, sensitivity of the model results was examined by varying the elasticity of the substitution of composite energy and capital in production. Greater possibility of substitution seems to cause subsidy reform to have much larger positive (or smaller adverse) economy-wide effects. The simulation experiments suggest that subsidy reform would need to be accompanied by demand side stimulus or supply side initiatives to encourage energy conservation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The introduction of actuarial adjustments in the German public pension system serves as a source of exogenous variation to estimate discrete time transition rates into retirement for individuals of age 60-66. Responses to benefit reductions are elaborated separately for manual and non-manual workers. On average, individuals postpone retirement by 13.2 months if pension benefits are reduced by 3.6 percent for each year of early retirement. This result is in line with the previous quasi-experimental literature and suggests that people respond to the incentive of reducing the implicit tax on further periods of work. However, among men the response is about 50 percent lower for manual workers compared to non-manual workers. Surprisingly, this does not necessarily indicate that retirement incomes of manual workers deteriorate. The explanation is that disability pensions are available at age 63without benefit reductions.","[Giesecke, Matthias] RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",,"Giesecke, M (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",mattias.giesecke@rwi-essen.de,,,RGS Econ; Leibniz Association,RGS Econ; Leibniz Association,"I am grateful to John Abowd, Thomas K.

The results of our analysis show that the sectors with the greatest importance in terms of emissions are cattle and soybean production, which are also the most prominent for the region's economic development. Although 63% of Brazil's anthropogenic emissions of CO2eq were concentrated in the Amazon Region, under a consumer perspective the region's responsibility corresponded to only 24% of emissions in the country, being surpassed by the consumer-based emissions of rest of Brazil (49%), as well as that belonging to foreign countries by means of exports (27%).

We find that endowment heterogeneities limit the efficiency gains from these rule-based contribution schemes under random allocation. Under effort-based allocations, substantial efficiency gains relative to a VCM occur. These are largely driven by significant reductions of contributions in VCM, while the rule-based mechanisms generate stable efficiency levels, even though falling short in realizing the maximal efficiency gains.

We develop a computationally tractable stochastic version of that model wherein workers accumulate skills on the job and face a risk of skill loss after job destruction. We find that skill heterogeneity dampens the fluctuations of labor market variables, and that introducing skill loss offsets this effect and generates additional amplification. The main forces driving this result are pro-cyclical increases in the probability of skill loss during unemployment: these provide incentives to post proportionally more vacancies during upturns by raising the surplus from employing high-skill workers. Compositional changes in the unemployment pool, on the other hand, play a negligible role for empirically plausible rates of skill depreciation, which imply a relatively slow process compared to the duration of unemployment spells.

The dynamic generalized method-of-moments (GMM) results indicate that institutions play an important role in mediating the positive relationship between banking sector development and growth. This suggests that the marginal impact of financial development on growth depends on institutional quality. Using the four-way partition of institutions classified by Rodrik (2005), we also find that resilient market-regulating, market-stabilizing, and market-creating institutions act as mediators to the financial market in facilitating growth.

We test the impact of financial inclusion, along with other control variables, on poverty and income inequality. We do so for full sample of countries and then for developing Asia sample to access which factors are relevant for full sample and for developing Asia specifically. The estimation results show that per capita income, rule of law, and demographic characteristics significantly affect financial inclusion for both world and Asia samples. However, primary education completion and literacy significantly increases financial inclusion only in the full sample, not for the Asian sample. The findings also indicate that financial inclusion is significantly correlated with lower poverty and income inequality levels for the full sample. For developing Asia, however, there appears to be no link between financial inclusion and income inequality.","[Park, Cyn-Young] Asian Dev Bank, Ortigas Ctr Mandaluyong, 6 ADB Ave, Manila 1550, Philippines; [Mercado, Rogelio J.

Sourcing substitution reduced the prices paid by wholesale level buyers of these goods, but these price reductions were mostly not captured in the U.S. import price indexes and the U.S. GDP deflator. To find plausible values for sourcing bias we first use data on changes in sourcing patterns over 1997-2007 to predict the effect of the reported price discount from the new emerging market suppliers. Next, we compare adjusted import price indexes for products used for household consumption with consumer price indexes. In the GDP deflator for apparel imports, sourcing bias is found to average 0.6 percent per year, and for durable goods it averages 1 percent per year. During the decade of rapidly changing sourcing patterns, a tenth of the reported speedup in multifactor productivity growth of the U.S. private business sector may have come from sourcing bias in the deflators for imports.","[Reinsdorf, Marshall] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Reinsdorf, M (通讯作者)，6709 Kerns Rd, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",Marshall.Reinsdorf@cox.net,,"Reinsdorf, Marshall/0000-0002-3866-6591",,,,,31,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This joint volume-price risk causes a risk-averse WPP to sell less energy than the expected generation, which discourages the WPP from fully enjoying the benefits of participating in forward electricity markets. In order to mitigate volume-price risks from the RT market, this paper proposes a financial instrument referred to as a risk exchange (REX) that enables the WPPs to trade random net payments from uncertain prices and generation outputs, after the day-ahead market is cleared. A negotiation for the REX is modeled by a bargaining game based on a conflict of interest in determining the REX amounts. Both Nash and Rubinstein's bargaining game models are addressed to analyze the REX bargaining game. It is shown that there is a unique outcome of the game which can be achieved by using a pure strategy. Moreover, a central planner who aims to minimize the aggregated risks of the WPPs is explored. Numerical examples demonstrate that the REX is able to reduce RTM risks successfully and encourages the WPPs to sell more energy to the DAM. Since the REX is not limited by physical constraints in power systems, it can be traded by the WPPs exposed to different locational marginal prices (LMP5). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Second, given that these beliefs are non-standard (for economists), we present two models formalizing some of the key aspects (for example, the idea that there is something more than a material exchange in labor relations). Third, we study survey data for the 1990s on the beliefs of Peronist and non-Peronist voters in Argentina and Democrat and Republican voters in the US.

The results reveal the presence of mean and volatility spillovers from natural gas prices to stock prices in Qatar's emerging market, with the opposite direction being denied.

While the academic literature has identified several factors behind the growth in unfunded state and local public pension liabilities, there is mixed evidence on how the composition of a pension system's board of trustees affects a pension's financial health. This article contributes to this literature by measuring how public pension board composition affects fund financial health as measured by state bond ratings. With a panel dataset of state pensions between 2001 and 2014 our results indicate that elected board members are consistently associated with lower bond ratings (and thus higher borrowing costs) while appointed and ex-officio board members are associated with higher bond ratings.

We explore the extent to which these empirical regularities can be explained by a calibrated micro-founded, nonlinear growth model with normalized CES technology and endogenous labor- and capital augmenting technical change driven by purposeful directed R&D investments. We demonstrate that dynamic macroeconomic trade-offs created by arrivals of both types of new technologies can lead to prolonged swings in the labor share (and other model variables) due to oscillatory convergence to the balanced growth path as well as emergence of limit cycles via Hopf bifurcations.

This study analyzes the macroeconomic and distributional effects of these government programs. We propose a quantitative model where households endogenously choose their mortgage types either with or without government guarantees. Households that take out mortgages with government guarantees pay an up-front insurance premium, while those that choose mortgages without guarantees face borrowing limits. Our results show that a hypothetical decline in government subsidies for mortgage guarantee programs can improve aggregate household welfare, mainly due to endogenous changes in mortgage interest rates and tax burdens, rather than in housing prices. The welfare implications are different across households, depending on their financial status. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce a theoretical link from imperfect information about WCR to firms' performance. Firms choose non-prepaid factors of production with uncertainty about required prepayments, where their access to credit is constrained by collateral. After realization, firms with higher WCR may face financial constraints. This uncertainty influences their demand for inputs, albeit risk-neutrality. Unable to employ the projected level of prepaid input, constrained firms encounter capacity underutilization, leading to misallocation of factors. Aggregate productivity and output, will thus be deteriorated during credit contraction due to higher inefficiency. Empirical assessment of our findings, using the Annual Survey of Iranian Manufacturing Enterprises, shows that higher requirement for working capital tightens firms' hired prepaid inputs, production, and capacity utilization. Furthermore, firms with more uncertain working capital will choose a lower level of production. These results are especially scaled up, when firms face financial constraints.

We focus in particular on whether the model can, in general equilibrium, produce a hump-shaped lifecycle consumption profile with a peak that matches data for the average U.S. consumer. For a simple four-period model, we show that an increasing income profile along with exogenously imposed retirement are sufficient to induce a hump. With no other mechanism that can account for a hump besides bounded rationality, the model best fits the salient features of consumption data with a planning horizon of 20 years, which is well-supported by the behavioral evidence found in surveys on retirement planning. Finally, we show that the age of the consumption peak is robust to the introduction of Social Security, mortality risk, and another species of bounded rationality, quasihyperbolic discounting. Moreover, Soda! Security can be welfare improving with a short planning horizon. We can calibrate the model to jointly explain the timing of the consumption hump and the optimality of the current Social Security system. With quasihyperbolic discounting instead, we can calibrate the model so the current Social Security system is optimal but we cannot also account for the timing of the consumption hump. If we add quasihyperbolic discounting in addition to a short planning horizon, the present bias has a negligible effect in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

(2015) showed that the mate choice mechanism for a symmetric prisoner's dilemma (PD) game implements cooperation in backward elimination of weakly dominated strategies (BEWDS), and it attained almost full cooperation in their experiment. This study theoretically shows, first, that this mechanism works well in the class of quasi-dilemma (QD) games, such as asymmetric PD games and coordination games. Second, the class of BEWDS-implementable games is exactly the same as the class of QD games. Third, the mechanism cannot implement cooperation in a subgame perfect equilibrium. Finally, we confirm that the mate choice mechanism works well experimentally for an asymmetric PD game.","[Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Ctr Future Design, 2-22 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Shen, Junyi] Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Shen, Junyi] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China",Kochi University Technology; Kobe University; Shanghai University,"Shen, JY (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Res Inst Econ & Business Adm, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.;Shen, JY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",shen@rieb.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Shen, Junyi/AFS-9019-2022; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012","Shen, Junyi/0000-0001-5859-1382;",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03353] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,21,2,2,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

To date, scale efficiency measurements have only been suggested for the entire production process. For multi-output producers, more detailed results are required. Hence, in this paper, we show how to provide such information at the output level. Attractively, our output-specific scale efficiency measurements are nonparametric in nature, they take the economic objective of the producers into account, they can be defined without observing the input prices, and they are easy to interpret and to use in practice. We apply our methodology to a sample of more than 3300 US electricity plants from 1998 to 2012, producing up to 10 types of electricity. We show that, while there is a scale improvement at the total electricity generation level, this is not the case for each of the 10 types of electricity. Also, we demonstrate that, in general, renewable electricity presents better scale of production than non-renewable electricity. Finally, we highlight the importance of multi-output plants in the US electricity sector, and show that this type of plant is preferable for the production of non-renewable electricity, while single-output plants are preferable for renewable electricity.

We take a standard model of trade with heterogeneous firms and add heterogeneity in quality to the usual heterogeneity in productivity. Modeling trade intermediaries as increasing marginal costs but decreasing fixed costs of exporting, we find that only firms with the highest quality-adjusted productivity levels choose to export directly. Under certain parameter restrictions, the model shows that direct exporters tend to be larger and charge higher prices for their goods. In contrast to the literature, using Chinese customs data, we confirm that direct exporters do charge higher prices for their goods.","[Wang, Qianqian] Henan Univ, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Gibson, Mark J.] Washington State Univ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Henan University; Washington State University,"Wang, QQ (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Ming Lun St 41, Kaifeng 457001, Peoples R China.;Gibson, MJ (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",angelstella02@gmail.com; mjgibson@wsu.edu,"Gibson, Mark/P-9370-2019",,"School of Economics, Henan University","School of Economics, Henan University","School of Economics, Henan University",,15,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The panel data set includes the fourteen G-20 countries during the period 1991-2012. Empirical results show that the marginal effects of the macroeconomic variables (savings, terms of trade, public debt, capital account liberalization, economic growth, and trade openness) on international reserves are non-linear and vary with time, the proxies and countries, not linear and constant derived from traditional linear model. Currency devaluation policy (against the US dollar) can non-linearly enlarge the positive contribution of trade openness and public debt on international reserves, and non-linearly reduce the negative impact of terms of trade on international reserves, as the Marshall-Lerner condition holds. Expansionary monetary policy (through the decrease in domestic interest rates) can strengthen the positive effects of public debt, trade openness, and economic growth on international reserves. The precautionary and mercantilist views of reserves holdings are partially supported.","[Wu, Po-Chin] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, 200,Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 320, Taiwan; [Lee, Chung-Chih] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Business, 200,Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 320, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, 200,Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",pochin@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,49,3,3,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2018,45.0,1,,,,,165,185,,10.1007/s10663-016-9353-3,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FT2QF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000422990400008,0

The researchers have taken month-to-month data of CPI (the indicator of inflation), imports and exports from July 2001 through June 2017. For the analysis purpose, researchers have employed error correction model to examine the short-run association amongst the variables; however, Johansen cointegration was used to investigate the long run association amongst the variables. The Granger causality approach has been applied to check the causal directionality between the pair of variables. Results of analysis exhibited that in a long run 1% increase in exports and imports cause 0.63% and 0.57% increase in the CPI (inflation) correspondingly. However, the coefficient of predictable error correlation signifies that approximately 1.18% deviance of inflation rate through the long run level of equilibrium has been adjusted every year. Whereas, the outcomes of variance decomposition analysis (VDA) demonstrated that exports employed the highest innovation influence on the CPI (inflation) amongst all three indicators in the overall arrangement of inflation. Lastly, the outcomes of Granger causality and Toda Yamamoto causality does not find evidence for the hypotheses that the monthly changes of export and import do not cause the monthly modification in inflation in case of Pakistani economy.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem; Ghauri, Saghir Pervaiz] Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Block 17, Karachi, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Daukanto Str 28, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Ahmed, RR (通讯作者)，Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Block 17, Karachi, Pakistan.",rizwanraheemahmed@gmail.com; saghir.ghauri@gmail.com; Jolita.Vveinhardt@gmail.com; Dalia.Streimikiene@lei.lt,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502",,,,,33,6,6,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

According to this hypothesis, risks taken by creditors depend largely on availability heuristic and experience of loan officers. To assess validity of this hypothesis we construct and estimate a simple VAR model. The data for this model is acquired from results of an experimental study (lasted for 70 rounds), the purpose of which is to identify behavioral patterns of participants while meeting demand for credit, specifics of subjectively weighted assessment of credit risk, based on shock approach. The results of the study allow confirming institutional memory hypothesis. After initial shock of bad debts, number of periods to recover willingness to accept risk has increased by 39%, which supports the hypothesis of availability heuristic's influence. However, with improvement of loan portfolio's quality, willingness to take risk is restoring. In addition, we managed to confirm existence of risk's underestimation and overestimation periods in an experimental manner.","[Burakov, Dmitry] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Financial Markets & Banks, Moscow, Russia",Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation,"Burakov, D (通讯作者)，Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Financial Markets & Banks, Moscow, Russia.",dbur89@yandex.ru,"Burakov, Dmitry/S-6488-2019","Burakov, Dmitry/0000-0003-3019-5200",,,,,20,2,2,0,0,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,4,,,,,441,458,,10.2298/PAN160105003B,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GV3EI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000445976700005,0

The analysis is based on a large representative and cross-country comparative sample of manufacturing firms across seven European countries. The novelty of this work lies in the three aspects. First, we expand the results on the R&D-export and R&D-investment relationships to a wide sample of cross-European firms. This differentiates from previous works based on single-country samples. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in years which assess empirically the relationship between R&D and tangible investment at the micro level. Third, we control for endogeneity of R&D and simultaneity in firms' decision whether to export and carry out tangible investment. The results of the analysis suggest that R&D positively affects export propensity and tangible investment. The results also reveal that neglecting endogeneity and simultaneity issues leads to underestimate the effect of R&D to both export and investment propensities.","[Carboni, Oliviero A.; Medda, Giuseppe] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSEA, Sassari, Italy; [Carboni, Oliviero A.] CRENoS, Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Medda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSEA, Sassari, Italy.",gimedda@uniss.it,"Medda, Giuseppe/AAG-4393-2019",,,,,,47,21,22,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main insight is that in general it is optimal to diversify the composition of the teams, ruling out positive assortative matching. This diversification leads to negative assortative matching when teams consist of pairs of experts. And when experts' signals are conditionally independent, all teams have similar precision. We also show that if we allow experts to join multiple teams, then it is optimal to allocate them equally across all teams. Finally, we analyze how to endogenize the size of the teams, and we extend the model by introducing heterogeneous firms in which the teams operate.","[Chade, Hector] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Eeckhout, Jan] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Eeckhout, Jan] UPF, ICREA, GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of London; University College London; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA,"Chade, H (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",hector.chade@asu.edu; j.eeckhout@ucl.ac.uk,"Eeckhout, Jan/A-3981-2008",,ERC [208068]; [MINECO-ECO2012-36200]; European Research Council (ERC) [208068] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to three anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Using data from Renrendai, one of the largest P2P lending platforms in China, we investigate how the amount of punctuation used in loan descriptions influences the funding probability, borrowing rate, and default. The empirical evidence shows that the amount of punctuation is negatively associated with the funding probability and borrowing rate. We propose that the usage of punctuation affects the readability of a loan description and reflects borrowers' self-control and cognitive ability. Within a given number of words, excessive usage of punctuation makes loan description informal and reduces the readability of the text, thereby impairing investors' trust in borrowers. Moreover, borrowers that overuse punctuation may have lower ability of self-control, and tend to underestimate the risk of borrowing and offer lower borrowing rate due to overconfidence.","[Chen, Xiao] Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bihong] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Ye, Dezhu] Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Ye, DZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Dept Finance, 601 Huangpu Ave West, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chenxiao427@163.com; bihuang@adbi.org; gzydz@126.com,,"chen, xiao/0000-0001-8308-8973; Huang, Bihong/0000-0001-6492-9845; Ye, Dezhu/0009-0007-3128-149X",,,,,45,57,59,7,68,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Choosing the right moment for it is usually a differentiating factor in terms of competition, since it is a source of competitive advantage. There are several mechanisms and strategies to address this problem from the market perspective. However, the criteria of the different actors involved managers, sales representatives, experts, etc. - coexist in the corporate sphere and they often differ, causing difficulties in priority setting processes in the launch of a product or service. The assessment of the prioritization of these criteria is usually expressed in natural language, thus adding a great deal of uncertainty. Fuzzy linguistic models have proved to be an efficient tool for managing the intrinsic uncertainty of this type of information. This paper presents a linguistic multi-criteria decision-making model, able to reconcile the different requirements and viewpoints existing in the corporate sector when planning the launch of new products and services. The proposed model is based on the fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic model, aimed at managing linguistic data expressing different corporate criteria, without compromising accuracy in the calculation of said data. In order to illustrate this, a practical case study is presented, in which the model is applied for scheduling the launch prioritization of several new products and services by a telecommunications company, within the deadlines set in its strategic planning.","[Cid-Lopez, Andres; Hornos, Miguel J.] Univ Granada, Dept Software Engn, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Carrasco-Gonzalez, Ramon A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Herrera-Viedma, Enrique, I] Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Herrera-Viedma, Enrique, I] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",University of Granada; Complutense University of Madrid; University of Granada; King Abdulaziz University,"Herrera-Viedma, EI (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, E-18071 Granada, Spain.;Herrera-Viedma, EI (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",viedma@decsai.ugr.es,"HERRERA-VIEDMA, ENRIQUE/C-2704-2008; López, Andrés Cid/AAB-6454-2019; Hornos, Miguel J./D-5559-2012; CARRASCO, RAMON ALBERTO/D-9973-2012","HERRERA-VIEDMA, ENRIQUE/0000-0002-7922-4984; López, Andrés Cid/0000-0001-5470-8213; Hornos, Miguel J./0000-0001-5722-9816; CARRASCO, RAMON ALBERTO/0000-0001-7365-349X","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [TIN2016-75850-R, TIN2016-79484-R, TIN2013-40658-P]",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the Research Projects TIN2016-75850-R, TIN2016-79484-R and TIN2013-40658-P.",,84,5,5,2,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The goal of this paper is to disentangle the supply- and demand-driven sources of this home market advantage. While trade costs, foreign production costs, and taste heterogeneity all matter for market outcomes, we find that a preference for home brands is the single most important driver of home market advantage even after controlling for brand histories and dealer networks. Furthermore, we also find that consumers favor domestically producing brands even if these brands originated from a foreign country. Therefore, our results suggest a novel demand effect of FDI: Establishing local production increases demand for the brand even in the absence of any cost savings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We extend a model from Buffa, Vayanos and Woolley (2014) by allowing general contracts, and by allowing the portfolio manager to invest privately in individual risky assets or the index. To alleviate the effect of moral hazard, Agent is optimally compensated by benchmarking to the index, which, however, may incentivize him to be too much of a closet indexer. To counter those incentives, the optimal contract rewards Agent for taking specific risk of individual assets in excess of the systematic risk of the index, by rewarding the deviation between the portfolio return and the return of an index portfolio, and the deviation's quadratic variation.

We develop a model that endogenizes these differences and examines their economic consequences. A crucial determinant of differences in overconfidence is the degree of expected stability of the environment, with greater changefulness giving rise to more overconfident beliefs. When stability is endogenized, multiple equilibria can emerge, dynamism and overconfidence reinforcing each other in one case, stability and realistic self-assessment in another. Evidence from 38 countries is consistent with this relationship. Our model also sheds light on differences in overconfidence across individuals. We conduct a large-scale survey in China and find evidence consistent with the model's cross-sectional implications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However firms in emerging economies not only have to produce high quality, cost-competitive goods, but also win the resistance of consumers in the world market, who are often adverse to purchasing products from countries that yet have to build a reputation. We argue that this country-of-origin bias significantly influences the chances of leadership change. A model that aims at capturing the endogenous dynamics of demand building and leapfrogging is proposed. We show that in sectors with high monopoly power acquiring a superior technology is not sufficient for a latecomer country to become leader, unless a significant share of consumers is aware of the quality of its products. An extension of the model to multiple sectors shows that a latecomer country remains specialized into low-value undifferentiated goods, even after overtaking the technology of the leading country.

Using autoregressive distributed lag for linear and threshold cointegration, the results suggest that China's government finance and food security have reinforced each other throughout the reform era when a structural break was allowed in the model. However, the strength of cointegration and Granger causality in the government-led food security link is stronger, hence supporting the state interventionist view that a strong state has played a dominant role in fulfilling national food security in China. China's government finance and food security changes indicate food sector reform probabilities under fiscal constraint, as regime-switching indicators have delineated the Chinese government's difficult fiscal periods and the main reforms in the food sector. In practice, this result implies that further policy reforms can be effective for China's future food security.","[Du, Jane; King, Cheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Du, Jane] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [King, Cheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Sun Yat Sen University,"Du, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.;Du, J (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",eaidj@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,32,0,0,4,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It formulates a growth model with directed technological change and focuses on the case with low elasticity of substitution between clean and dirty inputs in production. New technology is substituted for the polluting input, which results in a gradual decline in pollution along the optimal long-run growth path. In contrast to some recent work, the era of pollution and environmental policy is here not just a transitory phase in economic development. This result means that the government's continuous efforts to reconcile economic growth and the environment will always be needed. The socially optimal policy includes a perpetual subsidy to 'green' research. The tax rate of pollution is monotonously increasing, while the pollution tax payments constitute a constant share of income. These policies result in a quite modest growth drag.","[Eriksson, Clas] Malardalen Univ Coll, EST, POB 883,S-721, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden",Malardalen University,"Eriksson, C (通讯作者)，Malardalen Univ Coll, EST, POB 883,S-721, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden.",clas.eriksson@mdh.se,,,,,,,42,11,11,3,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

To answer this question, we propose a methodology to identify historical fiscal adjustment episodes for countries that both needed and wanted to adjust in order to stabilize debt to GDP. We identify 91 adjustment episodes in 49 countries during 1945-2014. We find that countries typically improved their cyclically adjusted primary balances by close to 5 percent of GDP. We also observe that countries make substantial efforts to stabilize debt, but ease their primary balances once this objective is achieved, without getting back to their initial lower debt-to-GDP ratio. Consolidations were larger when sustained over time and the initial deficit was high. Fiscal adjustments were also larger when accompanied by monetary easing and, to a lesser extent, by an improvement in credit conditions.","[Escolano, Julio] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Jaramillo, Laura] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Mulas-Granados, Carlos] Int Monetary Fund, European Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Mulas-Granados, C (通讯作者)，1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",CMulasGranados@imf.org,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

The data analysed are drawn from 42 wineries from the wine cluster of Muntenia-Oltenia, one of the most appreciated wine regions in Romania. The results show that embeddedness is positively related to innovation in cluster firms, confirming previous studies in clusters. However, the most remarkable result is that network competence will moderate the nature of the relationship, highlighting the individual ability of firms to exploit the resources offered by the cluster. These results support the conclusion that firms must be aware that being properly embedded in clusters will allow them to obtain resources not available outside the cluster. Nevertheless, this is not only a question of ubiquity, but also of management skills. This represents a challenge, since the whole firm has to be managed towards a network-oriented culture change.","[Exposito-Langa, Manuel; Tomas-Miquel, Jose-Vicente] Univ Politecn Valencia, Business Adm Dept, Valencia, Spain; [Bratucu, Gabriel; Barbulescu, Oana] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Transylvania University of Brasov,"Barbulescu, O (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania.",maexlan@doe.upv.es; jotomi@doe.upv.es; gabriel.bratucu@unitbv.ro; oana.barbulescu@unitbv.ro,"Tomás-Miquel, José-Vicente/H-5127-2015; Expósito-Langa, Manuel/H-5142-2015","Tomás-Miquel, José-Vicente/0000-0002-5053-935X;",,,,,35,2,2,1,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Quantile regression results for Los Angeles County show that on average effective property tax rates decrease by $1994 per year due to length of ownership in the 50th percentile because of California's Proposition 13 assessment cap. There is evidence of both horizontal and vertical inequity across the entire sample. Low-income households do benefit from California's assessment cap as they are typically infrequent movers but their effective tax rates decrease over time. However, the most affluent households by market value do not gain the most and there is no evidence of horizontal inequity for these homeowners. There is also no evidence of horizontal inequity for middle-income households.

Monetary policy is modelled using both a standard and a modified Taylor rule and fiscal policy is modelled as either expansionary or austere. In addition, we differentiate between open economies and monetary union members. We find evidence that the modified Taylor rule notably reduces the likelihood that the financial market crisis affects the real economy. However, if we assume that households are averse to outstanding government debt, we find that a combination of expansionary monetary policy and austerity-oriented fiscal policy does a better job of stabilising both domestic and foreign economies in regard to both output and inflation. In the case of a monetary union, we find that stabilization of output in the country where the financial shock originated is no longer as easy and, in terms of prices, there is now deflation in that country and a positive inflation rate in the other member country of the monetary union.","[Foerster, Britta] Univ Marburg, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Marburg, Germany; [Hayo, Bernd] Univ Marburg, Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg,"Förster, B (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Marburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,76,1,1,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We depart from the previous literature by assuming that the individual demand is price-sensitive and depends on the copayment rate (i.e., the part paid by each consumer). We obtain two novel results under reference pricing: first, as the copayment rate increases, so do pharmaceutical prices; second, this increase in pharmaceutical prices reduces social welfare. Whilst reference pricing does emerge as a preferable reimbursement scheme, demand elasticities and the copayment rate interact in complex ways. This leads (unexpectedly) to the possibility that a higher copayment rate (lower reimbursement rate) results in higher government expenditure.","[Goncalves, Ricardo; Rodrigues, Vasco] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Gonçalves, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",rgoncalves@porto.ucp.pt; rgoncalves@porto.ucp.pt,"Goncalves, Ricardo/B-6098-2009","Goncalves, Ricardo/0000-0002-8457-4479; Rodrigues, Vasco/0000-0001-6991-2129","Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/100296/2008, PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011, PTDC/EGE-ECO/100296/2008] Funding Source: FCT",Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Financial support from Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia (projects PTDC/EGE-ECO/100296/2008 and PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011) is gratefully acknowledged.

We study the aggregated donations in the US from 1973 to 2013 using ARIMA and ARMAX models. The significant autoregressive and moving average coefficients in our estimations suggest that aggregated donations are highly autocorrelated.

It introduces seven articles written by leading business anthropologists. Anthropology is the study of humans, past and present. The central concern of anthropologists is the application of anthropological knowledge to the solution of human problems. This introductory article briefly summarizes the history of anthropology and business studies in Japan, Korea, and China, and examines the intertwined relationship of this branch of anthropology with the history of East Asian colonialism. The author then introduces anthropology's methodology and perspective that emphasize holistic, comparative, empirical, inductive, and ethno-historically oriented mode of inquiry. Anthropology regards the economic organization not only as an entity dealing with financial issues, but also as a cultural-emitter that operates in a nexus of multiple stakeholder-agencies. To study companies and economic activities in Asia anthropologically is to explore organizationally mediated, symbol-producing practices, schemes, actions, and consequences, that interact with politico-economic forces and institutional assemblage, both locally and globally. The author argues for combining the critical ethnography of Asian business on the ground, with the macro-level analyses of economic conditions and socio-political movements.","[Hamada, Tomoko] Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Hamada, T (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",thamad@wm.edu,,,,,,,66,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Particularly unique in this region, is the shared history between Malaysia and Singapore, which was once ruled-under the British empire, has since become economic rivals for the Far East - Europe trade route. This provides a suitable context to investigate whether competition or a strategic alliance should be adopted for ports in terms of its benefit to the industry in the region as a whole. Specifically, this paper analyses the ocean freight traffic demand for the Far East-Europe route among three main transshipment ports located in Malaysia and Singapore: Port of Singapore (PSA), Port Klang (PKL), and Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP). The paper provides a scenario analysis of the 3-way interaction through a game theoretic model. The results suggest that a strategic alliance between PSA and PTP generates greater profitability to the current hub and spoke network, while PKL should not commit to any cooperative strategy with either PSA or PTP.","[Ignatius, Joshua; Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Ignatius, Joshua; Tan, Tian Siang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore, Singapore; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, Logist Inst Asia Pacific, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore, Singapore",University of Warwick; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",j.ignatius@warwick.ac.uk,"goh, mark/GQO-8860-2022; goh, mark/AAC-4268-2022; Tan, Tian Siang/AAR-1442-2020","goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Tan, Tian Siang/0000-0003-3995-1519; Dhamotharan, Lalitha/0000-0001-6367-0819",,,,,47,7,9,13,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Using an ARDL model, we propose an intertemporal dynamic analysis of uncertainty for Islamic and socially responsible stock markets. Our findings show that, first, conventional and ethical investments present high comparable levels of uncertainty for which the dynamics is time-varying. Second, uncertainty in the conventional US stock market has a significant and positive effect on the uncertainty in alternative stock markets. Thus, uncertainty characterizes conventional and ethical stock markets both in the short and long terms. In particular, while the short-term uncertainty of ethical markets might be associated with their characteristics, the long-term aspect of uncertainty for ethical funds is rather associated with the effect of the conventional stock market environment. Although these findings show mean-reversion and uncertainty spillovers from the alternative stock markets to the conventional US one, they suggest lack of safety and certainty for investments in ethic markets, which remain fragile and closely dependent on the conventional market.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Nabila] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Cheffou, Abdoukarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; IPAG Business School,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,16,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Specifically, the effects of numbers of regional bank branches on their credit businesses and profits are empirically examined. The results indicated that regional banks with more branches can increase their loans and bills discounted as well as their small and mid-sized enterprises loans and bills discounted. Thus, establishing more branches is effective in increasing the total sum of loans and bills discounted by each bank because regional banks with many branches can make contact with more customers. On the other hand, return on assets and return on equity of regional banks with more branches were found to be lower. Therefore, regarding the cost performance of regional banks, establishing too many branches and maintaining branch networks that are too large can have negative effects on regional banks.","[Kondo, Kazumine] Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Aichi Gakuin University,"Kondo, K (通讯作者)，Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Meijo, Nagoya, Aichi 4628739, Japan.",kondo@dpc.agu.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP15H03366],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP15H03366.,,27,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Within EU member countries it is commonly accepted that the design of energy and mitigation policies either at national or at European level require a detailed and integrated investigation of convergence-divergence pattern among the participating countries. In this paper, we examine the distribution dynamics of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, their intensities as well as the carbonization index in 23 European countries over a forty one year period, in particular from 1970 to 2010. For this purpose we used Quah's methodology which is based on the dynamics of cross-section distributions. The main conclusion is that for all the examined variables the hypothesis of convergence patterns for the EU sample is not valid. Moreover, regarding each examined variable different groups of polarization established. Important differences occur across EU countries according to the climate type with respect to the examined variables. Our analysis provides strong evidence supporting the fact that national and European energy and mitigation policies should be implemented according to the non-convergence paradigm. The body of evidence provided by our analysis is of great importance to energy policy makers and for issues related to climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Among the developed markets, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom significantly affect liquidity changes in Asian countries like India, China, Singapore and Japan. The results revels that on average, each Asian market receives 7% spillover from the global markets and 16% from regional markets. During the financial crisis, the average regional spillover increased to 20% and the global spillover increased to 11%. Thus, in Asia, the regional spillover is higher than the global spillover.

The Czech case clearly shows that some provisions focusing on targets of lobbying can solve the transparency in a partial way only and that those can't serve as a substitute of rules for lobbyists.","[Laboutkova, Sarka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic; [Vymetal, Petr] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Int Relat, Dept Polit Sci, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Laboutková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",sarka.laboutkova@tul.cz; petr.vymetal@vse.cz,"Vymětal, Petr/AAE-4021-2021; Laboutkova, Sarka/AAI-1256-2019","Laboutkova, Sarka/0000-0001-7108-2144","Czech Scientific Foundation [16-11210S, 16-08786S]",Czech Scientific Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This research was financially supported by the Czech Scientific Foundation: project No. 16-11210S, Corruption Opportunity Space in the Czech Republic and project No. 16-08786S Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences.",,16,0,0,0,7,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,182,190,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000485363200021,0

Although confidence 'is one of the major determinants' of investment decisions in John Maynard Keynes's theory, the fluctuations of which account for the 'essential character of the Trade Cycle,' it has been relatively little studied in economics. The purpose of this article is to draw on the headway of modern psychology, entrepreneurship, and neuroscience in order to propose an explanation of business cycles based on the cycles of confidence. Economists call this explanation a 'paradox' since the very conditions of the economic boom may set the stage for a downturn. Conversely, the fact that confidence is low may gradually induce an improvement of entrepreneurs' decisions and thus of the economic context. The basic mechanism pertains to a possible discrepancy between the two dimensions of investment: demand (short-term effects) and supply (long-term effects). Confidence seems to have a major impact on cognitive effort, on the number of data sought, the way they are analyzed, on creativity and alertness, on the type of reasoning, and the causal ascription of events.","[Laine, Michael] EDC Business Sch, OCRE Res lab, Paris, France",,"Lainé, M (通讯作者)，EDC Business Sch, OCRE Res lab, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,88,2,2,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Instead of requiring buyers to reveal their entire valuation functions directly, the auctioneer gradually gathers information by offering price vectors and requiring demand responses to each buyer. The auctioneer continues to calculate the 'provisional' profile of valuation functions in a history-dependent manner and check whether the efficient allocations with and without any single buyer for this profile are revealed in the resultant history. Once these are revealed, the auctioneer ends the procedure and determines the VCG outcome associated with the provisional profile at the ending time. With the assumptions of revealed preference activity rule and connectedness, this paper shows that the VCG outcome associated with the provisional profile at the ending time is always the same as that associated with the true profile, even though the provisional profile is generally different from the true one. Only our procedures can achieve the correct VCG outcome. We further discuss the auctioneer's discretion and buyers' privacy concern.","[Matsushima, Hitoshi] Univ Tokyo, Dept Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Matsushima, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Dept Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",Hitoshi@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI 21330043]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [KAKENHI 21,330,043]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Japanese government; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03631, 16H02009] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Japanese government(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, ( Grant / Award Number: 'KAKENHI 21330043); This paper is a substantial revision of my earlier work (Matsushima (2011)).

Capital structure is an indicator that corroborates the level of financial risk. Non-profit organisations are an essential part of the general social policy. When considering the efficiency of non-profit entities from a donor perspective, it is important to take into account the way management uses the resources of a non-profit organisation as well as efficiency of that management activity. Non-profit organisation efficiency should be considered in the context of risk. One of the most important ways to increase probability to face financial distress is too high debt to equity relation. The paper illustrates the relationship between debt and equity in 1,560 Polish non-profit entities. The model which can fix optimal capital structure for a non-profit organisation in its current environment was delivered. The proposal of the paper includes a model which helps to find the optimal level of debt for non-profit organisation environmental conditions. The novelty of the model is based on the full costs of debt financing non-profit entities in the context of donor expectations, which in the Polish social and economic environment means that costs indirectly linked with the realisation of the main aim of the social entity cannot be higher than 10% of the collected money sources. An additional point of our findings is that in comparison with the current state, Polish non-profit organisations need to improve their way of fixing capital structure.","[Michalski, Grzegorz; Cierniak-Emerych, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Blendinger, Guenter; Buleca, Jan] TUKE Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice, Slovakia; [Rozsa, Zoltan] Sch Econ Publ Adm Management Bratislava, Furdekova 16, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia; [Svidronova, Maria] Univ Mateja Bela, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Bulsara, Hemantkumar] SV Natl Inst Technol, Surat 395007, Gujarat, India",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Technical University Kosice; Matej Bel University; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology,"Michalski, G (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",grzegorz.michalski@ue.wroc.pl; guenter.blendinger@hs-heilbronn.de; zoltan.rozsa@vsemvs.sk; anna.cierniak@ue.wroc.pl; maria.murraysvidronova@umb.sk; jan.buleca@tuke.sk; hbulsara@ashd.svnit.ac.in,"Rózsa, Zoltán/GZK-6056-2022; Bulsara, Hemantkumar P/B-9166-2014; Michalski, Grzegorz/A-4771-2010; Bulsara, Hemantkumar/AAG-2958-2020; Rozsa, Zoltan/E-1043-2013; Buleca, Jan/D-8777-2016","Michalski, Grzegorz/0000-0002-8211-4057; Rozsa, Zoltan/0000-0002-5748-5702; Buleca, Jan/0000-0002-6613-2167",National Science Centre; [UMO-2015/19/B/HS4/01686]; [DEC-2015/19/B/HS4/01686],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland); ;",The presented work and results are part of a monothematic cycle realised as part of the grant titled: Determinants of capital structure in non-profit organisations.

He emphasized that real (market) analysis and financial (market) analysis should be analyzed together, not separately; and that the macro economy is inherently unstable (his financial instability hypothesis). He melded financial analysis and the real market economy to interpret cycles in economic activity. An economy in boom (euphoria, animal spirits) eventually runs out of steam, reaches a peak, and descends into recession. The recession after the Minsky-moment peak segues through several financial stages based on the financial conditions of individual firms; he termed these stages as hedge, speculative, and Ponzi finance. The fragility of the economy depends on the relative weights or importance of the economy's firms in each of the three stages.","[Miller, Richard A.] Wesleyan Univ, Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Miller, RA (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In many cases, the impact of weather on sales is not constant from one season to the next. Yet, the existing research to estimate the influence of temperature on annual sales has not analysed the relationship per season, resulting in potential washout effects and underestimated weather impacts. Drawing upon French economic sectors for empirical evidence, we break down the analysis of the relationship between weather and monthly sales by season. Our methodology provides the cumulative annual contribution of weather to sales and allows deriving the maximum potential annual impact of adverse weather. With our results, analysts and risk managers can better understand the exposure to abnormal weather and consider the potential benefits of mitigating weather risk using the weather parameters we identify to structure bespoke index-based financial instruments.","[Parnaudeau, Miia; Bertrand, Jean-Louis] ESSCA Sch Management, Finance Dept, Angers, France",ESSCA School of Management,"Bertrand, JL (通讯作者)，ESSCA Sch Management, Finance Dept, Angers, France.",jean-louis.bertrand@essca.fr,"Chabot, Miia Parnaudeau/GXF-8855-2022","Chabot, Miia Parnaudeau/0000-0001-7805-0241; BERTRAND, Jean-Louis/0000-0002-4194-0731",,,,,97,8,8,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results have showed that environmental regulations do matter for agricultural trade between both regions because in the presence of excessive zero trade observations, they act as significant fixed export costs that affect the probability of trade. More stringent environmental regulations stimulate innovative efforts in cost-saving green technologies, which increase productivity and positively affect agricultural exports. The results have favoured the revisionist Porter hypothesis (PH), according to which environmental regulations may stimulate innovative efforts, which mitigate the negative effects of higher fixed abatement costs and enhance trade competitiveness.","[Ramzy, Myriam; Zaki, Chahir] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Zaki, C (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt.",chahir.zaki@feps.edu.eg,"Zaki, Chahir/AFQ-2972-2022",,,,,,58,10,10,9,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Today it is regarded as the dominant form of macroeconomic analysis despite the fact that it proved incapable of anticipating or understanding the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009 and that it was based on well-known conceptual errors. The new macroeconomics is based on Walrasian/Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium microeconomic foundations that preclude any role for money, banks, finance or governments. Attempts to integrate these institutions into microfounded general equilibrium models where no such functions are required represents a misapplication of the Walrasian/Arrow-Debreu model and leads only to confusion. The conceptual errors that existed before the GFC continue to go unrecognised or unacknowledged and undermine the post-GFC attempts to correct what were perceived to be limitations of the theory.

Neither do military technologies assigned to government agencies diffuse at different rates than those assigned to firms. The overall technological experience of the patent assignee is found to be a positive predictor of the diffusion of military technologies.

The county belongs to one from the most affected regions with the existence of brownfields in the Czech Republic. Although lately there are a lot of programs and options to their regeneration, the problem can't be solved effectively. It is clear that the occurrence of brownfields in a certain direction can influence the development of the city or municipality, last but not least, there may be pathological phenomena which may endanger the health of the population who live near brownfields. Part of the article are secondary data from database of the Agency Czechlnvest and the company Invest MORE. The article also deals with a primary research which is focused on the perception an existence of brownfields from the point of view of the public sector in the given territory. It is obvious that this issue from the perspective of the public sector is a very current topic that is needed nowadays to deal. More developed regions have greater potential of economic growth than the less developed regions.","[Skrabal, Jaroslav] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Skrabal, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",skrabal@opf.slu.cz,"Škrabal, Jaroslav/AAA-6208-2021","Škrabal, Jaroslav/0000-0002-4685-9836","project with title Brownfields in urban and rural space: geographic, economic, historical, legal contexts and their importance for regional development (BURAN) [SGS/21/2016]","project with title Brownfields in urban and rural space: geographic, economic, historical, legal contexts and their importance for regional development (BURAN)","This paper was kindly supported by the project with title Brownfields in urban and rural space: geographic, economic, historical, legal contexts and their importance for regional development (BURAN) (SGS/21/2016).",,15,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,377,385,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000485363200041,0

The estimation results of the differential input demand show that the expansion of crop production leads to an increase in acreage (i.e. extensive margin) and a proportional rise in input usage improving yield per acre (i.e. intensive margin). The substitutable relationship between fertilizer and land supports that crop producers have an option to choose either intensive or extensive margin in response to changes in their relative prices. In addition, the estimation results of the differential output supply highlight that the composition of crop supply can be altered by changes in ex-ante crop prices. The estimation results suggest that crop producers substitute corn supply for the supply of cotton, wheat and soybeans or vice versa. Based on the estimated elasticities, the decompositions of profit-maximizing input demand are conducted, which reveals that a change in ex-ante crop prices is associated closely with resource reallocation.","[Suh, Dong Hee] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Moss, Charles B.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL USA",Korea University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Suh, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dhsuh@korea.ac.kr,"Moss, Charles B/U-5254-2017","Suh, Dong Hee/0000-0002-6154-3864",,,,,44,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We first derive two different metrics for team quality, and then use those metrics to see how they impact attendance. We find that there is a positive interaction between the quality of the teams. Then various simulations are run to see how attendance would change under different scheduling scenarios. If teams are put into conferences based on the team quality measures, the average per game attendance only rises 1-2%. This is true if 1-year or 10-year quality measures are used. However, our simulation suggests that this effect would be more than offset, mainly because schools with larger capacity would play fewer home games and so aggregate attendance would fall. We discuss whether this effect would be mitigated by capacity adjustments in the longer term.","[Szymanski, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Winfree, Jason] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Szymanski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",stefansz@umich.edu; jwinfree@uidaho.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020",,,,,,31,8,9,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Co-movements between variables are varying over time and show a complex characteristic in that they mostly occur in periods during which the macroeconomy or financial markets suffered severe shocks. Therefore, we employ wavelet analysis to detect the bilateral co-movements in both time and frequency domains based on Friedman and Ball's (1992) hypothesis. The empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty, thus highlighting that inflation precedes uncertainty in the short term and has the opposite causality in the long term. This conclusion is in accordance with the previous hypotheses of Friedman and Ball (1992) and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986), which means that higher inflation will increase the inflation uncertainty and vice versa. Therefore, the Slovak monetary authorities should stabilize the inflation uncertainty by adjusting the inflation level.","[Tao, Ran] Qingdao Municipal Ctr Dis Control & Preventat, 175 Shandong Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Zheng-Zheng; Li, Xiao-Lin; Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Sch Finance, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi-Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, 308 Ningxia Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Qingdao University,"Li, ZZ (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sch Finance, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",taotao0212@163.com; 941111242@qq.com; 941111242@qqsmileman2004@126.com; cwsu7137@gmail.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation of China [16CJY069],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 16CJY069).,,61,5,5,0,2,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

It uses a semiparametric adaptive estimator that does not require the usual Gaussian assumption of maximum likelihood (ML) estimators. The results suggest that both price competition and seller heterogeneity are key drivers of the observed price dispersion. The paper finds that sellers with large sales volume, newly established sellers and US mainland states-based sellers tend to price lower. The identified significant spatial interaction is evidence of spatial price competition. Controlling for everything else, a seller asks a lower price when large sellers charge relatively high prices, which is also evidence of price-based selling and undercutting.","[Wang, Haoying] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Management, Socorro, NM 87801 USA",New Mexico Institute of Mining Technology,"Wang, HY (通讯作者)，New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Management, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",halking.econ@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,4,4,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The focus of this article, Portfolio Management, is on one of these omitted topics. Starting from the fundamental recognition of uncertainty, we examine the whole range of characteristics of the Keynesian Approach, demonstrating the coherence and applicability of its multidimensional nature, in the process pointing, by contrast, to the one-dimensional sterility of the conventional approach. Our general conclusion is that there is a rightful place in the Keynesian canon for Portfolio Management, by which we mean not only Investment Management but also Speculative Management, where these two qualifiers are used in the Keynes-Graham sense.","[Woods, J.

The main objective of this study is to examine how drinking behavior developed over an economic boom, subsequent crisis, and an eventual recovery. We use individual longitudinal data collected through a postal survey by The Directorate of Health in Iceland in 2007, 2009, and 2012. Pooled OLS and linear probability models are used to study four outcomes: Alcohol-consumption frequency, frequency of binge drinking, binge-drinking participation and alcohol dependence. Alcohol-consumption frequency declined during the crisis, with a further decline during the recovery period. This change is driven by female behavior between 2007 and 2009, but a combined gender effect between 2009 and 2012. This effect is suppressed by male labor-market-changes, but partly mediated by labor marked changes in the case of females. Alcohol dependence declined during the crisis, with suggestive evidence of partially reverting back to previous levels during the recovery. There is some indication that during the crisis real price changes of alcohol played a role in the decline in alcohol consumption but that is not a likely determinant of changes in alcohol consumption for the 3 year period post-crisis that we explore. Men's consumption can partly be explained through income changes while women's consumption changes are rather driven by changes in work hours or other factors.","[Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey; Bjornsdottir, Asgerdur Th; Olafsdottir, Thorhildur] Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Bjornsdottir, Asgerdur Th] SAA Natl Ctr Addict Med, IS-103 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Olafsdottir, Thorhildur] Univ Iceland, Fac Business Adm, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Asgeirsdottir, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",ta@hi.is,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023","Olafsdottir, Thorhildur/0000-0003-2003-9984",University of Iceland Research Fund; Icelandic Research Fund (IRF) [130611-052],University of Iceland Research Fund; Icelandic Research Fund (IRF),We are grateful for funding from the University of Iceland Research Fund and the Icelandic Research Fund (IRF grant number 130611-052).

I show that, if the economy is only buffeted by purely temporary shocks to inflation, nominal GDP level targeting may be preferable because it requires the burden of the shocks to be shared by prices and output. However, in the presence of persistent supply and demand shocks, strict price level targeting may be superior because it induces greater policy inertia and improves the tradeoffs faced by the central bank. During lower bound episodes, somewhat paradoxically, nominal GDP level targeting leads to larger falls in nominal GDP.","[Billi, Roberto M.] Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Billi, RM (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Res Div, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",Roberto.Billi@riksbank.se,,"Billi, Roberto/0000-0002-3949-8948",,,,,30,16,18,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The probabilistic loss parameter entails losing 10, 50 or 90% of the value of the public good that is maintained through cooperation, where the likelihood of the loss decreases in total group cooperation. By design, the expected marginal net benefits to an individual and the expected harm to others depends endogenously on the individuals' expectations of group cooperation and exogenously on the magnitude of the loss parameter. We find that individual cooperation is greater when forecasts of total group cooperation are greater and where the magnitude of the probabilistic loss is larger. There is, however, an interesting asymmetry in responses by two subgroups. Subjects who are pessimistic regarding total group cooperation decrease cooperation the higher the magnitude of the probabilistic loss and their decisions are tied systematically to changes in their expectations of other's cooperation. On the other hand, subjects who are optimistic regarding total group cooperation are found to be more cooperative, but their decisions are not systematically tied to changes in expectations of others' cooperation.","[Blanco, Esther; Haller, Tobias] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall 105, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Blanco, Esther; Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, Bloomington, IN USA",University of Innsbruck; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Haller, T (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",tobias.haller@uibk.ac.at,"Blanco, Esther/K-9124-2014","Blanco, Esther/0000-0002-4887-5717",Austrian Science Fund (FWF); Austrian Science Fund [P 25973-G11]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P25973] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Open access funding provided by Austrian Science Fund (FWF).

The paper reports econometric procedures and empirical estimates for major currency-owned large economies and non-major currency-owned countries. One task, for which the elasticities of international trade and real GDP are needed, is developing exchange rate assessments. The study finds that real currency depreciation leads to improvement of trade balance in most of the examined developed countries. But the trade balances after real depreciation of currency do not follow J-curve patterns. With regard to the real exchange rate variability, the evidence is mixed. Similarly, effects of the real currency devaluation on real GDP differ across countries. Also, we observe that major currency owned countries could have different value-and-volume-effects with non-major currency countries.","[Choi, Myoung Shik] DanKook Univ, Int Trade Dept, Yongin, South Korea",Dankook University,"Choi, MS (通讯作者)，DanKook Univ, Int Trade Dept, Yongin, South Korea.",msc50355@gmail.com,"Choi, Myoung Shik/AGZ-8036-2022","Choi, Myoung Shik/0000-0001-7049-5799",,,,,34,0,0,2,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In the classical mode, participants are given the choice between receiving a certain amount of money, smaller and sooner, today and a higher amount, larger and later, delayed (e.g., (sic)55 today vs. (sic)75 in 61 days). This is referred to as the standard mode. In the penalty mode, the participant must give up an explicit amount of money in order to choose the smaller and sooner option (e.g., (sic)75 in 61 days vs. (sic)55 today with a penalty of (sic)20). This is the explicit mode. We find that estimates of individual discount rates are lower in the explicit mode than in the standard mode. This result suggests that even very simple information about the amount of money one must surrender for choosing the earlier option increases delayed consumption. The finding has relevant implications for self-control and long-term planning in intertemporal choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While not all of the affected move across borders, international migration potentially provides an adaptation mechanism to natural hazards. The aim of this article is to assess whether natural hazards induce international migration from a macro perspective. We construct a stylized theoretical gravity model of migration that includes hazards as random shocks. To estimate this model, we deploy exogenous data on geological anzd meteorological hazards from 1980 to 2010. We combine these data with the World Bank's Global Bilateral Migration Database. Overall, our results suggest little evidence that natural hazards affect medium- to long-run international migration. However, considering heterogeneity across income groups, we find that particularly middle-income countries experience significant push and pull effects on migration from natural hazards.

The index is: higher around recessions, elections, monetary policy surprises and some major events; tends to increase faster than it decreases; and is driven by both domestic and foreign factors. I use the index to assess how uncertainty affects the Australian economy. Consistent with the real options' channel of uncertainty, I find that it reduces investment and employment growth.

Economic incidence is identified by exploiting an increase of a regional earnings cap of health and long-term care insurance as a natural experiment. Based on administrative data, difference-in-differences models are estimated. I find the burden of SSC is shared equally between employers and employees. An auxiliary analysis studies employment responses to SSC at the intensive margin by a modified bunching approach that is applied to the earnings caps of health and long-term care insurance. Finding employment responses to be negligible supports crucial identifying assumptions of the main analysis.

Which rule should it adopt? We propose three criteria. First, the rule should be consistent with good economic performance over a long historical period. Second, the rule should be consistent with recent Fed policy following the Great Recession. Third, the rule should be consistent with projected Fed policy. The first criterion is normative, while the second and third criteria are pragmatic. We consider three rules that have been the focus of extensive policy discussion. The Taylor (1993) and Yellen (2015) rules are balanced in the sense that the coefficients on the inflation and output gaps are equal, while the Yellen (2012) rule is an example of an output gap tilting rule because the coefficient on the output gap is larger than the coefficient on the inflation gap. We also consider inflation gap tilting rules where the coefficient on the inflation gap is larger than the coefficient on the output gap. An inflation gap tilting version of the Yellen (2015a) rule with a time-varying equilibrium real interest rate provides the most consistency with the three criteria.

Eichengreen discusses these two episodes from a historical, Keynesian perspective, and concludes that policies that increase aggregate demand, such as larger fiscal deficits, would have promoted a much stronger and faster recovery from the Great Recession. I review these episodes from a neoclassical approach, which provides a very different perspective on why recoveries from these episodes were so slow and incomplete. I also argue that supply-side policies, rather than demand-side policies, are more likely to restore prosperity today.","[Ohanian, Lee E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ohanian, Lee E.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Stanford University,"Ohanian, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Ohanian, LE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,69,1,2,0,6,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

First, among the broader class of tradable permit systems, our focus is exclusively on cap-and-trade mechanisms, thereby excluding emission-reduction-credit or offset programmes. Second, among cap-and-trade mechanisms, we examine only those that target pollution abatement, and so we do not include applications to natural resource management, such as individual transferable quota systems used to regulate fisheries.

We formalize this mechanism in a collective decision making model in the presence of heterogeneous beliefs in which any decision other than the default option requires unanimity. We show that this consideration of political payoffs can eliminate the inefficiency caused by a unanimous consent requirement when beliefs are polarized, but could also create under experimentation when two actors hold beliefs that differ only slightly from one another. We further show that this under-experimentation can be reduced when the political payoffs become endogenous. We illustrate the empirical relevance of the mechanism in two examples with historical narratives: we focus on the decision making process of the Chinese leadership during the country's transition starting in the late 1970s, and we further apply the model to the disagreement within the leadership of the Allied Forces on the Western Front of World War II in the autumn of 1944.

However, entrepreneurship is distributed unevenly in China. Using micro data from 2008 economic census and 2005 population census, this paper explains spatial clusters of entrepreneurship for both manufacturing and services. For both sectors, entrepreneurship (measured by new private firms) tends to emerge in places with more relevant upstream and downstream firms. Moreover, Chinitz's (1961) theories are also supported for manufacturing: small upstream and downstream firms seem to be more important for manufacturing entrepreneurship. For both sectors, entrepreneurship is positively related to city size, the share of young adults and the elderly population, and foreign direct investment. More migrants are also found to promote service entrepreneurship. Our paper is the first to consider both manufacturing and service entrepreneurship in China and should be of interest to both local and national policymakers who plan to encourage entrepreneurship.","[Zheng, Liang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhong] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Central University of Finance & Economics; Renmin University of China; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Zheng, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lzheng@cufe.edu.cn; mr.zhong.zhao@googlemail.com,"Rodrìguez, Antonio/C-5413-2018","Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Special Fund for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines through the Renmin University of China [16XNL005],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Special Fund for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines through the Renmin University of China,"This paper has benefited from comments by the editor, two anonymous referees, Janet E.

Second, democracy and bureaucratic quality are effective in reducing environmental degradation in the long-run. Third, there are positive bi-directional relationships between CO2 emissions and affluence and population as shown by panel vector autoregressive and impulse response functions.

Rehypothecation improves resource allocation because it permits liquidity to flow where it is most needed. The liquidity benefits associated with rehypothecation are shown to be more important in high-inflation (high-interest rate) regimes. Regulations restricting the practice are shown to have very different consequences depending on how they are designed. Assigning collateral to segregated accounts, as prescribed in the Dodd-Frank Act, is generally welfare-reducing.

Economicmodels suggest that free-riding incentives and lower opportunity costs give the less competent a comparative advantage at entering political life. Moreover, if elites have more human capital, selecting on competence may lead to uneven representation. This article examines patterns of political selection among the universe of municipal politicians and national legislators in Sweden, using extraordinarily rich data on competence traits and social background for the entire population. We document four new facts that together characterize an inclusive meritocracy. First, politicians are on average significantly smarter and better leaders than the population they represent. Second, this positive selection is present even when conditioning on family (and hence social) background, suggesting that individual competence is key for selection. Third, the representation of social background, whether measured by parental earnings or occupational social class, is remarkably even. Fourth, there is at best a weak trade-off in selection between competence and social representation, mainly due to strong positive selection of politicians of low (parental) socioeconomic status. A broad implication of these facts is that it is possible for democracy to generate competent and socially representative leadership.","[Dal B'o, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Uppsala, Sweden; UCLS, Chicago, IL USA; Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden; IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Uppsala University; Stockholm University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Dal B'o, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Rickne, Johanna/AEY-8084-2022","Rickne, Johanna/0000-0002-3733-7606",Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council,Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"We thank the editors, Andrei Shleifer and Larry Katz, three anonymous referees, and participants in numerous seminars and conferences for their helpful comments.

In this model, newly unemployed individuals search hard since consumption is below their reference point. Over time, though, they get used to lower income and thus reduce their search effort. In anticipation of a benefit cut, their search effort rises again, then declines once they get accustomed to the lower postcut benefit level. The model fits the typical pattern of exit from unemployment, even with no unobserved heterogeneity. To distinguish between this and other models, we use a unique reform in the unemployment insurance (UI) benefit path. In 2005, Hungary switched from a single-step UI system to a two-step system, with overall generosity unchanged. The system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and especially following, benefit cuts in ways the standard model has a hard time explaining. We estimate a model with optimal consumption, endogenous search effort, and unobserved heterogeneity. The reference-dependent model fits the hazard rates substantially better than plausible versions of the standard model, including habit formation. Our estimates indicate a slow-adjusting reference point and substantial impatience, likely reflecting present-bias.","[DellaVigna, Stefano] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; UCL, London, England; CERS HAS, Budapest, Hungary; IFS, Linkoping, Sweden; IZA, Bonn, Germany; Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; CESIfo, Munich, Germany",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; University College London; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; IFS; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Central European University; Boston University; Ifo Institut,"DellaVigna, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Reizer, Balazs/0000-0002-1567-6877","Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Alfred P.

We estimate an econometric model of retail choice to measure two sources of inertia: search frictions/inattention and a brand advantage that consumers afford the incumbent. We find that households rarely search for alternative retailers, and when they do search, households attach a brand advantage to the incumbent.

This ability is intrinsic to game theory, and is a central component of Theory of Mind, perhaps the capstone of social cognition. This component of theory of mind allows individuals to learn more rapidly in strategic environments with an element of novelty. We show that the capacity to attribute preferences yields an advantage over less sophisticated approaches to strategic interaction (e.g. reinforcement learning) because it allows agents to extrapolate to novel circumstances information about counterparts' preferences that was learned previously. We report experiments investigating this capacity in extensive form games. We find significant learning of others' preferences, providing evidence for the presence and effectiveness of this aspect of theory of mind. Moreover, scores on survey measures of autism-spectrum tendencies are significant determinants of individual learning, so our notion of theory of mind is related to the notion as understood in psychology.

In the basic model, we show that strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) protection induces a large technology transfer and narrows the North-South wage gap. However, we obtain an ambiguous result regarding the effect on economic growth, which depends crucially on the size of the transfer cost. Although strengthening IPR protection induces a high growth rate when the transfer cost is small, it can induce a low growth rate when the transfer cost is large. In the extended model, in order to examine what factors determine the transfer cost, we consider the situation where the Southern firms may misbehave and the Northern firms incur a cost to monitor them. We show that the degree of investor protection and the degree of morality in developing countries influence the size of the transfer cost, which affects economic growth.","[Ohki, Kazuyoshi] Kanazawa Univ, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan",Kanazawa University,"Ohki, K (通讯作者)，Kanazawa Univ, Inst Human & Social Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",kazuyoshi.ohki@gmail.com,,"Ohki, Kazuyoshi/0000-0002-1294-0468",,,,,27,2,2,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

First, we argue that the crucial measure that immediately ended deflationary expectations and enabled a swift recovery was a strong and involuntary devaluation of the currency, not the adoption of a new monetary policy framework. Second, starting from the recent literature on monetary policy at the zero-lower bound, we conclude that Sweden's exchange rate policy is more relevant for the current discussion than its tentative experience with price-level targeting.","[Rathke, Alexander] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; CESifo, Munich, Germany; Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut; University of Zurich,"Rathke, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rathke@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,55,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Therefore the paper focuses on a new budget design as well as alternative revenue sources. One of the possible candidates is a financial transaction tax (FTT). To research FTT revenue potential, a model based on a remittance system was designed. We analyse full or partial replacement of VAT- and GNI-based own resources by the transfer of tax revenues from a FTT raised on the national level to the EU budget. The research reveals that FTT-based own resource would be able to fully replace GNI-based own resource only for some EU member states; however, VAT-based own resource can be fully replaced by a FTT-based own resource for the entire EU. Further, results also show that from the EU11 (28) perspective, the tax is sufficient to fully replace VAT- or GNI-contributions if levied on the EU11 (28) level (not on the national level) as a direct payment to the EU budget without tracking the source member State.","[Solilova, Veronika; Nerudova, Danuse; Dobranschi, Marian] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Solilová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ritve@email.cz,"Dobranschi, Marian/V-6136-2018; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012; Solilova, Veronika/U-1720-2017","Dobranschi, Marian/0000-0002-5642-0341; Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107; Solilova, Veronika/0000-0002-9122-539X",,,,,49,2,2,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2017,44.0,4,,,,,687,731,,10.1007/s10663-017-9391-5,0.0,,,45,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,FL4DG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000414176600005,0

Two stages are considered: flight and network efficiency. Efficiency estimates are computed using multivariate copulas to control for time (trend) and individual (DMU) effects. A robust regression approach is subsequently developed to address the impact of contextual variables on efficiency levels. Results suggest that more progress has been made over the course of the years in terms of controlling flight delays that in terms of reducing CO2 emissions. These results call for specific policies that can target the latter issue more properly: authorities should pay a closer look on airlines listed in the stock market and that operate international flights to apprehend best practices and design regulatory marks to the sector. This paper also lends a distinctive contribution to the literature by modeling the first time the trade-off between flight delays and CO2 emissions in airline efficiency problems.

However, critical theoretical assumptions rest on latent respondent beliefs, such as the belief that respondents view surveys as potentially influencing policy (i.e., policy consequentiality), which gives rise to pressing empirical challenges. In this study, we develop a Hybrid Mixed Logit model capable of integrating multiple latent beliefs, and subjective measures of these beliefs, into a discrete choice model of stated preferences. Planned use of a resource, which can also be considered a latent variable, is frequently an important consideration when modelling stated preferences for a change in a good, and we demonstrate how our framework can be used to incorporate this information simultaneously. We further explore whether simple information treatments, which vary the degree to which the potential role of surveys in informing policy is emphasized, can influence respondent beliefs. Our results suggest that latent beliefs over consequentiality, resource use and, to a much lesser extent, the information treatments significantly influence elicited willingness to pay.

Further, estimates indicate that the NBP's benefits easily exceed its costs and that NOx reductions have substantial benefits.","[Deschenes, Olivier] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Deschenes, Olivier] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Deschenes, Olivier; Greenstone, Michael; Shapiro, Joseph S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Greenstone, Michael] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Shapiro, Joseph S.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, 37 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; IZA Institute Labor Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Yale University,"Deschênes, O (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Deschênes, O (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Deschênes, O (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",olivier@econ.ucsb.edu; mgreenst@uchicago.edu; joseph.shapiro@yale.edu,,,"NIH [1R21ES019375-01]; NSF [SES-1530494]; California Energy Commission; EPA STAR Fellowship; MIT-BP Fellowship; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1530494] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); California Energy Commission; EPA STAR Fellowship(United States Environmental Protection Agency); MIT-BP Fellowship; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Deschenes: Department of Economics, University of California, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, IZA, and NBER (email: olivier@econ.ucsb.edu); Greenstone: Department of Economics, University of Chicago, 1126 E. 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, and NBER (email: mgreenst@uchicago.edu); Shapiro: Department of Economics, Yale University, 37 Hillhouse Avenue, New Haven, CT 06511, and NBER (email: joseph.shapiro@yale.edu).

Recently, however, this long-held belief'has been challenged. This paper investigates the relationship between CBI and inflation for a large sample (91 countries) covering the period from 1990 to 2014. We follow the previous literature by considering differences across national monetary regimes in explaining this relationship. Our approach also traces the sources of the inflationary phenomenon. Using panel data and the turnover indicator as a proxy for CBI, we offer two main findings. First, we identify the role of exchange rate regimes in the dynamic between inflation and CBI. Second, our results show that only intermediate and flexible exchange rate regimes are appropriate in this relationship. This finding is explained by the level of CBI, which is very low for countries with a fixed exchange rate policy and low income levels. For policymakers, our results highlight the importance of the choice of monetary regime in controlling inflation in the presence of CBI. For public agents, our results provide guidelines for formulating expectations.","[Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, Paris, France; [Aguir, Abdelkader; Smida, Mounir] Univ Sousse, Fac Econ & Business Sousse, MOFID UR13 ES60, Sousse, Tunisia; [Aguir, Abdelkader] Univ Lorraine, CNRS UMR 7522, BETA Lab, Nancy, France",Universite de Sousse; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Ftiti, Z (通讯作者)，EDC Paris Business Sch, 70 Galeries Damiers,Def 1, F-92415 Courbevoie, France.",Zied.Ftiti@edcparis.edu; abdelkader.aguir@univ-lorraine.fr,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104",,,,,60,6,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, the amplification effect of the credit constraint triggered by the housing demand shock on key macroeconomic variables is greatly muted.

Relative to male earnings inequality, the inequality of couples' earnings is both lower in levels and rises by a smaller amount. We also find that couples' earnings instability is lower in levels compared to male earnings instability and actually declines in these data. While wives' earnings played an important role in dampening the rise in inequality and year-to-year variation in resources at the family level, we find that marital sorting and coordination of labor supply decisions at the family level played a minor role.

While the previous literature on this matter proposes that regime changes in the term structure are due to persistent changes in the conditional mean and volatility of interest rates we find that changes in a single parameter that determines the factor loadings of the model better captures regime changes. We show that this model gives superior in-sample forecasting performance as compared to a baseline model and a volatility switching model. In general, we find compelling evidence that the extracted factors from our term structure models are closely related with various economic variables. Furthermore, we investigate and find evidence that the effects of macroeconomic phenomena such as monetary policy, inflation expectations, and real economic activity differ according to the particular regime realized for the term structure. In particular, we identify the periods where monetary policy appears to have a greater effect on the yield curve, and the periods where inflation expectations seem to have a greater effect in yield determination. We also find convincing evidence of a relationship between the regimes estimated by the various switching models with economic activity and monetary policy.","[Levant, Jared] Reg Bank, Birmingham, AL 35242 USA; [Ma, Jun] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Levant, J (通讯作者)，Reg Bank, Birmingham, AL 35242 USA.",jaredmslevant@gamil.com; jma@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,39,9,10,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, in fact, the series of financial crises since 2008 may have interrupted the process of EMU enlargement, which in turn triggered a continuing crisis of confidence in the euro. In this paper we extend the sigma-convergence test to provide a more precise understanding of real interest rate parity (RIP) convergence. On the basis of this, we predict the timing for eliminating the cost of economic asymmetric shocks. Our estimation indicates the RIP among EMU members and accessions were still valid after the disruptions of the 2008 financial crisis. However, the situation has been even worse since the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis, and ceteris paribus, symmetry cannot be achieved without further policy actions. This implies that the EMU authority must do its best to strengthen symmetry and thereby solidify the EMU, at which point it will be better able to re-start the process of enlargement.","[Lin, Ya-Chi] Taiwan Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yeh, Kuo-Chun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lin, YC (通讯作者)，Taiwan Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan.;Yeh, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei, Taiwan.",kuochunyeh@ntu.edu.tw,"Yeh, Kuo-chun/L-8588-2018; Lin, Ya-chi/ACA-8474-2022","Yeh, Kuo-chun/0000-0002-2430-3802; Lin, Ya-chi/0000-0003-3085-7614",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-002-005],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank the editor, three anonymous referees, and Eiji Ogawa for helpful comments and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 105-2410-H-002-005) for financial support.",,27,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using data on managers' pitcher substitution decisions in Major League Baseball, I find that managers remove starting pitchers more often when the next pitch will result in a pitch count ending in zero. Unlike counts ending in nine, pitch counts ending in eight do not exhibit higher substitution rates despite the fact that pitchers usually throw multiple pitches before the manager's next decision opportunity. Managers apparently use rules-of-thumb that emphasize leftmost digits and ignore at least some future consequences of present actions. However, these significant biases disappear when the stakes are high. I find no evidence of disproportionate substitutions on the nine's in close games, and the final digit of the pitch count does not discontinuously affect the probability of winning. Managers act in a manner consistent with rational inattention, using heuristics only when the stakes are low.","[Phillips, David C.] Univ Notre Dame, Wilson Sheehan Lab Econ Opportun, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Phillips, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Wilson Sheehan Lab Econ Opportun, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",David.Phillips.184@nd.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Yet the factors that determine business tax evasion have not been sufficiently examined in the literature in general, and in transition contexts in particular. To address this gap, this study uses the WB/EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) database with a sample of over 12,692 firms from 26 transition economies. Applying various modelling strategies, we argue that tax evasion is a function of firm-level and institutional-level variables. We contribute to the literature by providing robust evidence showing that the perceived tax burden has a positive impact on tax evasion. We also find that the tax evasive behaviour of firms is positively influenced by low trust in government and in the judicial system as well as by higher perceptions of corruption and higher compliance costs. We find that smaller firms, individual businesses and firms in sectors that are less visible to the tax administration are more likely to get involved in evasive behaviour. Overall, institutional factors play an important role in determining firms' tax evasion behaviour in transition economies. This finding has important policy implications.","[Abdixhiku, Lumir] Riinvest Inst, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo; [Krasniqi, Besnik] Univ Prishtina, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo; [Pugh, Geoff; Hashi, Iraj] Staffordshire Univ, Leek Rd, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DF, Staffs, England",Staffordshire University,"Abdixhiku, L (通讯作者)，Riinvest Inst, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo.",hunir.abdixhiltu@riinvestinstitute.org; b.krasniqi@staffs.ac.uk; g.t.pugh@staffs.ac.uk; i.hashi@staffs.ac.uk,"Krasniqi, Besnik A./F-4077-2011; Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019","Krasniqi, Besnik A./0000-0003-2440-3974; Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757",,,,,51,28,29,2,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

However, critics have pointed out that a potential constraint in this agenda is that results from small proof-of-concept studies run by nongovernment organizations may not apply to policies that can be implemented by governments on a large scale. After discussing the potential issues, this paper describes the journey from the original concept to the design and evaluation of scalable policy. We do so by evaluating a series of strategies that aim to integrate the nongovernment organization Pratham's Teaching at the Right Level methodology into elementary schools in India. The methodology consists of reorganizing instruction based on children's actual learning levels, rather than on a prescribed syllabus, and has previously been shown to be very effective when properly implemented. We present evidence from randomized controlled trials involving some designs that failed to produce impacts within the regular schooling system but still helped shape subsequent versions of the program. As a result of this process, two versions of the programs were developed that successfully raised children's learning levels using scalable models in government schools. We use this example to draw general lessons about using randomized control trials to design scalable policies.","[Banerjee, Abhijit] MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerji, Rukmini] Pratham Educ Fdn, New Delhi, India; [Banerji, Rukmini] ASER Ctr, New Delhi, India; [Berry, James] Univ Delaware, Econ, Newark, DE USA; [Duflo, Esther] MIT, Poverty Alleviat & Dev Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kannan, Harini] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA USA; [Mukerji, Shobhini] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, South Asia Reg Ctr, Cambridge, MA USA; [Shotland, Marc] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Training Res Grp, Cambridge, MA USA; [Walton, Michael] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Publ Policy, Cambridge, MA USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev BREAD, Board Directors, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Delaware; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Banerjee, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Banerjee, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",banerjee@mit.edu; rukmini.banerji@pratham.org; jimberry@udel.edu; eduflo@mit.edu; harini.kannan@ifmr.ac.in; shobhini.mukerji@ifmr.ac.in; shotland@mit.edu; michael_walton@hks.harvard.edu,"Kannan, Harini/JXL-8100-2024","Kannan, Harini/0000-0002-7792-2922",William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation; Government of Haryana; Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results,William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation; Government of Haryana; Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results,"Thanks to Richard McDowell, Harris Eppsteiner, and Madeline Duhon for research assistance; to Tamayata Bansal, Sugat Bajracharya, Anupama Deshpande, Blaise Gonda, John Firth, Christian Larroulet, Adrien Lorenceau, Jonathan Mazumdar, Manaswini Rao, Paribhasha Sharma, Joseph Shields, Zakaria Siddiqui, Yashas Vaidya, and Melanie Wasserman for field management; to Diva Dhar for supervision; and to Shaher Bhanu Vagh for the educational test design and analysis.

We build on a relatively large panel of 77 developing countries and examine the period 2002-2012 using different econometric methods. In addition to standard country fixed-effects regressions as well as estimations in first differences, we apply the system Generalised Method of Moments estimator. We, therefore, control for the potential endogeneity of foreign aid. We find that highly targeted aid can be a driver of change: Sectorspecific Aid for Business has a significantly positive impact on regulations across developing countries, but we do not find any effects for overall aid or aid directed at broad governance areas. The result that Aid for Business drives improvements in regulatory quality is robust using different model specifications and country samples. The strongest results are found for low-income countries and for subsamples that exclude outliers. This outcome could partly explain the inconclusive evidence from the previous literature and it confirms our hypothesis that targeted, sector-specific aid matters.","[Busse, Matthias] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Econ & Management, Chair Int Econ, GC 3-145, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Hoekstra, Ruth] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Osei, Robert Darko] ISSER, Legon, Ghana",Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum,"Busse, M (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Econ & Management, Chair Int Econ, GC 3-145, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",matthias.busse@rub.de,"Osei, Robert Darko/K-3822-2019","Busse, Matthias/0000-0002-0471-9472",,,,,35,2,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Moreover, such a learning process in a large developing country can upset the savings behavior of a fully rational expectations advanced country. In a US-China calibration, we show that this effect can be so strong as to explain important current account imbalances, the savings glut hypothesis, as well as the distribution of factor income.

The initiative, propelled in its beginnings by intellectual elites in the United States, Sweden, and some developing countries, mobilized resources to enact policies aimed at reducing fertility by widening contraception provision and changing family-size norms. In the following five decades, fertility rates fell dramatically, with a majority of countries converging to a fertility rate just above two children per woman, despite large cross-country differences in economic variables such as GDP per capita, education levels, urbanization, and female labor force participation. The fast decline in fertility rates in developing economies stands in sharp contrast with the gradual decline experienced earlier by more mature economies. In this paper, we argue that population-control policies likely played a central role in the global decline in fertility rates in recent decades and can explain some patterns of that fertility decline that are not well accounted for by other socioeconomic factors.","[de Silva, Tiloka; Tenreyro, Silvana] London Sch Econ, Econ, London, England; [Tenreyro, Silvana] LSE, Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Tenreyro, Silvana] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"de Silva, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Econ, London, England.",t.s.de-silva@lse.ac.uk; s.tenreyro@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,28,32,13,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using a small-scale New Keynesian monetary framework as laboratory and structural parameters calibrated to the estimates obtained on U.S. data from different macroeconomics regimes, we exploit reduced-form econometric models - such as Vector Autoregressions - to assess their regime-specific forecastability. We show that conducting (pseudo) out-of-sample forecast comparisons in the presence of indeterminacy is a non-trivial exercise, even when sunspot shocks play no role in generating the data. Overall, our simulation experiment suggests that equilibrium indeterminacy need not lead to superior (absolute or relative) forecast accuracy. This finding challenges the view that the deteriorating performance of forecast models over the Great Moderation relative to the Great Inflation was entirely due to changes in the U.S. monetary policy.

With rationed labor markets, raising taxes on the employed and transfers to the unemployed might improve both equity and efficiency. It improves equity by redistributing income from the employed to the unemployed; it improves efficiency as it encourages people with a small utility surplus of employment to exit the labor market, leaving their jobs for people with a higher utility surplus. I derive conditions under which this result continues to hold when only part of the labor market is rationed, when there is both frictional and rationing unemployment, and when rationing endogenously follows from trade unions' monopoly power.

A previous theory concludes that misintermediation can be responsible for business cycles and yields procyclical behavior of surprises in real interest rates. This paper proposes a finite horizon structural model with the introduction of heterogeneous capital to formalize and develop that theory.

The model implied relationship between unanticipated changes in real interest rates and real outputs over time is examined in a subsequent empirical study, which provides preliminary evidence consistent with the hypothesis of misintermediation.

This paper investigates donations made by private enterprises in 2011 using a survey of data covering all 31 provincial-level units of China. The data show that philanthropy practised by Chinese private enterprises is widespread, but the amounts of donations are unequally distributed. Furthermore, donations are positively related to a company's profit and in most cases also to the owner's political participation as expressed in membership in the People's Congress (PC) as well as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at different levels. Donating is also positively related to the presence of a branch of the Communist Party of China and a trade union within the firm. In contrast, there is little support for donations being related to the characteristics of the major owner of the business, such as their gender, age, previous employment experience, party membership or to the governance structure or location of the private firms.","[Gustafsson, Bjoern] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, POB 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Bjoern] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Xiuna] China Dev Res Fdn, Imperial Int Ctr, Floor 15,Tower A,136 Andingmen Wai Ave, Beijing 100011, Peoples R China; [Gang Shuge; Dai Jianzhong] Beijing Acad Social Sci, Inst Sociol, 33 Beisihuan Zhonglu, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Beijing Academy of Social Sciences,"Gustafsson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, POB 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Bjorn.Gustafsson@socwork.gu.se; yangxiuna2005@163.com; gangshuge@hotmail.com; daijianzhong49@163.com,,"Gustafsson, Bjorn/0000-0001-7177-9099",Swedish Research Council - the Swedish Research Links Program; China Scholarship Council (CSC),Swedish Research Council - the Swedish Research Links Program; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This work was supported by a grant from the Swedish Research Council - the Swedish Research Links Program.

To test whether the prospect of losses can induce cooperation, we let experimental subjects play the traveler's dilemma in the gain and loss domain. Subjects cooperate substantially more over losses. Furthermore, our results suggest that this treatment effect is best explained by reference-dependent risk preferences and reference-dependent strategic sophistication.

In our model individual households make their store choices based on their expected basket costs, which are determined by their shopping plans and price beliefs. Previous studies use realized purchases as a proxy for unobserved shopping lists and also assume homogenous price expectation across all households over the entire sample period. Our approach improves the measures of expected basket costs by estimating intended shopping lists of households using a duration model and also by constructing household-, time-, store-, and goods-specific price expectations. In our empirical application using a scanner data set, we find that the store choices become significantly more elastic to prices when the correction is applied. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Implied volatility is more suitable than physical volatility to assess economic effects since it encompass market beliefs adjusted by risk.

The macroeconomic rebound effect measures the effect of an increase in energy efficiency on overall energy demand after markets adjust and re-equilibrate. At the macroeconomic level, energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption through two channels: the macroeconomic price effect and the macroeconomic growth effect. In this paper, we econometrically estimate the macroeconomic energy rebound effect in China. Our results show that there is a statistically significant macroeconomic price rebound effect for China, for each province, and for the short run, intermediate run, and the long run. We also find some evidence of a macroeconomic,growth rebound in the short run and the intermediate run for some years either nation-wide or for some provinces in China; moreover, for some years and some provinces, we cannot reject backfire. The rebound effect is an important phenomenon that the government of China should not neglect when making energy policy, as it affects how improvements in energy efficiency translate into changes in energy consumption.

The model features two agents, one of which becomes the incumbent in each of the two periods and unilaterally decides on investment in a common-interest public good, targeted pork spending and the future executive constraint. While a weak constraint permits an incumbent to enact his desired policies in case of re-election, the same applies to his opponent in the opposite scenario. However, this trade-off changes with the level of the public good, because the agents' shared investment interest dominates their conflict over pork spending to a lesser extent as the efficiency gains from investing get exhausted. In equilibrium, more efficient states of the public good are associated with tighter executive constraints. Despite the fact that agents share the same preferences over public good consumption, equilibrium public good provision is inefficient. Moreover, this inefficiency worsens as the incumbent's re-election chances deteriorate. These findings shed light on why incumbents facing similar electoral environments make different institutional choices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of financial incentives on partially disabled workers,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Disability insurance; Financial incentives,INSURANCE RECEIPT; UNEMPLOYMENT; EARNINGS; ROLLS; RISE,"This study uses longitudinal administrative data from the Netherlands to explore the responsiveness of disabled workers to financial incentives. We focus on workers with partial Disability Insurance (DI) benefits that have substantial residual work capacities. When the first phase of benefit entitlement to DI has expired, these workers experience a dramatic drop in income if they do not employ their residual income capacity. Entitlement, periods to the first phase of DI benefits vary across individuals. This enables us to estimate the impact effect of this change in work incentives on the incidence of work, on wage earnings and on full work resumption. Based on the estimation results, the implied labor force non-participation elasticity rate equals 0.12. Response estimates are highest among young DI recipients, who typically have shorter entitlement periods to the more generous first phase of DI benefits.

Controlling for the location and the year of a child's birth and utilising the timing of the child's death, I find that the experience of a child's death induces a mother's behavioral changes. Mothers, who experienced the death of their first child before the second child was born, were 3.0 percentage points more likely to deliver their second child with professional assistance and 3.9 percentage points more likely to deliver their second child at health facilities than mothers who did not experience the first child's death by the time of the second child's birth. On the other hand, the first child's death after the birth of the second child is not correlated with mother's health service utilisation for the birth of their second child. A set of robustness checks further confirm the effect of a child's death on the subsequent health behavior among mothers. This paper briefly suggests a potential policy based on the findings.","[Sato, Ryoko] World Bank, 701 18th St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA",The World Bank,"Sato, R (通讯作者)，World Bank, 701 18th St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",rsato@worldbank.org,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

However, the preferences among the trilemma can change from country to country, which always is an undetermined issue and full of controversy. This paper comprehensively considers all possible preferences, and formulates interval evaluation results under certain preference. Such formulations are motivated by the observations that it is difficult to reach a consensus about the weights associated with the trilemma, since different weight elicitation methods inevitably produce different weighting schemes. Therefore, we propose an interval decision making problem and apply a Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis to present a holistic measurements of the country-specific energy performance. This differs from the conventional wisdom that assigns exact values to corresponding weights, but explores the weight space to make each country the most preferred one.

Following the literature of threshold regressions, we propose an estimator based on the within-group transformation. Under fixed threshold effect assumption, we establish that the slope and threshold estimators are jointly normally distributed with the same convergence rate Op (N-1/2) and a non-zero asymptotic covariance. We also suggest a sup-Wald test for the presence of kink effect, and derive its limiting distribution. A bootstrap procedure is proposed to obtain the bootstrap p-values to improve the finite sample performance of the test. Monte Carlo simulations show that the FE estimator and the sup-Wald test perform quite well in estimating the unknown parameters and testing for kink effect, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Different studies in the business process field have shown that an organisation can benefit from B.P.M. through better financial and nonfinancial performance, which can drive it to competitive advantage. B.P.M. is also a concept which leads to better organised systems and can help companies in transition economies to perform better. The purpose of this paper is to compare B.P.M. practice in Slovenia and Serbia in order to formulate recommendations for companies in transition economies. The survey was carried out in 115 representatives of Slovene companies and 91 Serbian companies in the year 2014. The conclusions and recommendation for B.P.M. implementation in transition economies were drawn upon similarities in B.P.M. practice between Serbian and Slovenian companies. In addition, the differences in B.P.M. practice were analysed in order to identify the ways one country can learn from the experience of the other. The results from Slovenia and Serbia from 2014 are interesting for both countries from the perspective of how B.P.M. practice could be further developed in Slovenia and Serbia. The findings have significant managerial implications, as they will help managers to better understand the key factors for successful B.P.M. implementation transitional countries companies.","[Stojanovic, Dragana; Tomasevic, Ivan; Slovic, Dragoslav] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia; [Gosnik, Dusan; Kavcic, Klemen] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia; [Suklan, Jana] Sch Adv Social Studies, Nova Gorica, Slovenia",University of Belgrade; University of Primorska,"Kavcic, K (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia.",klemen.kavcic@fm-kp.si,"Stojanović, Dragana Dušanka/ABF-3841-2021; Slovic, Dragoslav/A-4765-2016; Tomašević, Ivan/ABF-3849-2021; Suklan, Jana/AAJ-7025-2020; Suklan, Jana/AAB-1004-2020; Gosnik, Dusan/JVZ-4872-2024","Suklan, Jana/0000-0001-8665-6593; Gosnik, Dusan/0000-0001-5576-8760",,,,,52,7,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Intensified enforcement raises the probability of repeating a grade for children ages 6-13 by 14%, and the likelihood of dropping out of school for youth ages 14-17 by 18%.

We argue that countries with longer statehood experience around the time of colonization were better equipped to implement the legal philosophies transplanted by their colonial powers. Therefore, the implications of receiving British common law versus French civil law should be particularly important in countries with a greater accumulated history of statehood. Using a cross-section of up to 78 former colonies, our results provide support for this hypothesis. In particular, our estimates demonstrate that common law countries have weaker modern climate change policies than civil law countries and the difference is inflated by a longer statehood experience, measured by the length of state history from 1 to 1800 AD. Legal origin has no effect in areas which, by the time of colonization, had no statehood experience. Finally, we report similar results for the pattern of labor market regulations.

The key feature of our framework is that cross-sectional heterogeneity remains finite dimensional. The solution to the model thus admits a statespace representation that can be used to recover the distribution of the model's parameters. Household heterogeneity expands the set of observables to crosssectional moments available at the business-cycle frequency (in addition to the usual macro and monetary time series). Incomplete insurance gives rise to a precautionary motive for holding wealth that propagates aggregate shocks via (i) a stabilizing aggregate supply effect, working through the supply of capital, and (ii) a destabilizing aggregate demand effect coming from the feedback loop between unemployment risk and precautionary saving. Using the estimated model to measure the contribution of precautionary savings to the propagation of recent recessions, we find strong aggregate demand effects during the Great Recession and, to a lesser extent, during the 1990-1991 recession. In contrast, the supply effect at least offsets the demand effect during the 2001 recession.","[Challe, Edouard] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France; [Challe, Edouard] CNRS, CREST, F-75700 Paris, France; [Matheron, Julien] Banque France, Div Res, Paris, France; [Ragot, Xavier] Paris Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France; Paris School of Economics; Emory University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Challe, E (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France.;Challe, E (通讯作者)，CNRS, CREST, F-75700 Paris, France.",edouard.challe@gmail.com; julien.matheron@banque-france.fr; xavier.ragot@gmail.com; juan.rubio-ramirez@emory.edu,,,Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; Chaire FDIR; European Commission [FP7-612796 MACFINROBODS]; National Science Foundation [SES-1227397]; Fondation Banque de France pour la Recherche; Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE); Programa de Excelencia en Educacion e Investigacion of the Bank of Spain; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2011-30323-c03-01],Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Chaire FDIR; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fondation Banque de France pour la Recherche; Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE); Programa de Excelencia en Educacion e Investigacion of the Bank of Spain; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Susanto Basu, Morten Ravn, and Jose-Victor Rios Rull for their feedback on an earlier version of this paper.

While these changes have coincided with benefits like reduced transaction costs, advancements in trading technology, and access to a diverse array of execution venues, regulators and market participants have also raised concerns about the welfare implications of innovations like dark pools as well as the resulting increase in execution complexity. Exchanges are often viewed as natural monopolies due to the presence of network externalities and economies of scale. However, heterogeneity in traders' preferences means that no single venue can serve the interests of all investors. Fragmentation of the marketplace can be seen as a direct outcome of this heterogeneity. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical literature examining the economic arguments and motivations underlying market fragmentation, the resulting implications for liquidity and price efficiency, and the role for public policy. Beyond the concerns for equity markets, the lessons from this literature are relevant for other asset classes experiencing an increase in competition between trading venues.","[Gomber, Peter; Sagade, Satchit; Weber, Moritz Christian] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Sagade, Satchit; Westheide, Christian] Res Ctr SAFE, Frankfurt, Germany; [Theissen, Erik; Westheide, Christian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Mannheim,"Sagade, S (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany.;Sagade, S (通讯作者)，Res Ctr SAFE, Frankfurt, Germany.",sagade@safe.uni-frankfurt.de,"Theissen, Erik/AAN-4732-2020; Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023","Theissen, Erik/0000-0003-4460-8168",Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,"We would like to gratefully acknowledge research support from the Research Center SAFE, funded by the State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE.",,97,19,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Unfortunately, they did not come to a consistent conclusion. Besides, while these studies show whether a specific market is efficient or not, little has been done to explore the issues regarding the degree of market inefficiency. This paper attempts to resolve the puzzle of the inconsistent conclusions in the empirical literature by adopting a bottom-up approach which takes market participants' interactions and coordination into consideration. By simulating an agent-based artificial stock market, this paper concludes with three main findings. First, agents' survivability is mainly decided by risk preference, and not forecasting accuracy. Survivors may have diverse forecasting accuracy. Second, because market prices are not decided by agents based on accurate predictions, markets can not be efficient. What may exist is only the difference of the degree of inefficiency between markets. Third, the more relevant to survivability the forecasting accuracy in a market is, the less inefficient the market will be. Therefore, this paper suggests that it may be better to view the divergent empirical results regarding market efficiency as a fact that markets are inefficient to a variety of degrees.","[Huang, Ya-Chi] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan",,"Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.",estherhyc12@yahoo.com.tw,,,National Science Council [NSC-97-2410-H-262-001],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author gratefully acknowledges the very helpful suggestions of several anonymous referees and the support provided by the National Science Council in the form of Grant no.

Revenue-sharing is extremely attractive to firms that are able to set the revenue shares but often makes the firms that set retail prices worse off. This is so whether revenue-sharing lowers or raises industry profits. These results are strengthened when a market moves from the wholesale model of sales to the agency model of sales, which results in retailers setting revenue shares and suppliers setting retail prices. I also show that retail price-parity restrictions raise industry prices.

We establish the existence and uniqueness/multiplicity of monetary equilibrium in several different cases. The steady-state equilibrium of our model displays several properties that are absent or distinct from those of previous studies. In particular, we find that under egalitarian bargaining, the Friedman rule cannot achieve socially efficient allocation due to asymmetric information. We find that the price of informed high-quality goods is higher than the price of uninformed quality goods. We also find that an increase in inflation can improve product quality.

The treatment variation is the number of payers. We observe that subjects provide the good even if there are many payers so that the costs of provision exceed the benefits by far. This result holds regardless of whether the provision increases the decider's payoff or not. Intriguingly, it is not only selfish or maximin types who provide the good. Rather, we show that a substantial fraction of subjects are insensitive to group size: they reveal to care about the payoff of all parties, but attach the same weight to small and large groups so that they ignore large provision costs that are dispersed among many payers. Our results have important consequences for the approval of policies with concentrated benefits and large, dispersed cost, as well as the analysis of ethical behaviour, medical decision-making, and charity donations.","[Schumacher, Heiner; Kesternich, Iris] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Kosfeld, Michael] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Winter, Joachim] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",KU Leuven; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Munich,"Schumacher, H (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",,,"Kesternich, Iris/0000-0001-9265-6573; Winter, Joachim/0000-0003-2460-619X; Kosfeld, Michael/0000-0003-2427-0825",DFG [SFB-Transregio 15]; Vereinigung von Freunden und Forderern der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt am Main e.V.; Unicredit Universities; Alfons und Gertrud Kassel-Stiftung,DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Vereinigung von Freunden und Forderern der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt am Main e.V.; Unicredit Universities; Alfons und Gertrud Kassel-Stiftung,"Earlier versions of this article were circulated under the title Us and Them: Distributional Preferences in Small and Large Groups.

By using the education arm, a dynamically-efficient welfare state is shown to improve upon long-run laissez faire even when market failures are absent. To release these downstream welfare gains without hurting any transitional generation, help from the pension arm is needed.

Using extensive information from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, we estimate how paid parental leave entitlements influence children's health up to age 7. Exploiting detailed information on children's health, family background, mothers' pre-birth work histories and mothers' health behaviours during pregnancy, we show that paid parental leave entitlements go together with a reduced probability of a child having multiple ongoing health conditions, but show no significant correlation with any single condition. We find that the reduction in multiple conditions is strongest for children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study implies that the provision of paid parental leave for short periods is unlikely to substantially improve child health on average, but may potentially benefit the health of more disadvantaged children.","[Broadway, Barbara; Kalb, Guyonne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kuehnle, Daniel; Maeder, Miriam] FAU Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany",University of Melbourne; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Broadway, B (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",b.broadway@unimelb.edu.au,"Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608; Kuehnle, Daniel/0000-0002-2476-6655",Group of Eight - DAAD Australian-German Research Cooperation Scheme,Group of Eight - DAAD Australian-German Research Cooperation Scheme,"We thank the Group of Eight - DAAD Australian-German Research Cooperation Scheme for funding received for this project.

This paper aims at integrating Kaldor's monetary theory and his view of the relevance of increasing returns. It will be shown that, in Kaldor's view, economic growth is driven by increasing effective demand which, in turn, positively affects the path of labour productivity, and that this mechanism is fully in operation on the condition that the banking sector does not restrict credit supply.

Even though the initial codes were designed against the backdrop of a particular jurisdiction, best practice standards have become remarkably similar across legal traditions. This raises the question whether the codes are sufficiently responsive to local conditions, or standard setters are mainly motivated by the concern not to fall behind internationally accepted benchmark standards. The article quantifies central corporate governance provisions and maps their international diffusion. Controlling for differences in legal families and ownership structure, the article shows that the diffusion of best practice standards leads to a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that a foreign standard setter will adopt a broadly similar provision. The findings indicate that codes are often seen as signaling devices, irrespective of whether or not the adopted standards are well aligned with the domestic economic and legal environment.","[Gerner-Beuerle, Carsten] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Law Dept, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gerner-Beuerle, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Law Dept, London, England.",c.gerner-beuerle@lse.ac.uk,,,"Law and Financial Markets Project, LSE","Law and Financial Markets Project, LSE","I am grateful to John Armour, Dan Awrey, Andre Betzer, Michael Blackwell, Brian Cheffins, Paul Davies, Daniel Ferreira, Lars Hornuf, David Kershaw, Tom Kirchmaier, Edmund-Philipp Schuster, Mathias Siems, Hanne Sondergaard Birkmose, Moqi Xu, Stefan Zeume, the two anonymous reviewers of the JOIE, and the participants of conferences and seminars at Aix-Marseille Universite, Duke University, London School of Economics, National University of Singapore, University of Oxford, Department of Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, and the University of St. Gallen for valuable comments on previous versions of this article.

We argue that the recent business of the global banking industry is not sustainable and we believe that ethical banking may represent one of the alternative models. In the empirical section, we investigate how ethics in the banking business models affects their financial performance. We identified 69 ethical banks and compared them with conventional banks using Bankscope data of more than 80,000 bank-year observations for the 2003-2013 period. We apply the Within-Between estimation method to bank financial indicators of Return on Assets, Return on Equity and their respective volatilities. We conclude that ethical banks report significantly lower volatility in Return on Equity than their conventional counterparts. In addition, the hypothesis that ethical banks would have higher profitability than their peers is not rejected.","[Halamka, Radek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Halamka, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",radek.halamka@gmail.com; petr.teply@vse.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,"Czech Science Foundation [GA 14-02108S, GA 15-00036S]; University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE) [IP 100040]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE),This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Projects No. GA 14-02108S and No. GA 15-00036S) and University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE No. IP 100040).,,24,9,10,1,22,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The difference remains 0.5 when we control for 30 factOrs that reflect the context in which researchers obtain their estimates, such as data frequency, geographical coverage, variable definition, estimation approach, and publication characteristics. We also find that evidence for habits strengthens when researchers use lower data frequencies, employ log-linear approximation of the Euler equation, and utilize open-economy DSGE models.

In the meantime, the industry has experienced heavy merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, especially in the upstream sectors. While these MBA activities may be related to the aggregate M&A waves in the country, they are unique in their own respect. We recognize that the MBA activities in the energy industry in general, and the O&G sectors in particular, can be different from the traditional sense of MM activities. In this paper, we provide some stylized facts on the M&A patterns in the upstream O&G sectors, focusing on the factors that influenced these patterns. Our empirical evidence suggests that among the variables we studied, oil price and O&G production are the most important factors that influence M&A activities, while other variables do not show consistent effect across regions and definitions of M&A. In addition, the MM activities had momentum-building periods and had patterns consistent with a wave hypothesis. Our findings support the notion that industry-specific factors are more important than general economic conditions in determining MM in the O&G industry. We find evidence supporting both the behavioral and neoclassical theories on M&A. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that comprehensive financial reform could increase GDP growth per capita by up to 1.4% points and raise the real bank lending rate by up to 5.1% points. Perhaps the most unexpected result is a massive increase in net capital inflows by up to 20.1% of GDP, which could plant seeds for financial risks later. The probability of a currency crisis could increase by up to 21.7% points, but the probability of a banking crisis may rise or fall, depending on the quality of bank supervision. We also find different policy impacts of different financial reform measures. Bank ownership reform and regulatory reform are critical in supporting economic growth and financial stability. These findings offer important policy implications on how to derive maximum benefit from financial reforms while effectively mitigating potential risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The region has emerged as an important production base for global multinational corporations by joining East Asia's supply chains. While proceeding to establish the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, ASEAN has also forged five major free trade agreements (FTAs) with its dialogue partners (China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Australia-New Zealand) and is currently negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. In addition, four ASEAN member states have completed Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. Econometric evidence suggests that (i) trade flows and inward FDI mutually reinforce each other, i.e., an increase in trade flows stimulates inward FDI and vice versa; (ii) a larger market tends to attract more inward FDI; (iii) FTAs tend to help stimulate inward FDI; and (iv) strong institutions, good physical infrastructure, and low costs of doing business are critical in boosting inward FDI. The paper suggests that in the long run it is ASEAN's interest to further integrate itself with the rest of Asia and the world (through a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and an Asia-Europe FTA), while substantially deepening its internal integration (by moving from the AEC to a customs and economic union) and thereby maintaining ASEAN centrality.","[Kawai, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Naknoi, Kanda] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Tokyo; University of Connecticut,"Naknoi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",mkawai@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kanda.naknoi@uconn.edu,,,S.

This study uses a dictator game experiment with undergraduate students to test how a positive charitable appeal video that highlights similarities between donors and recipients affects donor behavior relative to a traditional guilt appeal video that highlights differences. We find that both feelings of guilt and similarity are positively associated with donation behavior; however, only the guilt-appeal treatment has a statistically significant positive effect on donations relative to the control. Yet, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal donations between similarity- and guilt-based treatments. We also find major gender differences in pro-social behavior: average male donations in the control were 40% higher than female donations; whereas, this outcome is almost completely reversed in the guilt appeal treatment, where females donated over twice as much as males. In other words, guilt appeals appear to induce women's pro-social behavior but have the opposite effect on men. This difference may be partially explained by males' aversion to feelings of manipulation, which seemed to discourage their donations but had no impact on female donations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis employs a global economy wide model and simulates alternative oil prices out to 2050 with and without a price on GHG emissions. In one case considered, based on estimates of available resources, technological progress and energy demand, the reference oil price rises to $124 by 2050. Other cases separately consider constant reference oil prices of $50, $75 and $100, which are targeted by adjusting the quantity of oil resources. In our simulations, higher oil prices lead to more biofuel production, more land being used for bioenergy crops, and fewer GHG emissions. Reducing oil resources to simulate higher oil prices has a strong income effect, so decreased food demand under higher oil prices results in an increase in land allocated to natural forests. We also find that introducing a carbon price reduces the differences in oil use and GHG emissions across oil price cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Many young and middle-aged home owners are paying down large mortgages that leave them precariously positioned on the margins of ownership. As house prices have remained stubbornly high relative to incomes, renters are finding it increasingly difficult to achieve home ownership status. For some low income households, precarious housing circumstances will result in worrying levels of homelessness, which is symptomatic of a housing system that is failing the most vulnerable in society.

Previous studies suggest that emission pricing combined with border carbon adjustment is a second-best instrument, and more cost-effective than output-based rebating. We show that the combination of output-based rebating and a consumption tax for emission-intensive and trade-exposed goods can be equivalent with border carbon adjustment Moreover, it is welfare improving for a region that implements emission pricing along with output-based rebating to introduce such a consumption tax. The welfare gain is particularly large if output-based rebating is already implemented for a sector that is not much exposed to leakage, e.g., due to uncertainty about exposure or due to lobbying activities. Thus, supplementing output-based rebating with a consumption tax constitutes robust policies to mitigate carbon leakage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, we first generate an appropriate database that identifies each industrial production sector with its corresponding price of consumer goods for the euro area. We next estimate a constrained vector autoregressive model. Our findings show a statistically significant increase in producer prices after an oil price shock for branches with high oil consumption, although this statistical pass-through is only partial. However, there is no evidence of a significant oil price pass-through to consumer prices for most branches, which suggests the adaptability of European producers from the most branches to higher oil price pressures without transmitting them to consumers (exceptions: chemical and metal).

This result holds regardless of the mode of competition in the product market, Cournot or Bertrand, as long as the rivals' R&D decisions are strategic substitutes. It can generate new empirical implications and can provide an explanation for the lack of strong empirical support in the literature for a negative relationship between risk and incentives.

We characterize the conditions under which private property owners will control or eradicate, and determine how this decision depends on property-specific environmental features and on the behavior of other landowners. We show that high mobility or lower control by others result in lower private control. But when the marginal dynamic cost of the bad is sufficiently large, we find that global eradication may be privately optimal in these cases, eradication arises in the non-cooperative game and is also socially optimal so there is, in effect, no externality.

We examine the design of these policies to minimize the total (public and private) costs for meeting a one-billion-gallon biofuel mandate by using miscanthus as feedstock. We find that a high degree of risk aversion, high discount rate, credit constraint, and availability of crop insurance for conventional crops can increase the cost of producing enough biomass for a one-billion-gallon biofuel mandate by up to 43% and increase the land required by 16% as compared to otherwise; removal of subsidized crop insurance and credit constraints could lower these costs by 50%. We find that in most cases the cost-effective energy crop insurance subsidy rate is 0% whereas the cost-effective establishment cost subsidy rate is 100%. Relative to the case with no policy intervention for energy crops, energy crop insurance can reduce the total costs (net of government expenditures on subsidies) of meeting the 1 billion gallon mandate by 1.3% whereas establishment cost subsidy can reduce these costs by 34%.

We study the short run effects of the arrival of democracy on different measures of women's empowerment by exploiting exogenous variation in the government through abolition of the monarchy. This paper employs a propensity score matching estimator to evaluate the linkage between change in political regime and opinions related to women's empowerment from 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). Results show that women's say in decision making increased significantly, and opinions on violence against women strengthened. We further scrutinize the treatment effect estimates with Rosenbaum bounds and observe if they are sensitive to possible hidden selection bias. We also test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect across gender and find that males report higher probability of mutual household decision-making among couples than females.

In this paper we show that in many dynamic games of interest, this correct beliefs assumption may be incompatible with a very basic form of forward induction reasoning: the first two layers of extensive-form rationalizability (Pearce, 1984; Battigalli, 1997, epistemically characterized by Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002). Hence, forward induction reasoning naturally leads us away from equilibrium reasoning. In the second part we classify the games for which equilibrium reasoning is consistent with this type of forward induction reasoning, and find that this class is very small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We show that first and second price auctions are payoff equivalent when some bidders are financially constrained, so sellers are indifferent to adopt either format. We characterize possible equilibria and show that if the budget is high, then sellers compete via fixed pricing, if it is low then they compete via auctions, and if it is moderate then they mix, so both mechanisms coexist. The budget constraint becomes less binding if sellers use entry fees. Interestingly an improvement of the budget-e.g. letting customers pay in installments-may lead to fewer trades and a loss of efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This effect of fiscal policy is as large as the effect of trade linkages on comovement and stronger than the effects of several other common financial and investment linkages.

We explore how the crisis and changes in the labor, housing, and financial markets might have impacted retirement patterns of Spanish men and women nearing retirement age. We find that the recession primarily reduced women's retirement likelihood by 27%. The effect, which was associated with the labor market deterioration, as captured by higher unemployment rates, was circumscribed to women already at work, who chose to stay at work longer. In contrast, for the most part, men's retirement likelihood did not change with the labor, housing, and financial market fluctuations. Overall, the findings suggest that working women might have prolonged their working lives to make up for lost household income.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Borra, Cristina] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Sevilla,"Amuedo-Dorantes, C (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu,"Borra, Cristina/E-6281-2010; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020; Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018","Borra, Cristina/0000-0003-2277-8342; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X;",,,,,30,2,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The program offers yearly cash bonuses to teachers in a sample of 600 public primary schools with the lowest mean student exam scores in the province. The bonus is linked to the change in the school's average student exam scores, the change in the school's enrollment, and the level of student exam participation in the school. Bonus receipt and size are randomly assigned across schools according to whether or not the teacher is the school's head. The program increases student exam participation rates in the second and third year and increases enrollment in grade 1 in the third year. We do not find that the program increases student exam scores in any year. Mean impacts are similar across program variants. The absence of positive impacts on test scores may be due to weaknesses in the program's incentive structure and/ or limitations in the program's administrative data.

In this paper we test several important aspects of market behavior. Specifically we examine the extent to which large changes in risk premia amongst the countries that encountered crises were related to news. We also investigate whether the impact of good and bad news was symmetrical. Finally we explore whether changes in risk premia in Greece affected risk premia in other countries in an asymmetrical and biased way. We discover that while there is considerable evidence that financial markets often performed in an efficient way during the crisis, there are also important departures from this pattern that are consistent with the behavioral approach. Our findings imply that both the efficient and behavioral approaches are helpful when trying to understand how markets perform.","[Bird, Graham; Willett, Thomas] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Bird, Graham; Du, Wenti; Willett, Thomas] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Du, Wenti] Akita Int Univ, Akita, Japan",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Akita International University,"Bird, G (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.;Bird, G (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",graham.bird@claremontmckenna.edu,,,,,,,40,12,16,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The optimal outcome can be implemented by modifying a sequential voting scheme that is used in many legislatures and committees. The modification uses a flexible majority threshold for each of several alternatives, and allows us to replicate, via a single sequential procedure, the entire class of anonymous, unanimous, and dominant strategy incentive compatible mechanisms.

We find that envy can induce a violation of the univariate first-degree stochastic dominance (FSD), and thus a violation of the classic expected utility monotonicity axiom. Surprisingly, altruism can also violate FSD preferences. The intuitive explanation of the result in the case of altruism hinges on the sign of the mixed derivative of the bivariate preference: the individual might prefer a certain correlation between her wealth and her peer group's wealth, and is therefore willing to violate FSD as long as the outcomes of the two parties are ordered according to her preferences. When investments are considered, envy and altruism can distort not only preferences but also actual choices.","[Kaplanski, Guy] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Levy, Haim] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Bar Ilan University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Kaplanski, G (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",guykap@biu.ac.il; mshlevy@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Kaplanski, Guy/J-2890-2013","Kaplanski, Guy/0000-0002-2391-912X",Kruger Center for the Finance of the Hebrew University,Kruger Center for the Finance of the Hebrew University,We thank the Kruger Center for the Finance of the Hebrew University for its financial support.,,60,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

While empirical research has advanced our understanding of the phenomenon considerably, we argue that one conclusion that many studies have reached is preliminary. Some recent research contends that only full-scale war, and not force short of war, has a discernable impact on human welfare or physical quality of life (PQOL). We develop theory on one type of force short of war, large-scale foreign military intervention (FMI), and its potential effects on PQOL. Using interrupted time series and panel corrected standard error methodologies, we find that from 1960 to 2005 large-scale FMI had a statistically and substantively significant impact on the PQOL of populations in 106 developing countries.

The intervention consists of home visits and targets socially disadvantaged first-time mothers to improve child development. The effects on child development were assessed via developmental tests in a randomized controlled trial. Home visits significantly improved girls' cognitive development during the first 24 months after birth. In contrast, the intervention had no effect on boys. These gender-specific outcomes can be explained by greater increases in parental investment (e.g. reading to the child) for girls than for boys. Our results demonstrate that early childhood interventions have an effect on early cognitive child development, although concentrated on girls, in a country where a wide range of additional support services are available for disadvantaged mothers with young children.","[Sandner, Malte; Jungmann, Tanja] Univ Rostock, Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigswortherpl 1,August Bebel Str 28, D-18051 Rostock, Germany",University of Rostock; Leibniz University Hannover,"Sandner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigswortherpl 1,August Bebel Str 28, D-18051 Rostock, Germany.",,"Jungmann, Tanja/AGJ-3407-2022","Jungmann, Tanja/0000-0001-8530-2857; Sandner, Malte/0000-0001-8579-4775","German Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) [IIA6-25080820V6]; State Ministry of Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, Saxony; TUI Foundation; Durr and Reimann-Dubbers Foundations","German Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ); State Ministry of Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, Saxony; TUI Foundation; Durr and Reimann-Dubbers Foundations","Financial support by the German Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) (Grant no.

This particular finding is probably the result of the failure of educated Egyptians to achieve a better life despite their investments in human capital - due to the lack of opportunity that accompanied the failure of the country's Arab Spring to change the political and social environment.","[Silver, Hannah C.] Waddell & Reed Financial Advisors, Tallahassee, FL 32312 USA; [Caudill, Steven B.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Mixon, Franklin G., Jr.] Columbus State Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, Columbus, GA USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University,"Silver, HC (通讯作者)，Waddell & Reed Financial Advisors, Tallahassee, FL 32312 USA.",silver.hannah@gmail.com; scaudill@fau.edu; mixon_franklin@columbusstate.edu,,,,,,,41,7,7,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

To this end, Grossman's (2000) partial-equilibrium framework with endogenous health is incorporated in an otherwise standard Real-Business-Cycle (RBC) model. Health status in this setup is modelled as a utility-enhancing, intangible, and non-transferrable capital stock, which depreciates over time. The household can improve their health (produce health') through investment using a health-recovery technology. The main results are: (i) overall, the model compares well vis-a-vis data; (ii) the behaviour of the price of healthcare is adequately approximated by the shadow price of health in the model; (iii) the model-generated health variable exhibits moderate- to high correlation with a large number of empirical health indicators.","[Vasilev, Aleksandar] Amer Univ Bulgaria, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria",American University Bulgaria,"Vasilev, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Bulgaria, Dept Econ, 1 Georgi Izmirliev Sq, Blagoevgrad 2700, Bulgaria.",avasilev@aubg.bg,"Vasilev, Aleksandar/ADZ-7753-2022","Vasilev, Aleksandar/0000-0002-3956-6314",,,,,19,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Unlike previous studies that focus solely on income, this paper pays more heed to job satisfaction. Based on data drawn from China General Social Survey, we find that disadvantaged job seekers rely primarily on informal channels; whereas experienced and better-educated job seekers tend to search for jobs through formal channels. However, those reaping the largest benefit from using networks are the job seekers who are able to use formal and informal channels jointly. By disaggregating the whole sample, we further find that the promoting effect of network use is contingent on factors such as gender and types of jobs. Network use brings about larger benefits to female and job seekers target to prestigious occupations. Finally, it appears that whether a job seeker can receive influential help depends primarily on the social status of the contacts rather than their tie strength. The results of our paper thus urge us to examine the combination of different searching strategies rather than studying them separately. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This technique allows us to incorporate the characteristic features of electricity prices (such as seasonal volatility, time varying mean reversion and seasonally occurring price spikes) into the model in an elegant and economically justifiable way. The stochastic time change introduces stochastic as well as deterministic (e.g., seasonal) features in the price process' volatility and in the jump component. We specify the base process as a mean reverting jump diffusion and the time change as an absolutely continuous stochastic process with seasonal component. The activity rate of the stochastic time change can be related to the factors that influence supply and demand. Here we use the temperature as a proxy for the demand and hence, as the driving factor of the stochastic time change, and show that this choice leads to realistic price paths. We derive properties of the resulting price process and develop the model calibration procedure. We calibrate the model to the historical EEX power prices and apply it to generating realistic price paths by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the simulated price process matches the distributional characteristics of the observed electricity prices in periods of both high and low demand. (C) 2017 The Authors.

If players are to coordinate on an efficient equilibrium, they must believe that others will coordinate with them. In many settings there is uncertainty about beliefs as well as strategies. Do people consider these higher-order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs) when making coordination decisions? I design a modified stag hunt experiment that allows me to identify how these higher-order beliefs and uncertainty about higher-order beliefs matter for coordination. Players prefer to invest especially when they believe that others are optimistic that they will invest; but knowledge that others think them unlikely to invest does not cause players to behave differently than when they do not know what their partners think about them. Thus resolving uncertainty about beliefs can result in marked efficiency gains.","[Bosworth, Steven J.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Bosworth, SJ (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",steven.bosworth@ifw-kiel.de,,,Kiel Institute for the World Economy,Kiel Institute for the World Economy,"The author wishes to thank professor Lise Vesterlund for advice and support, professor Stephanie Wang for help in experimental design, seminar participants at the University of Pittsburgh, attendees at the 2012 Economic Science Association World and North American meetings, and participants at the 2015 Thurgau Experimental Economics Meeting.

Our findings reveal that the great majority of diesel price ratios maintain stable long run relationships. We also find that while price ratios take longer to adjust for pairs of petrol stations that are farther apart, adjustment is quicker when pairs of petrol stations provide the same range of services, and when they belong to the same owner.

We show that, larger affiliates of large investors compete better and survive longer. Being part of a network of affiliates in the same country and/or sector improves firm survival probability. When investors have a higher (lower) technological level than their affiliates, the affiliates' failure probability increases (decreases).

I use the placement of foreign direct investment during the Celtic Tiger, the large economic expansion in Ireland during the 1990s, to estimate the impact of local job growth on the likelihood that young adults leave home. This paper contributes to the literature by exploiting an exogenous shock to the local labor market to identify the main effect of employment growth on home leaving behavior. The results show that local economic growth increases the probability that young adults leave home particularly for the well-educated young adults most likely to be employed in the factories that opened during the period.","[Wiemers, Emily E.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Wiemers, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",emily.wiemers@umb.edu,,,,,,,45,3,3,2,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

(2014). Participants select from among sets of standard playing cards valued by a simple formula. In some sessions, participants are given a prepayment associated with some of the cards, which need not be the earnings-maximizing ones. Hochman et al. (2014) find that participants choose an earnings-maximizing card less frequently when another card is prepaid. We replicate this result under the original instructions, but not with instructions which explain the payment process more explicitly. Participants who state they do not consider themselves good at mathematics make earnings-maximizing choices much less frequently overall, but those who express self-confidence in mathematics drive the treatment effect. The results suggest that even when comparisons among choices require only simple quantitative reasoning steps, market designers and regulators may need to pay close attention to how the terms of offers are expressed, explained, and implemented.

In the aftermath of the crisis, bank behavior toward depositors also alters. Ahead of the crisis, banks did not significantly respond to the discipline exerted by depositors, however, banks begin offering higher rates to curb deposit withdrawals afterwards. Our findings suggest that the implementation of macroprudential tools seem to have a positive impact on financial stability, since, in the post-2008 period, regulatory supervision have been more firmly assisted by the market.","[Aysan, Ahmet Faruk; Ozturk, Huseyin] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Anafartalar Mah Istiklal Cad 10,Ulus Alti, Ankara, Turkey; [Disli, Mustafa] Univ Ghent, St Pietersnieuwstraat 33, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Ghent University,"Ozturk, H (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Anafartalar Mah Istiklal Cad 10,Ulus Alti, Ankara, Turkey.",ahmet.aysan@tcmb.gov.tr; mustafa.disli@ugent.be; huseyin.ozturk@tcmb.gov.tr,"Aysan, Ahmet/ABD-9167-2021","Aysan, Ahmet/0000-0001-7363-0116; Disli, Mustafa/0000-0003-0584-0060; Ozturk, Huseyin/0000-0001-7511-1061",,,,,36,3,5,0,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

A discrepant replication, in current usage of the term, can signal anything from an unremarkable disagreement over methods to scientific incompetence or misconduct. This paper proposes a standard for classifying one study as a replication of some other study. It is a standard that places the burden of proof on a study to demonstrate that it should have obtained identical results to the original, a conservative standard that is already used implicitly by many researchers. It contrasts this standard with decades of unsuccessful attempts to harmonize terminology, and argues that many prominent results described as replication tests should not be described as such. Adopting a conservative standard like this one can improve incentives for researchers, encouraging more and better replication tests.","[Clemens, Michael A.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA",,"Clemens, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA.",mclemens@cgdev.org,,,,,,,159,98,98,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To handle endogeneity issues arising from the unobservable time variant features of electoral races, we build on the literature which shows that politicians' educational level is positively affected by their wage and apply a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design on the basis of the fact that the wages of mayors in Italy increase non-monotonically at different thresholds.

We find that, unlike what is found in the literature, optimal nominal exchange rate is flexible under local-currency pricing.

Will stricter pollution controls drive away the foreign firms that have helped spur growth in China? This paper studies the effects of the Two-Control-Zone (TCZ) pollution control policy on foreign firms' exit behavior in China. Based on firm-level data from 1998 to 2009, we find that foreign firms' responses are not significantly different from domestic firms on average once environmental regulations impose an added cost of business. However, foreign firms' responses to stricter pollution controls tend to differ based on various firm characteristics. Our estimation indicates that larger size, higher productivity and exporting all make foreign firms less likely to exit than similar domestic firms in regions with stricter pollution control.

Motivated by evidence from psychology, unemployment is modeled as a social norm. The norm is defined here as the belief that individuals in society prioritize, or should prioritize the search for gainful employment, whereas those who do not are perceived as outside the norm and, consequently, stigmatized. Households pressure the unemployed to find jobs: the fewer unemployed workers there are, the more supporters the norm has and therefore the greater the pressure and psychological cost experienced by each jobseeker. As this psychological cost is procyclical, it hinders the wage from absorbing most of the effect of the shock. Thus, the model is able to capture the high volatility of vacancies and unemployment observed in the data, accounting for the Shimer puzzle. The paper also departs from the literature by introducing price rigidity in the labor market, inducing additional inertia and persistence in inflation and the real wage after a monetary shock. The model's responses after a monetary shock are in line with the responses obtained from a VAR on US data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, we empirically study the relationship between luminosity data and regional incomes for those countries for which regional income data are available. Second, we use our estimation results for an out-of-sample prediction of regional incomes based on the luminosity data. These results enable us to investigate regional income differentials in developing countries that lack official income data. Third, we calculate commonly used measures of regional inequality within countries based on predicted incomes. An investigation of changes in the dispersion of regional incomes over time reveals that approximately 67-70% of all countries experience sigma-convergence. Forth, we study different major determinants of within-country changes in inequality, i.e., the determinants of the convergence process. We find evidence for an N-shaped relationship between development and regional inequality.

This paper examines how financial constraints determine whether firms export directly or indirectly, and how this choice affects firm performance. For this investigation, we use the most recent Chinese private firm-level data, collected in 2011 by the World Bank. We establish two main results. First, indirect exporters face higher financial constraints than direct exporters. Second, indirect exporters are less productive and profitable than direct exporters. In addition, we rationalize these patterns with a simple model that incorporates credit constraints and imperfect contractibility in companies' export decisions. Our results imply that although globalization allows more firms in developing countries to enter the global market through indirect exporting, limited access to capital restricts firms to exporting directly and precludes them from pursuing more profitable opportunities.","[Lin, Faqin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Lin, FQ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",linfaqin@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503281]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Young Elite Teacher Project of Central University of Finance and Economics,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Young Elite Teacher Project of Central University of Finance and Economics,"I am grateful to the Editor, Professor Raouf Boucekkine, and two anonymous referees for their invaluable comments that helped to improve this paper.

The platform provider is uncertain about the strength of the externality each side is exerting on the other. Setting participation fees on both sides, it gradually learns about these externalities by observing actual participation levels. This provides an informational rationale for introductory pricing, with the platform provider charging a fee below the myopically optimal level on at least one side of the market. If the externality that the other side exerts is sufficiently well known and weaker than the externality it experiences, the platform provider extracts surplus from that side by charging it a fee above the myopically optimal level.

Policy functions approximated around the steady state will be inaccurate away from the steady state. In some cases the model may not have a well-defined steady state, or the nature of the steady state may be at odds with its off-steady-state dynamics. We show how to simulate a DSGE model with no well-defined steady state by approximating about the current state. Our method minimizes the error associated with a finite-order Taylor-series expansion of the model's characterizing equations. This method is easily implemented and has the advantage of mimicking highly non-linear behavior. It also requires choosing N out of 2N possible roots from a matrix quadratic equations and the choice of this root not obvious away from the steady state. HoweVer, simulations show that using the same criteria as when linearizing about the steady state yield reasonable, well-fitting results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals differ in policy preferences and decide either to take part in lobbying activities or not. They are assumed to be group rule-utilitarian such that they follow the rule that, if followed by everyone else in their special interest group, would maximize their group's aggregate welfare. Once formed, lobbies make contributions to the incumbent government in exchange for a policy favor as in a common-agency model. I show the existence of equilibrium with two organized lobbies. Individuals with more extreme preferences are more likely to join lobbying activities. Therefore, the lobbyists are rather extremists than moderates. However, the competition between those extreme lobbies results in a more moderate policy outcome relative to that initially preferred by the biased government. Lobbies therefore guard against extremism, while acting as moderators of the government's preferences.","[Zudenkova, Galina] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Zudenkova, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",galina.zudenkova@gmail.com,"Zudenkova, Galina/KCJ-5560-2024","Zudenkova, Galina/0000-0002-0008-2427",Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation,Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation,"The author is grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Antonio Cabrales, Filipe Campante, Luis Corchon, Jacques Cremer, M.

In particular, portfolios that contain small and value stocks have significant and negative uncertainty betas, whereas portfolios of large and growth stocks exhibit positive and significant uncertainty betas. Using a quasi-natural experimental setting around the financial crisis, we confirm the differential sensitivity of small versus big and value versus growth portfolios to aggregate uncertainty.

We find, in the long run, a 1% increase in the rate of inflation leads to approximately a 0.0046% increase in capacity utilization. The asymmetric error correction structure shows that changes in capacity utilization show significant corrective measures only during booms while changes in inflation correct during both phases of the business cycle with the corrections being stronger during recessions. We also find that, in the short run, changes in the inflation rate do Granger cause capacity utilization while changes in capacity utilization do not Granger cause inflation. The Granger causality from inflation to capacity utilization can be interpreted as supporting recent calls made in the popular press by some economists that it may be desirable for the Federal Reserve Bank to try to induce some inflation. However, it is also possible to interpret these Granger causality results as arising because both variables respond to some more fundamental set of variables with the inflation rate simply responding sooner. The lack of Granger causality from capacity utilization to inflation casts doubt on the older view that capacity utilization could be a leading indicator for future inflation.","[Ahmed, M.

The authors use instrumental variable quantile regression and data from the Swiss Labor Force Survey to identify the causal link between education and wages at different quantiles of the conditional distribution of wages. The results provide evidence that there is no unique causal effect of schooling and that for each individual the effect may deviate from those extensively documented by ordinary least squares or two-stage least squares. In particular, while ordinary quantile regression estimates increasing returns in the quantile index, once the endogeneity of schooling is taken into account the authors instead observe higher returns at lower quantiles of the wage distribution. Interpreting the quantile index as a measure of unobserved ability, the results suggest that higher ability individuals have higher wages, but the slope of their wage-education profile is flatter than that for lower ability individuals.","[Balestra, Simone; Backes-Gellner, Uschi] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Balestra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",simone.balestra@uzh.ch,"Backes-Gellner, Uschi/D-6652-2014","Backes-Gellner, Uschi/0000-0002-7511-9757","Swiss National Science Foundation [PBZHP1-147219]; Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology through Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behavior and Training Policies; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PBZHP1_147219] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology through Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behavior and Training Policies; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We are grateful to Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, Giorgio Brunello, David Card, Thomas Dee, Yingying Dong, Joop Hartog, Guido Imbens, Simon Janssen, Matthias Krapf, Edward Lazear, Pedro Martins, Hessel Oosterbeek, Aderonke Osikominu, Eric Taylor, Niels Westergaard-Nielsen, and Ludger Woessmann for their constructive comments and valuable help.

As byproducts, we prove that many auction games with correlated types admit an approximate equilibrium, and that many competition models have a sharing rule solution.","[Bich, Philippe] Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, UMR 8174, Paris, France; [Laraki, Rida] Univ Paris 09, CNRS, LAMSADE, Paris, France; [Laraki, Rida] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Bich, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, UMR 8174, Paris, France.",bich@univ-paris1.fr; rida.laraki@polytechnique.edu,,"Laraki, Rida/0000-0002-4898-2424",ANR [ANR-10-BLAN 0112],ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank Panayotis Mertikopoulos and Christina Pawlowitsch for their useful comments.

These preferences have been shown to lead to price premiums and subsequent underperformance. This study extends this growing body of literature by testing whether the underperformance of stocks with positive skewness is driven by periods of high investor sentiment. The motivation for these tests is based on a broad literature in Psychology that an individual's mood can directly affect the individual's subjective probability assessments. In the framework of our tests, more optimism among investors may strengthen investors' skewness preferences. The empirical results in this study support this idea as the underperformance of positively skewed stocks is shown to be primarily driven by periods of high investor sentiment.","[Blau, Benjamin M.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Blau, BM (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ben.blau@usu.edu,,"Blau, Benjamin/0000-0002-5260-3378",,,,,28,7,7,1,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, there is very scant research on the factors underlying the World Trade Organization (WTO) members' regulatory process. The aim of this paper is to fill that gap, examining the main determinants for the development of SPS regulation considering the notifications presented by WTO members. A negative binomial regression was estimated, where the dependent variable was the number of SPS measures notified during the period 1995-2012 by WTO members, while the explanatory variables were related to each country: (1) agricultural production value; (2) agricultural imports weight; (3) health concerns; (4) agricultural import tariffs; and (5) scientific and legal capacities. The results provide evidence that legal and scientific capacities are major factors in the number of notifications presented by WTO members. On the other hand, those countries with a higher relative weight of the agricultural sector in the economy or of agricultural products in their imports have notified fewer SPS measures. This leads to the conclusion that it is necessary to reinforce actions that strengthen institutional and technical capacities for further convergence.","[Boza, Sofia; Munoz, Jazmin] Univ Chile, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Boza, Sofia; Munoz, Jazmin] Univ Chile, Inst Int Studies, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Boza, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile.;Boza, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Inst Int Studies, Santiago, Chile.",sofiaboza@u.uchile.cl,"Boza, Sofia/I-6122-2016",,,,,,45,5,7,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The key idea of this article is to explain the importance of the attitude of a host community towards foreign migrants in the system of social identity formation for both of these groups, since this influences the quality of human capital. From the perspective of social construction theory, the authors of the article analyze the problems of forming a common Russian identity among the citizens of Ekaterinburg (Russia) and migrants of different ethnicities from Central Asia. Using the methods of questionnaire survey, correlation analysis, analysis of social distance based on the Bogardus scale, and analysis for study groups, the authors define a set of cultural factors that determine attitudes towards migrants of different ethnicities. The authors of the article are sure that forming a common social identity for members of the host community and migrants of different ethnicities is complicated by the divergence of their cultural norms and rules and the reluctance of the host community to change under the conditions of the transformation of the external environment due to migration streams. The fact that the hosts do not understand the expedience of receiving so many external migrants also has a large impact.","[Britvina, Irina; Savchuk, Galina; Shumilova, Polina] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Britvina, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",irina.britvina@urfu.ru; galina.savchuk@urfu.ru; polina_shumilova@mail.ru,"Britvina, Irina/N-9616-2013; Shumilova, Polina/Q-1831-2016; Savchuk, Galina/AAM-8922-2021",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [No16-33-00010/17-O],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),The work was supported by grant No16-33-00010/17-O Gamma OH P Phi Phi(sic) provided by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.,,11,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,205,214,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300020,0

The proportion of public-to-private sources is on average approximately 43:57 in both regions. However, overall private sources of financing are significantly higher than funds obtained from public sources when we compare average values without respect to geographical regions. Furthermore, using a seemingly unrelated regression model, we identify dominant sources of public funding - in the European clusters dominate European Union budgets (24.29%), and for American clusters, the more prevailing sources are national (26.25%) and local budgets (10%).","[Burger, Peter] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Baumohl, Eduard] Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia; [Vyrostova, Eva] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Publ Adm, Dept Econ & Management Publ Adm, Popradska 66, Kosice 04132, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; University of Economics Bratislava; University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,"Burger, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",peter.burger@tuke.sk; eduard.baumohl@euba.sk; eva.vyrostova@upjs.sk,"Baumohl, Eduard/K-3195-2014; Výrostová, Eva/AEJ-8710-2022; Burger, Peter/AAH-4330-2019","Baumohl, Eduard/0000-0002-5444-7348; Výrostová, Eva/0000-0003-2446-2421; Burger, Peter/0000-0002-7512-4660",Slovak Grant Agency for Science (VEGA) [1/0402/15],Slovak Grant Agency for Science (VEGA)(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This work was supported by the Slovak Grant Agency for Science (VEGA project No. 1/0402/15).,,48,2,2,0,4,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The methodology of this paper is similar to that of Artis and Zhang (1997), Boreiko (2003), and Crowley (2013), who also focused on the European convergence process. This paper is based on the thesis that the convergence process is proven if the clusters are gathering in shorter squared Euclidean distances during the time, or, alternatively, if the distances between European Union economies and Germany are shorter. First, in order to perform the cluster analysis, the convergence criteria are identified (the choice of the criteria is based on optimum currency area). Second, with regards to the criteria, we conduct thirteen cluster analyses for every year of the period 2001 - 2013. From this perspective, we focus on the differences between the analyses' outputs during the time. According to our results, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the economic convergence process in the EU was not proven.","[Burian, Stanislav; Frydrych, Jakub] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Burian, S (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Theories, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",burians@pef.czu.cz; frydrych@pef.czu.cz,"Frydrych, Jakub/B-2182-2017","Frydrych, Jakub/0000-0002-0292-4229; Burian, Stanislav/0000-0003-0643-8348","Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences [20151041]","Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences","This paper was financed by grant No. 20151041 from Internal Grant Agency of Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences.",,22,1,1,0,4,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

In reviewing recent literature, this article tackles the theme of measurement and assessment of the logistics and infrastructure divide with reference to the search for greater logistic efficiency and territorial competitiveness, in function of the specificities of local production systems and pursuable models of development in the global context. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to review the prevailing methods used to estimate regional efficiency and logistics competitiveness and to focus on an Italian case study. Focusing on the application of an original composite index to the Italian case study, the main insight of our analysis is that composite indicators could help policy-makers to evaluate the requirements of infrastructural interventions and logistics services, in close keeping with the characteristics of the local economic system.","[Carlucci, Fabio] Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II,132, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy; [Cira, Andrea] Univ Messina, Via Verdi,75, I-98122 Messina, Italy; [Forte, Ennio] Univ Naples Federico II, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Siviero, Lucio] Univ Catania, Corso Italia,55, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Messina; University of Naples Federico II; University of Catania,"Cira, A (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Via Verdi,75, I-98122 Messina, Italy.",acira@unime.it,,"CARLUCCI, Fabio/0000-0003-2911-6528",,,,,50,12,13,0,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The article includes 75% sample of the total population of bank to bank domestic acquisitions within the U.K. and cross-border acquisitions within the E.U. from 2006 until 2013. The article comes to the conclusion, by the means of event study methodology, that the shareholders returns of acquiring banks are negative and statistically insignificant (-2.076%) when they acquire cross-border banks. The results of U.K. banks acquiring domestic banks indicates higher and statistically significant abnormal returns of 1.628% at 5% significance level as compared to cross-border returns gained by U.K. acquiring banks. The research found an overall insignificant abnormal return of -0.448% for shareholders of the acquiring banks for the entire portfolio. It can be concluded that, on average, shareholders of the acquiring banks experience negative abnormal returns and acquisitions do create (short-term) abnormal returns for the acquiring banks' shareholders around the acquisition announcement time.","[Chaudary, Samra] Lahore Sch Econ, Business Adm, Lahore, Pakistan; [Mirza, Nawazish] SP Jain Sch Global Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Lahore School of Economics,"Chaudary, S (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Business Adm, Lahore, Pakistan.",ch.samra@gmail.com,"Mirza, Nawazish/F-9388-2010; Chaudary, Samra/ADX-2462-2022","Mirza, Nawazish/0000-0003-4265-9519; Chaudary, Samra/0000-0002-4498-6444",,,,,40,4,4,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Findings suggest point spreads are too large in these situations, providing a profitable betting opportunity for those willing to systematically wager on underdogs. Similar findings are not seen within the context of NFL or NBA regular seasons. These findings are more pronounced as preseason point spreads become larger.

Its effects were proportionately stronger eastbound, but less important in absolute numbers given smaller eastbound traffic. Collusion-driven consumer substitution across classes was small but non-negligible. Thus, collusion affected migrant traffic far more than tourist/business traffic. We also confirm that collusion led to higher fares across all cabin classes, especially for steerage. We construct and calibrate an analytical model and show that the pattern of observed prices and volumes are consistent with a profit-maximizing cartel, thus buttressing the hypothesis that the collusion effects were causal.

Using econometric analysis, authors predicted three scenarios of electricity consumption in Russia depending on the amount of energy losses in the networks, the volume of production of electricity, including energy from renewable sources.","[Gomonov, Konstantin; Berezin, Andrey; Matyushok, Vladimir; Balashova, Svetlana] RUDN Univ, Ul Miklukho Maklaya 6, Moscow 117198, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Gomonov, K (通讯作者)，RUDN Univ, Ul Miklukho Maklaya 6, Moscow 117198, Russia.",k.gomonov@gmail.com; Aberezin004@gmail.com; vmatyushok@mail.ru; sveta.b2@gmail.com,"Matyushok, Vladimir/A-2915-2017; Balashova, Svetlana/N-8285-2016; Gomonov, Konstantin/AAB-2326-2019; Berezin, Andrey/J-5970-2016","Balashova, Svetlana/0000-0003-1797-8825; Gomonov, Konstantin/0000-0001-6288-8664; Berezin, Andrey/0000-0001-9250-5177",RFBR [17-06-00581\17],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The reported study was partially supported by RFBR, research project No 17-06-00581\17.",,11,5,5,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,428,438,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300042,0

It also asks how earnings premiums and earnings penalties have changed for the nine ethnic minorities. For the analysis we use a subsample of the 2005 China's Inter-Census Survey. We find examples of three different changes over time in earnings premiums and earnings penalties: One ethnic minority for whom the development has been more favourable than for the Han majority; a second category in which development has been similar; and a third category for which development has been unfavourable. We conclude from the analysis that it can be misleading to infer the experience of one ethnic minority from that of another.","[Gustafsson, Bjorn] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Bjorn] Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Xiuna] China Dev Res Fdn, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Gustafsson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Gustafsson, B (通讯作者)，Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany.",Bjorn.Gustafsson@socwork.gu.se,,,China State Scholarship Council (CSC),China State Scholarship Council (CSC),"Much of Xiuna Yang's work was carried out when she was a visiting PhD student at the University of Gothenburg funded by a grant from the China State Scholarship Council (CSC).

Unit root tests, consistent momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) models and vector error correction models (asymmetric and symmetric) are employed to achieve research objectives. The results suggest that provincial wheat and flour markets may have a long-run relationship with principal market of Kabul. Afghan wheat and flour markets may also be cointegrated with their respective global, Kazakh and Pakistani markets. While provincial wheat markets might adjust to divergence from their long-run equilibrium with Kabul wheat market, some of the provincial flour markets may not respond to deviation from their long-run equilibrium with Kabul flour market. The speed of adjustment towards the long-run Afghan-Pakistani and Afghan-Kazakh equilibrium may be faster for Afghan flour than wheat markets. The equilibrium adjustment coefficients are generally small and market imperfections may exist, however. A shock in Kabul wheat and flour markets may have long-lasting effect on the respective provincial markets whereas a shock in global wheat and Pakistani, and Kazakh wheat and flour markets might have transitory effect on the corresponding Afghan markets.","[Hassanzoy, Najibullah] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fukuoka, Japan; [Ito, Shoichi; Isoda, Hiroshi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan; [Amekawa, Yuichiro] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Hassanzoy, N (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",hassanzoyn@gmail.com,,"Hassanzoy, Najibullah/0000-0002-1991-8466",Kyushu University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H04549] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Kyushu University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The journal submission fee for this work is paid by the Kyushu University.,,34,6,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This contribution primarily concentrates on a particular quantitative approach to measuring the systemic risk, which seems to be a significant risk in today's financial world (not solely in banks and insurance companies). The marginal expected shortfall measure is based on the well-known concept of the expected shortfall. More specifically, it can be regarded as a conditional version of the expected shortfall in which the global returns exceed a given market drop. We shall demonstrate that the marginal expected shortfall is a useful risk measure when studying the Prague Stock Exchange index and all its constituents. The corresponding modelling scheme is introduced and discussed. It is extended in such a way that one can describe time-varying dependencies using the multivariate GARCH modelling class. Moreover, such an econometric approach enables to forecast the capital shortfall over a potentially long period (e.g. a quarter or half year), which might be appreciated in financial and insurance practice.","[Hendrych, Radek; Cipra, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hendrych, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019; Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023","Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148",[GA P402/12/G097],,This work was supported by the grant GA P402/12/G097.,,12,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,459,468,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300045,0

A possibility, that we cannot prove or reject with the current specification of our models and available data, is that process innovation associated with product innovation raise marginal cost.

Efforts to mitigate these impacts have relied predominantly on the use of ramp rate restrictions, which limit the magnitude of hour-to-hour changes in reservoir discharge. Ramp rate restrictions shift hydropower production towards less valuable off-peak hours, imposing a financial penalty on dam owners that is a function of the spread (difference) between peak and off-peak electricity prices. This study examines how low natural gas prices in the U.S. have reduced the cost of implementing ramp rate restrictions at dams by narrowing the peak/off-peak price spread. Significantly lower costs of ramp rate restrictions could open new opportunities for improving environmental flows at dams, including the purchase of more natural streamflow patterns by downstream stakeholders, a type of arrangement for which there is growing precedent. We also explore the role that uncertainty in the cost of ramp rate restrictions could play in precluding downstream stakeholders from forming these types of agreements with dam owners. Results suggest that financial collar contracts could mostly eliminate inter-annual variability in the net cost of restrictions and provide those purchasing more natural flows with greater certainty.

Simulation results show that the Chinese will increase income after the formation of the RCEP. The increased income is partly attributed to rising investment income in the domestic market and partners' markets. Increased income, combined with reduction in commodity prices, results in higher consumption.

However, most GVCs-related literature about China focuses on country-to-country relations; less attention has been paid to China's domestic value chains (DVCs). GVCs should have their domestic foundations since strong linkages across domestic firms and regions can improve productivity through gains from specialization, which make domestic industries more competitive in GVCs in turn. This paper applies the so-called Trade in Value-added (TiVA) concept and the decomposition of domestic-regional trade in TiVA terms to re-measure the inter-industrial and interregional linkages in China's DVCs. We show that TiVA-based measures can significantly enrich our understanding on both the structure change of China's regional economy and the position and participation degree of Chinese regions in DVCs.","[Meng, Bo] IDE JETRO, Chiba, Japan; [Fang, Yong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jiemin] OECD, Stat Directorate STD, Paris, France; [Zhang, Yaxiong] China State Informat Ctr, Dept Econ Forecasting, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Fang, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fangyong@nju.edu.cn,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023; Meng, Bo/AAP-5042-2020","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518; Meng, Bo/0000-0003-1179-5390","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602800]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71573150, 71573062]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper was also supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No.2016YFA0602800) and the general project of Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71573150 and 71573062).,,36,37,40,10,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Specifically, the connections among daily and weekly growth rates of the 10-year government bond yields of the U.S., Germany and Greece from July 13, 2006 to January 29, 2016 are considered and an empirical illustration of those, based on the vector autoregressive (VAR) model with stochastic volatility (SV) disturbances, is provided. Finally, sufficient weak and strong exogeneity conditions in the VAR-SV models are tested. Our results indicate that during the time period covered by the analysis, the weekly growth rates of the 10-year U.S. bond yields were not affected by the past growth rates of the 10-year German and Greek bond yields. Contagion effects were absent among all the 10-year bond markets considered. From October 2008 to April 2015 a 'flight to quality' effect between Germany and Greece, as well as between the U.S. and Greece seems to have occurred. Since the strong exogeneity hypothesis of the 10-year US bond yields' weekly growth rates has not been rejected by the data, they can be predicted from the marginal model only, i.e. without taking the German and Greek bond yields into consideration.","[Modrzejewska, Anita] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Foreign Trade, Krakow, Poland; [Pajor, Anna] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Law, Dept Math, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Modrzejewska, A (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Econ & Int Relat, Dept Foreign Trade, Krakow, Poland.",,"Pajor, Anna/T-3865-2018","Pajor, Anna/0000-0001-5643-0649; Modrzejewska, Anita/0009-0006-4086-7452",Faculty of Finance and Law at Cracow University of Economics; STAIR PROJECT within ALTANTIS PROGRAMME - EU-US Cooperation in Higher Education and Training [2008-1747/001-001],Faculty of Finance and Law at Cracow University of Economics; STAIR PROJECT within ALTANTIS PROGRAMME - EU-US Cooperation in Higher Education and Training,"The initial version of this article came into being within the STAIR PROJECT Studies in Trans-Atlantic International Relations project no: 2008-1747/001-001 CPT-USTRAN realized within the ALTANTIS PROGRAMME - EU-US Cooperation in Higher Education and Training.

Because these profits are often hard to separate from other firm profits, patent boxes have been argued to be prone to tax shifting of firms, and tax competition between nations, as they might shift the location of the profits without affecting the location of R&D activities. Whether or not this occurs may also depend on conditions set in the patent box. We evaluate the innovation box policy instrument in the Netherlands, which is essentially a patent box, but without the formal requirement of a patent. We ask whether the innovation box has an effect on local R&D investment of the firm ('additionality'), thereby putting the hypothesis of tax shifting to the test. We find that the innovation box indeed has a positive effect on R&D investment, but the average firm that uses the policy tends to use only a part of the tax advantage for extra R&D investment.","[Mohnen, Pierre; Verspagen, Bart] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Mohnen, P (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Mohnen, P (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",p.mohnen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; vankan@dialogic.nl; verspagen@merit.unu.edu,"van Kan, Adrian/KCY-8056-2024; Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020; Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141; Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379",,,,,17,24,26,5,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The latter is nothing but a staff of employees safeguarding the main technology to guarantee the existence and development of the university education. Professional interests and professional motivation of the educating staff are going through deprivation tests thanks to constant administrative changes aimed at purely external forms of control.

The objective of this study is to analyze the relationships between the emissions caused by countries from a demand point of view, the carbon footprints and the demand for goods and services in these countries, and especially in the European countries. With this aim, a two-step process was carried out. Firstly, carbon footprints were calculated during the 1995-2009 period. Secondly, the EKC hypothesis between these carbon footprints and the total final demands were tested by using panel data and a multilevel mixed effects model. The results show that the EKC hypothesis is not supported when considering carbon footprints with respect to final demand. It is also shown that carbon footprints are slightly increasing with respect to final demand beyond proportionality. The carbon footprint elasticities are different between countries, their values increasing with the final demand per capita of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows during 2001-2013 that inefficiency peaked during the 2008 crisis period and has fallen back to levels close to pre-crisis periods. The model also performs well in out-of-sample forecasts of the financial firms' future market values. These results suggest that large financial firms have been adjusting to the new normal' of the post-crisis period and thus are able to use capital and labour more efficiently within the constraints of current market conditions. In addition, a non-linear pattern between inefficiency and a firm's asset size suggests that there might be an optimal scale for such firms in the $450-650 billion range.","[Pagano, Michael S.] Villanova Univ, Dept Finance, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Pagano, MS (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Finance, 800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",michael.pagano@villanova.edu,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We propose that ML models can be used as upper bounds for the explainable variance in a given data set and thus serve as upper bounds for the potential power of a theory. We demonstrate this method in the domain of uncertainty. We ask over 600 individuals to make a total of 6000 choices with randomized parameters and compare standard economic models to ML models. In the domain of risk, aversion of expected utility that allows for non-linear probability weighting (as in cumulative prospect theory) and individual-level parameters performs as well out-of sample as ML techniques. By contrast, in the domain of ambiguity, two of the most widely studied models (a linear version of maximin preferences and second order expected utility) fail to compete with the ML methods. We open the black boxes of the ML methods and show that under risk we rediscover expected utility with probability weighting. However, in the case of ambiguity the form of ambiguity aversion implied by our ML models suggests that there is gain from theoretical work on a portable model of ambiguity aversion. Our results highlight ways in which behavioral scientists can incorporate ML techniques in their daily practice to gain genuinely new insights. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the research concerning the development process at a regional level is an important task both form the academic point of view and from the perspective of socio-economic governance. In this regard, the aim of the article is to quantify the level of economic development in Poland at the voivodeships level (NUTS 2) for the years 2010-2014. The phenomenon of economic development is treated not only as a multivariate problem, but it is also assumed that it should be considered as a latent variable. Thus, in the research Structural Equation Model (SEM) was applied. SEM model is the result of a merger between confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis applied in econometrics.

The main aim of the paper is to analyse the existing quantitative approaches to regional development and development potential evaluation in European territory with a focus on usability of a method of spatial autocorrelation. The method of spatial autocorrelation is mostly used at the lower territorial level of NUTS 3 regions or municipalities. The method is employed to analyse the spatial differentiation not only economic but also a social phenomenon. Results of presented studies show the positive or negative spatial autocorrelation of selected economic or social variables based on the most commonly used of global spatial autocorrelation statistics - Moran's I coefficient. Currently, a majority of researchers improve the spatial autocorrelation knowledge by using of modified geographic weights matrix or by computation of the local spatial autocorrelation using the Local indicator of spatial association (LISA). Based on the conducted literature review, spatial autocorrelation can be considered as the suitable tool in regional development evaluation which helps to understand the spatial processes in the EU area.","[Polednikova, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Poledníková, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",eva.polednikova@vsb.cz,"Polednikova, Eva/J-5333-2018","Polednikova, Eva/0000-0001-8645-5716","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO [SP2017/111]; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]","SGS project of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness","The paper is supported by SGS project (SP2017/111) of Faculty of Economics, VSB-TUO and Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296).",,24,1,1,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,116,124,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500013,0

These models are rich enough to speak to first-order features of the data, such as many heterogeneous locations and gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting. At the same time, these models are sufficiently tractable to undertake realistic counterfactual exercises to study the effect of changes in amenities, productivity, and public policy interventions such as transport infrastructure investments.

Evidence from New York,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Criminal law; attorneys; efficiency wage; indigent defence; K14; J38; H42,,"Beginning 1 January 2004, the rates paid to assigned counsel - private attorneys who defend the indigent in criminal cases when a public defender does not - were raised from a maximum of $40 per hour to $75 per hour in the state of New York. This article examines the extent to which this relatively large pay increase affects case outcomes. Efficiency wage theory would suggest paying workers higher rates can improve their productivity, and the results of this analysis are consistent with this. Using a difference-in-difference approach, I find that after the assigned counsel rate increase, case outcomes significantly improved in counties with higher poverty rates relative to those with lower poverty rates. The likelihood of conviction and the likelihood of pleading guilty both fell by more than two percentage points in high-poverty counties compared to low-poverty counties after the rate increase, and the differences in the likelihood of being convicted are especially pronounced for cases involving violent felonies. The results suggest raising assigned counsel rates can be an effective policy tool to improve indigent defence systems that are in need of reform.","[Roach, Michael A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA",Middle Tennessee State University,"Roach, MA (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, MTSU Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA.",Michael.Roach@mtsu.edu,,,Middle Tennessee State University Faculty Research and Creative Activity Committee,Middle Tennessee State University Faculty Research and Creative Activity Committee,This work was supported by the Middle Tennessee State University Faculty Research and Creative Activity Committee.,,10,3,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In addition, our measure extends the classic by-production approach by including statistical aspects through subsampling techniques. We have also provided an algorithm to correct related infeasibilities. Using this approach, we investigate the performance of Iranian banks and credit risk management in the sector for the period 1998-2012. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have been used as an undesirable output and proxy for credit risk in our models. Based on our empirical results, although the banks generally exhibited efficiency improvements over time, their credit risk performance deteriorated considerably after the regulatory changes introduced in 2005. These findings confirm that credit quality can be monitored more actively across Iranian banks.","[Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia; [Arjomandi, Amir] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Dakpo, K.

The regression analysis of socioeconomic indicators from the Czech Republic in the long term (2000-2014) revealed that the demand-side theory and supply-side theory of nonprofit sustainability are mutually compatible and should not be confronted. The size of the Czech nonprofit sector is externally driven by the condition of economy (supply-side) as well as by the needs of socially vulnerable people (demand-side).

Previous studies treated FDI-immigration relationships as being independent of the modes of foreign market access. Using bilateral data of Japan and 28 other economies for the period 1996-2011, our analysis shows that FDI inflows become more dominant compared to imports when skilled immigration flows increase and less dominant when unskilled immigration flows increase. The results suggest that the relevant policy instruments as regards the promotion of trade, FDI and immigration should vary depending on economic goals, such as current account balances and labour shortages.","[Tomohara, Akinori] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Tomohara, Akinori] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Tomohara, Akinori] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan",Aoyama Gakuin University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tomohara, A (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Dept Int Econ, Shibuya Ku, Bldg 8 421,4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan.",jujodai@yahoo.com,,,Aoyama Gakuin University; [16K03650]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03650] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Aoyama Gakuin University; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the financial support from Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [No. 16K03650] and Aoyama Gakuin University.,,17,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The stock returns of 22 stock markets worldwide are analyzed to determine which region's EPU exhibits the greatest effect on regional systematic risk in the global stock market and on volatility risk in individual stock markets. First, all of the samples, the markets of different continents and the spillover indices of the developed and emerging markets, are calculated to observe the dynamic correlation among these markets with the aim of quantifying regional systematic risk and further examining the contagion risk effect of EPU. The results indicate the following: EPU in China is the most influential, and its contagion risk spreads to different regional markets, except for Europe; the effect of EPU in the United States is inferior to that in China; EPU in Japan merely influences contagion risk in emerging markets; contagion risk in European markets is not influenced by the four EPU indices; and EPU in Europe is not influenced by contagion risk in the global stock market. However, according to the volatility risk in each market, the EPU in Europe and China respectively influence Asian countries and European countries the most. These results may be attributable to the extremely high trade dependence among these countries because the performance of international enterprises is mainly determined by the economic policies of their trading partners.","[Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",,,,,21,129,133,9,78,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A child whose parents are both absent tends to have lower Chinese and mathematics test scores, lower self-assessment on his/ her behavior, and is less likely to be happy and satisfied.

The first case focuses on providing services to women and shows a hybrid model would have selected the top three signature' projects and maintained an above-average overall project benefit while securing a 180% improvement in the number of projects funded, a 66% improvement in the number of women served and a 132% improvement in the total benefit achieved. In the second case, we apply the hybrid approach to data from the US government's largest forest preservation programme and demonstrate that the hybrid approach could allow the programme to select up to 11 top-scoring projects while still achieving a 97% gain in the total overall benefit compared to their traditional method. These case studies show that the hybrid approach has the potential to be applied in a variety of settings and improve how foundations and programmes achieve their goals.","[Wu, Shang; Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Toussaint, Jenna] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,National Science Foundation EPSCoR [1301765],National Science Foundation EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation EPSCoR under Grant number 1301765.,,25,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The first one considers an acceptable percentage of changes in resources to ensure practical feasibility. The second one further considers a situation where resources can only be allowed to shift within specific units. The proposed models are applied to an empirical study based on a hospital system in Taiwan. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of the suggested plans, we compare our reallocation suggestions to a plan that can make the whole system be perfectly efficient. The main conclusion is that the plans derived from our models are more practically feasible than that with perfect efficiency.","[Yang, Chih-Ching] Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt Management, Taichung, Taiwan",Central Taiwan University Science & Technology,"Yang, CC (通讯作者)，Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",107103@ctust.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-166-002],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 104-2410-H-166-002.].,,30,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article makes the first attempt in the real estate literature to employ intraday data for volatility forecasting. We examine a wide range of commonly used methods and apply them to several major global REIT markets. Our findings suggest that the group of reduced form methods deliver the most accurate one-step-ahead forecast for daily REIT volatility. They outperform their GARCH-model-based counterparts and two methods using low-frequency data. We also show that exploiting intraday information through GARCH does not necessarily yield incremental precision for forecasting REIT volatility. Our results are relatively robust to the choice of realized measure of volatility and the length of evaluation period.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Real Estate & Housing,50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Real Estate & Housing,50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,45,8,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is sometimes natural to think of asymmetric information as emerging from imperfect observation of previously taken actions (e.g., obtaining compliments or substitutes for the item being bargained over). How do such strategic investment choices prior to bargaining interact with the strategic problem of bargaining under private information? We focus on bilateral bargaining when players can make unobserved investments in the value of the item prior to their interaction. With two-sided hidden investment, strategic uncertainty induces a post-investment problem analogous to that in Myerson and Satterthwaite (J Econ Theory 29(2):265-281, 1983), and inefficiencies might be expected to arise. But, there are strong incentives to avoid investment levels that do not lead to trade and this must be anticipated by the other trader. This effect is shown to drive a form of unraveling; as a result in every equilibrium to the larger game the good ends up in the hands of the agent with the higher valuation.","[Akcay, Erol] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, 433 S Univ Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Meirowitz, Adam] Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, Dept Finance, 1655 Campus Ctr Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Ramsay, Kristopher W.] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Corwin 038, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Princeton University,"Meirowitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, David Eccles Sch Business, Dept Finance, 1655 Campus Ctr Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",eakcay@sas.upenn.edu; adam.meirowitz@eccles.utah.edu; kramsay@princeton.edu,"Akcay, Erol/G-3167-2011",,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

In this context, the work of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been central in reforming the international tax system. This paper is based on the keynote address delivered to the 2017 International Institute of Public Finance Annual Congress on 18 August 2017 in Tokyo by David Bradbury of the OECD, and highlights the OECD's global tax agenda and how it can advance inclusive fiscal reform. The paper covers three major areas of the OECD's work. First, it reviews the advances made by the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project to reduce BEPS, and the ongoing work to address the tax challenges of digitalisation. Second, it reviews the initiatives involving the exchange of taxpayer information, and the development of new standards on Automatic Exchange of Information and Exchange of Information on Request by the OECD. Finally, the paper considers how these international initiatives provide policymakers with more domestic tax policy options and recommendations on how tax systems can be better designed to achieve inclusive growth.","[Bradbury, David; O'Reilly, Pierce] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Ctr Tax Policy & Adm, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Bradbury, D (通讯作者)，Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Ctr Tax Policy & Adm, Paris, France.",David.Bradbury@oecd.org,,,,,,,13,3,3,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Interestingly, we find that, during the Dot-com bubble from 1997 to 2001, the MPU would positively cause AUR. The reason behind is that increasing MPUs due to the speculations on Dot-com firms provide favourable opportunities to investors. In contrast, we find negative prediction from MPU to AUR for a few months after the European debt crisis in late 2009. Besides, unidirectional causality running from AUR to MPU is detected only for the period of Dot-com bubble. For New Zealand, we find unidirectional causality running from MPU to NZR in a few months in 2010 with negative impacts. Policy authorities should realise the heterogeneous impacts from MPU on stock returns in Australia and New Zealand. In the end, no evidence supports the predictions from MPU to stock returns for both countries after 2013 though sensitive events such as Taper Tantrum, Liftoff, Brexit and US election frequently occur in recent years. Except for the global financial messy or speculations, the MPU is less likely to take a toll on the stock market in Australia and New Zealand.","[Cai, Yifei] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Cai, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",yifei.cai@research.uwa.edu.au,"Jiang, Yushi/GPL-6078-2022","Cai, Yifei/0000-0002-4389-2948",University Postgraduate Award (UPA) at The University of Western Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (RTP) at The University of Western Australia,University Postgraduate Award (UPA) at The University of Western Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (RTP) at The University of Western Australia,"I thank two anonymous referees for helpful comments on this paper.

Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid up front, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just 1 month later increases demand by 21 percentage points.","[Casaburi, Lorenzo] Univ Zurich, Schonberggasse 1, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Willis, Jack] Columbia Univ, 1022 IAB,420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Zurich; Columbia University,"Casaburi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Schonberggasse 1, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",lorenzo.casaburi@econ.uzh.ch; jw3634@columbia.edu,"Casaburi, Lorenzo/AAM-7956-2020","Casaburi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-7752-1125",SIEPR; USAID BASIS,SIEPR; USAID BASIS(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"We wish to thank the anonymous referees, as well as Vojta Bartos, Emily Breza, John Campbell, Michael Carter, Shawn Cole, Brian Dillon, David Dorn, Pascaline Dupas, Ram Fishman, Siddharth George, Ed Glaeser, Oliver Hart, Nathan Hendren, Cynthia Kinnan, Michael Kremer, David Laibson, Guilherme Lichand, Craig McIntosh, Mushfiq Mobarak, Sendhil Mullainathan, Nathan Nunn, Matthew Rabin, Gautam Rao, Martin Rotemberg, Frank Schilbach, Andrei Shleifer, Tavneet Suri, Alessandro Tarozzi, Argyris Tsiaras, Chris Udry, Eric Verhoogen, Andrew Weiss, and seminar audiences at ABCA conference, BASIS Technical Meeting, Barcelona Summer Forum, BREAD pre-conference, Cambridge, Columbia, Cornell (Dyson), CREST, CSAE Oxford conference, DIAL conference, ECBE conference, Harvard, IGC International Growth Week, IIES, INSEAD, Lindau meetings, NBER/BREAD development meeting, NBER insurance meeting, NEUDC conference, NOVAFRICA conference, PACDEV conference, PSE, Princeton, Sciences Po, Stanford, TSE, UCL, and UCSD for useful comments.

This paper sets out to examine why East and Southeast Asian citizens do not prefer social equality despite exacerbating income inequality, yet limited welfare spending. Unlike previous studies, which highlight substantive human rights and praise Asian values for its virtue of East and Southeast Asian welfare states, I argue that the Asian traditional beliefs of self-determination, self-reliance, and filial duty constrain citizens' demand for and supply of welfare services, thus reducing their support for social equality. I then test these hypotheses against the Asian Barometer Survey data. The statistical results support my assertions, suggesting that strong Asian values lessen the preference for social equality, and that income inequality does not stimulate the demand for redistributive policies in East and Southeast Asian authoritarian countries.","[Chang, Alex Chuan-hsien] Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, 128 Acad Rd Sec 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chang, ACH (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Polit Sci, 128 Acad Rd Sec 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",chang626@gate.sinica.edu.tw,"Lai, Melody/D-4569-2011",,,,,,96,7,7,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

In particular, we propose a framework for analyzing the tension between static efficiency (pricing behavior) and dynamic efficiency (investment behavior). The investment behavior is rendered endogenous by means of a dynamic model where the current investment depends on the expected future profits. We then use a forward simulation procedure to analyze the effect of an open-access market structure where a new firm uses the network of one of the biggest railroad firm. Under a simple access charge equaled to the marginal cost of access, investment in network infrastructure decreases by 10% per year, leading to a significant decrease in network quality over time. Under this setting, despite the increase of price competition, the decrease in network quality leads to a fall in consumer welfare. Other types of (more evolved) access charges might even allow to relax the tension between static efficiency and dynamic efficiency, allowing more price competition while preserving investment incentives. This topic deserves further research and is beyond the scope of this paper.","[Ivaldi, Marc] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Coublucq, Daniel] Compass Lexecon, Brussels, Belgium; [McCullough, Gerard] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",marc.ivaldi@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

This paper investigates to what extent the diffusion of mobile broadband has impacted economic development in terms of GDP. The study is based on data for 135 countries (90 countries once controlling for capital, employment and human capital) for the period 2002-2014. The results show that there is a statistically significant effect from mobile broadband on GDP both when mobile broadband is first introduced and gradually as mobile broadband diffuses throughout different economies. Based on a two stage model we are able to conclude that on average a 10 percent increase of mobile broadband adoption causes a 0.8 percent increase in GDP. Moreover, once we control for the years since mobile broadband was introduced, we find that the economic effect gradually decreases over time. For the country with median average growth of mobile broadband penetration, this implies that the economic effect has disappeared 6 years after introduction (if introduction is defined as a mobile penetration of 1 percent).

We answer this question by empirically examining the effects of US public attention to Islamic terrorism on returns of US Islamic and conventional indices between 2004 and 2017. US public attention to Islamic terrorism is measured using Google Search Volume, which reflects active public attentiveness, and media coverage, which measures passive attentiveness. We test its effect on the stock returns of Islamic and conventional indices by using difference-in-difference analysis. The results indicate that US public attention to Islamic terrorism negatively affects US Islamic indices, suggesting that investors may make amalgams between terrorism and Islamic finance. These cliches may lead them to sell Sharia-compliant assets when US public attention to Islamic terrorism is high.

Using time use data and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions, we find that rising women's employment and observed wages together account for about 60% of the fall in the time married women spent cooking. We then use a semi-parametric matching technique to construct an implicit wage rate, which better reflects the change in labour-market incentives that individuals face. The rise in women's implicit wages explains no more than 20% of the decline in their cooking time, while the wage of their partner has no effect. Changing labour-market incentives are thus far from being the main driver of the decline in home-cooking. We also find evidence that home cooking continues to be structured by the gendered social norm of the proper family meal.","[Etile, Fabrice] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Etile, Fabrice; Plessz, Marie] INRA, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Plessz, Marie] PSL Res Univ, CNRS, Ctr Maurice Halbwachs, EHESS,ENS, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; INRAE; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Etilé, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.;Etilé, F (通讯作者)，INRA, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",fabrice.etile@psemail.eu,"Etile, Fabrice/AAA-9193-2022","Etile, Fabrice/0000-0003-3388-5848; Plessz, Marie/0000-0001-7026-6224",Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique's Metaprogram DID'IT,Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique's Metaprogram DID'IT,"We would like to thank the referees and editors for their comments and suggestions, Andrew Clark and seminar participants at Monash University (Centre for Health Economics), Toulouse School of Economics (Food policy seminar), Oxford (Worshop on time use surveys) and the INRA-DID'IT annual workshop.

We find that exchange rate flexibility negatively affects economic growth, but this effect varies with the degree of financial market openness. Countries with high financial market openness benefit from maintaining high exchange rate flexibility, whereas the opposite is true for countries with low financial market openness. This empirical result implies that policymakers should consider the long-term growth effect when formulating exchange rate policy as it could be a useful policy option for emerging markets with limited policy independence. This is particularly relevant to policy coordination since greater exchange rate flexibility alone cannot solve the global imbalance.","[Lee, Il Houng] Bank Korea BOK, Monetary Policy Board, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 04531, South Korea; [Kim, Kyunghun] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy KIEP, Bldg C,Sejong Natl Res Complex,370 Sicheongdaero, Sejong Si 30147, South Korea",Bank of Korea; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Lee, IH (通讯作者)，Bank Korea BOK, Monetary Policy Board, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 04531, South Korea.",ilhoung@bok.or.kr; khkim@kiep.go.kr,,,,,,,32,4,4,6,111,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Phillips (1991) demonstrated the higher-order asymptotic expansions for LAD estimators. Rilstone et al. (1996) provided the second-order bias results of conditional mean regression estimators. This paper develops new analytical results on the second-order bias of the conditional quantile regression estimators, which enables an improved bias correction and thus to obtain improved quantile estimation. In particular, we show that the second-order bias is larger towards the tails of the conditional density than near the median, and therefore the benefit of the second-order bias correction is greater when we are interested in the deeper tail quantiles, e.g., for the study of income distribution and financial risk management. The Monte Carlo simulation confirms the theory that the bias is larger at the tail quantiles, and the second-order bias correction improves the behavior of the quantile estimators.

Policymakers and researchers worry about the process of assimilation of the new entrants, in a country where regional disparities are strong. We provide evidence that regional income disparities apply to groups of immigrants as well as of nationals, but the most important source of inequality rests on within-immigrant group/within-region, especially for those households with the presence of women and very young children. However, if bottom incomes were to grow, inequality would not diminish, with the exception of married individuals living in the North, for no other characteristic is correlated to inequality according to the Atkinson bottom sensitive index. We show that the uneven economic development across regions then influences the distribution of immigration both in sociodemographic and economic terms.","[Mussida, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Parisi, Maria Laura] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Brescia,"Mussida, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",chiara.mussida@unicatt.it; marialaura.parisi@unibs.it,"Parisi, Maria Laura/H-9904-2014","Parisi, Maria Laura/0000-0002-7072-3664","Fondazione Eulo, Brescia","Fondazione Eulo, Brescia","We wish to thank the Editor-in-Chief Frank Cowell and two anonymous referees for their detailed and helpful comments.

We develop a small open economy model of endogenous growth where public spending can be financed by borrowing on imperfect international financial markets, where the country's borrowing capacity is limited. In contrast to the existing literature, which assumes that debt is constrained by the stock of capital, we investigate the consequences of gross domestic product (GDP)-based collaterals. First, we demonstrate that the economy may converge in a finite time, which is determined endogenously, to the regime with binding collaterals. Second, in such regime the steady-state public expenditures-to-GDP ratio is greater than that of the existing literature's models. Finally, we show that the degree of financial openness rises welfare if the collateral constraint is nonbinding and reduces welfare if the constraint binds. The first effect prevails always over the second and total intertemporal welfare increases.","[Onori, Daria] Univ Orleans, Orleans, France",Universite de Orleans,"Onori, D (通讯作者)，Fac Droit Econ & Gest, Lab Econ Orleans, Rue Blois,BP 26739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France.",daria.onori@univ-orleans.fr,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

To this end, it first introduces the various dimensions of wage, income, consumption and wealth inequality, and studies how they have developed. The analysis shows less wage dispersion in Spain than in other comparable economies, even after the crisis years, while the surge in unemployment during the period resulted in a high level of inequality in per capita income. The level of inequality in Spain is more moderate when total gross household income is analysed, decreasing during the crisis as a result of pensions developing more favourably than other sources of income, in conjunction with young people delaying setting up home. Inequality in per capita consumption rose during the crisis, particularly as a result of a decrease in expenditure on consumer durables by low-income households. Wealth inequality exceeds income inequality and increased during the downturn as a result of financial assets outperforming real assets. Nevertheless, Spain's wealth inequality is moderate by international standards, as ownership of real assets is more widespread than in other countries. The way inequality has evolved during the early stages of the current economic recovery shows that falling unemployment has enabled a reduction in wage income inequality, as well as in per capita income inequality, albeit to a lesser extent.","[Anghel, Brindusa; Basso, Henrique; Bover, Olympia; Maria Casado, Jose; Hospido, Laura; Izquierdo, Mario; Kataryniuk, Ivan A.; Lacuesta, Aitor; Manuel Montero, Jose; Vozmediano, Elena] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Bover, O (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain.",bover@bde.es,"Anghel, Brindusa/JXR-7658-2024; Kataryniuk, Ivan/AAK-1988-2021","Kataryniuk, Ivan/0000-0002-9423-2747; Lacuesta, Aitor/0000-0002-7050-8462",,,,,41,28,31,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Estimating the Uber effect,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Platform technology; Gig economy; Competition; Technological change; Uber,LABOR; DEREGULATION; TECHNOLOGY; COMPUTER; TAXI,"A frequent belief is that the rise of so-called gig work has led to the displacement of workers in a wide range of traditional jobs. This paper examines the impacts of the flagship of the gig economy Uber on workers employed in conventional taxi services. Our analysis exploits newly collected data on the staggered rollout of Uber across metropolitan areas in the United States and a difference-in-differences design to document that incumbent taxi drivers experienced a relative earnings decline of about 10 percent subsequent to Uber's entry into a new market, while there are no significant effects on their labor supply. Additional evidence from a battery of placebo tests, event study estimates, and specifications using Google Trends data to capture differences in treatment intensity underlines these findings. A triple-differences design that compares changes among taxi drivers relative to bus, tractor, and truck drivers that were unaffected by the arrival of Uber, provides further supporting evidence that the diffusion of Uber has reduced the earnings potential of incumbent drivers in conventional taxi services in the United States.

Using a nine-year panel data of about 120 countries from the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Reports, results suggest that overall ease of doing business has a positive effect on business creation. This relationship is most strongly driven by the Starting a Business component, but Paying Taxes is also important. In addition, the effect of the Starting a Business component is driven by the financial cost rather than the time and administrative cost.

The novel approach adopted here is to utilise its predictive ability for the whole distribution of future growth, rather than predicting the center of this distribution directly. Our results confirm previous findings that the yield spread does contain additional information about the future GDP growth, which varies over time. Most importantly, utilising the information contained in the whole conditional distribution of predicted GDP growth, rather than concentrating on the center of it, provides additional forecasting power for shorter (3-9 months) horizons. This approach is also superior in forecasting future expansionary phases, notably a more common phenomenon than recessions for which the traditional, OLS-based forecasts seem to perform better.","[Gebka, Bartosz] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Mammel Hall 332S, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of Nebraska System; Loughborough University,"Gebka, B (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",bartosz.gebka@ncl.ac.uk; mwohar@mail.unomaha.edu,"Gebka, Bartosz/I-5189-2019","Gebka, Bartosz/0000-0003-4510-0374; Wohar, Mark/0000-0002-4967-0609",,,,,60,5,7,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The analysis extends the classic dual margins to three dimensions: destination extensive, destination intensive and destination structural margins. The paper suggests that connecting to the internet not only raises Chinese firms' propensity to export, but also extends the destination extensive margin. In addition, Internet Plus could create a synergistic effect for internet-enabled enterprises, that is, the development of the destination country's internet access benefits domestic firms' export participation. Finally, the paper finds that Internet Plus, rather than increasing the intensive or structural margins, leads to the transfer of exports to lower-middle-income countries and helps firms achieve competitiveness and thus increases their profit. The paper provides an explanatory mechanism and empirical evidence for firms' use of the internet to optimize export space.","[Huang, Xianhai; Song, Xueyin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xinyue] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Hangzhou Dianzi University,"Song, XY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hxhhz@126.com; xueyin.song@zju.edu.cn; nicolezju@126.com,,"Huang, Xianhai/0000-0002-0766-581X","Key Project of Zhejiang Province Social Science Plan [18NDJC001Z]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M621898, 2018T110580]; Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDB156]; Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71433002]; Zhejiang University REOD [201801]",Key Project of Zhejiang Province Social Science Plan; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang University REOD,"Xianhai Huang, Professor, School of Economics, Zhejiang University, China.

The main challenge is that the aggregate state vector contains the distribution of agents, which is typically infinite-dimensional. I approximate the distribution with a flexible parametric family, reducing its dimensionality to a finite set of endogenous parameters, and solve for the dynamics of these endogenous parameters by perturbation. I implement the method in Dynare and show that it is fast, general, and easy to use. As an illustration, I use the method to perform a Bayesian estimation of a heterogeneous firm model with aggregate shocks to neutral and investment-specific productivity. I find that the behavior of investment at the firm level quantitatively shapes inference about the aggregate shock processes, suggesting an important role for micro data in estimating DSGE models.","[Winberry, Thomas] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Winberry, Thomas] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Winberry, T (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Winberry, T (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Thomas.Winberry@chicagobooth.edu,,,,,,,35,21,33,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Empirical findings suggest that military spending is determined by economic, strategic, political, and security factors. Studies that estimate demand functions for such budgetary outlays focus either on individual country case studies or on groups of countries that share some similar traits and characteristics or belong to the same geopolitical region. This paper, using a panel of 12 Latin American countries and quantile regression analysis, estimates the demand for military expenditure over the 1965-2015 period. Results reported herein indicate that such spending has been driven by both domestic and external factors. The former include the economy as well as the political characteristics of the government as these are quantified by the Polity index of democracy. Intrastate conflict that has plagued many Latin American countries also emerges as a strong driving force in the allocation of resources to defence. Military spending by neighbouring countries with common borders emerges as the external strategic determinant that affects the demand for defence expenditures.","[Kollias, Christos; Tzeremes, Panayiotis; Tzeremes, Nickolaos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Econ Policy & Strateg Planning, Volos, Greece; [Paleologou, Suzanna Maria] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Thessaly; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Kollias, C (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Econ Policy & Strateg Planning, Volos, Greece.",kollias@uth.gr,"Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./AAF-6971-2020; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./AAX-5079-2020; Tzeremes, Panayiotis G/B-2886-2019","Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./0000-0002-6938-3404; Tzeremes, Panayiotis G/0000-0002-0746-3839",,,,,61,10,11,1,4,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

We find that the winners of these randomly assigned initial public offering (IPO) lottery shares are significantly more likely to hold them than lottery losers 1, 6, and even 24 months after the random allocation. This finding strongly evokes laboratory findings of an endowment effect for risky gambles, and persists in samples of highly active investors, suggesting along with additional evidence that this behaviour is not driven by inertia alone. The effect decreases as experience in the IPO market increases, but remains even for very experienced investors.

A semi-parametric approach with Cornish-Fisher expansion, which approximates the quantile using the higher moments of the distribution, is provided to estimate hedging ratios using CVaR as risk objective function. The approach can successfully capture the features of higher moments with the heavy-tailed and higher kurtosis distribution of the EUA returns which tends to be neglected. The hedging performances of Minimum-CVaR model we proposed and the conventional Minimum-Variance model are evaluated and compared. Our empirical results show that Minimum-CVaR hedging strategy generally outperforms the other in-sample using all the effectiveness criteria while it is not consistent out-of-sample. The proposed semi-parametric Minimum-CVaR strategy with Cornish-Fisher expansion is advisable in carbon market hedging problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We designed classroom experiments whereby students had to decide on whether to commit to their ex ante level of effort despite that they have no interest to do so ex post. The experiment consisted of three within-subject treatments that define different institutional contexts regarding information disclosure, evoking different levels of social visibility and commitment. In contrast to the theoretical predictions, a significant percentage of students tend to stand by their ex ante commitments regardless of the manipulation of the social context. Our findings corroborate the existence of a freezing effect by showing that promise keeping is sensitive to our manipulation of social visibility and self-commitment, with a stronger effect for public disclosure of the average level of effort than for public self-announcement of private choices. Our data also allows us to shed light on promise making behaviour. Contrary to promise keeping, there are order effects. However, the number of observations is too small to identify a difference between the baseline treatment and the one implying public self-announcement of level of effort.","[Festre, Agnes] CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06905 Sophia Antipolis, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Festré, A (通讯作者)，CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06905 Sophia Antipolis, France.",festre@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,29,1,1,1,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We show that every utility representation for a monotonic preference is equal to the minmax value of a decision maker whose payoff depends on the option chosen from the menu and on the realization of a subjective state. This representation suggests a decision maker who faces uncertainty about her own future tastes and who exhibits an extreme form of pessimism with respect to this uncertainty. In the case of finitely many alternatives, we provide a characterization of monotonic preferences which relaxes the sub-modularity axiom of Kreps (1979). We characterize the minimal state space needed for our representation, and we show that the second-period choice behavior of our decision maker differs from the one implied by the costly contemplation model of Ergin (2003).

We argue that price paths serve as graphical frames that influence the perceived attractiveness of an asset by highlighting specific asset characteristics. In a controlled lab experiment we find that price paths have an impact on investment decisions. In a regression we test a simple model relating the perception of price path shapes to several heuristics. These heuristics are: focusing on more recent outcomes, deriving implicit reference prices from focal prices, focusing on losses, and estimating risk from the amplitude of the path. We conclude that investment decisions are systematically biased due to the shape of an asset's price path. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Under optimal monetary and fiscal policy, comprising a de facto inflation stabilization policy, the tax rate as an optimal fiscal policy tool plays an important role in stabilizing inflation, although not completely because of the distorted steady state.

We use a two-stage stochastic planning model with recourse or corrective investment options to find optimal portfolios of infrastructure both under perfect information and uncertainty. Under a series of assumptions, this model is equivalent to the equilibrium of a much more complicated bi-level market model, where a transmission planner chooses investments first and generation firms invest afterwards. We find that optimal investment strategies present important differences depending on the policy scenario. By changing our assumption of how agents will react to this uncertainty we compute bounds on the cost that this uncertainty imposes on the system, which we estimate ranges between 3.2% and 5.7% of the minimum expected system cost of $57.6B depending on whether agents will consider or not uncertainty when choosing investments. We also find that, if agents choose investments using a stochastic planning model, uncertain climate policies can result in nearly 18% more CO2 emissions than the equilibrium levels observed under perfect information. Our results highlight the importance of credible and stable long-term regulations for investors in the electric power industry if the goal is to achieve climate and environmental targets in the most cost-effective manner and to minimize the risk of asset stranding.

Keeping higher levels of reserves provides a hedge against rollover risk, but this is costly because using reserves to pay down debt allows the government to reduce sovereign spreads. Our model, parameterized to mimic salient features of a typical emerging economy, can account for significant holdings of international reserves, and the larger accumulation of both debt and reserves in periods of low spreads and high income. We also show that income windfalls, improved policy frameworks, and an increase in the importance of rollover risk imply increases in the optimal holdings of reserves that are consistent with the upward trend in reserves in emerging economies. It is essential for our results that debt maturity exceeds one period.","[Bianchi, Javier] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, 90 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Bianchi, Javier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hatchondo, Juan Carlos] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Hatchondo, Juan Carlos] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; [Martinez, Leonardo] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; National Bureau of Economic Research; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Western University (University of Western Ontario); International Monetary Fund,"Bianchi, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, 90 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.;Bianchi, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",javierIbianchi@gmail.com; juanc.hatchondo@gmail.com; leo14627@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,57,71,3,35,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

High-speed Internet promotes the use of electronic devices, video games and Internet addiction (e.g., online games and cyberloafing). Exposure to artificial light from tablets and PCs can alterate individuals' sleep patterns. However, there is little empirical evidence on the causal relationship between technology use near bedtime and sleep. This paper studies the causal effects of access to high-speed Internet on sleep. We first show that playing video games, using PC or smartphones, watching TV or movies are correlated with shorter sleep duration. Second, we exploit historical differences in pre-existing telephone infrastructure that affected the deployment of high-speed Internet across Germany (see Falck et al., 2014) to identify a source of plausibly exogenous variation in access to Broadband. Using this instrumental variable strategy, we find that access to high-speed Internet (DSL) access reduces sleep duration and sleep satisfaction. Results are driven by individuals who face work or family time constraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a first step, we estimate sibling correlations and find a substantial influence of shared family and community background on all outcomes. To further disentangle the influence of family background and neighborhood, we estimate neighbor correlations. Our results show that for all outcomes, the estimated neighbor correlations are clearly lower than the estimated sibling correlations. However, especially for cognitive skills and mental health, neighbor correlations are still substantial in relation to sibling correlations. Thus, compared to existing results from other countries, the influence of the neighborhood on these outcomes is not negligible in Germany.","[Buegelmayer, Elisabeth; Schnitzlein, Daniel D.] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Schnitzlein, Daniel D.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Labour Econ, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Leibniz University Hannover,"Schnitzlein, DD (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Schnitzlein, DD (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Labour Econ, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",ebuegelmayer@diw.de; schnitzlein@aoek.uni-hannover.de,,,"Leibniz Association, Bonn","Leibniz Association, Bonn","We thank two anonymous referees, Karin Hederos Eriksson and participants of ESPE 2014, EALE 2014, SES 2015, workshop participants at RWI Essen, and seminar participants at IAB Nuremberg for helpful comments and suggestions.

While the literatures on spatial variation and temporal movement in prices have grown in parallel, this study marks a departure by providing a unified treatment and proposing a comprehensive framework that allows both approaches. The proposed model is based on twin extensions of the household version of the country product dummy model by allowing for a dynamic stochastic specification and interdependence of spatial prices of geographically adjacent regions. Tests of temporal stability and regional independence of the estimated spatial prices are proposed and applied in this paper. The paper shows that the introduction of an autoregressive error process of order one, AR(1), improves the efficiency of the estimates of parameters, urban-rural and temporal price indices under certain conditions. The Indian application points to a rich potential for using the proposed framework in cross country comparisons such as the International Comparison Program (ICP) exercises.","[Chakrabarty, Manisha] Indian Inst Management Calcutta, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Majumder, Amita] Indian Stat Inst, Kolkata, India; [Ray, Ranjan] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Calcutta; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; Monash University,"Majumder, A (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, India.",amita@isical.ac.in,,"Ray, Ranjan/0000-0002-0411-6268",,,,,43,4,6,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Using Chinese customs transactions between 2000 and 2009, we exploit time-variation in product-level trade policy and find that Chinese firms are less likely to enter new foreign markets and more likely to exit from established foreign markets when their products are subject to increased trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis is based on the phenomenon of tariff echoing - after a tariff hike in one country, another country is likely to raise its tariff on the same product. Overall, we find that if there had been no trade policy uncertainty created by the use of contingent tariffs, Chinese entry into foreign markets would have been roughly 2% higher per year. We use our model to counterfactually estimate how much entry by Chinese firms over 2001-2009 was due to future trade policy certainty provided by membership in the WTO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of three policy options, such as an increase in co-payments, an earlier starting age of contribution, and more distribution of the cost to the public sector, is also examined. The numerical results show that in the next about forty years the burdens on the first (age 65 and over) and second (age 40 to 64) groups become more than 1.7 times and more than 2.7 times as much, respectively. A relatively more increase in the burdens on the second group cannot be avoidable, even if adjustment of the cost distribution between both groups is made every three years in the future in accordance with the schedule by the MHLW. Furthermore, in order to reduce future burdens in the LTCI, an increase in co-payments is most preferable, rather than an earlier starting age of contribution in the longer duration with lower annual burdens, or a shift of the cost to the public sector with a very high consumption tax.

We provide a complete characterization of equilibrium outcomes for regular environments by relying on techniques developed elsewhere for aggregate games and for the mechanism design delegation literature. The set of equilibria includes those with nondifferentiable payoffs and discontinuous choices, as well as equilibria that are smooth and continuous in types. We identify one equilibrium, the maximal equilibrium, which is the unique solution to a self-generating optimization program with the largest (or maximal) domain, and the only equilibrium that is supported with biconjugate (i.e., least-concave) tariffs. The maximal equilibrium exhibits a n-fold distortion caused by each of the n principal's non-cooperative behavior in overharvesting the agent's information rent. Furthermore, in any equilibrium, over any interval of types in which there is full separation, the agent's equilibrium action corresponds to the allocation in the maximal equilibrium. Under reasonable conditions, the maximal equilibrium maximizes the agent's information rent within the class of equilibrium allocations. When the principals' most-preferred equilibrium allocation differs from the maximal equilibrium, we demonstrate that the agent's choice function exhibits an interval of bunching over the worst agent types, and elsewhere corresponds to the maximal allocation. The optimal region of bunching trades off the principals' desire to constrain inefficient n-fold marginalizations of the agent's rent against the inefficiency of pooling agent types.","[Martimort, David] Paris Sch Econ, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France; [Semenov, Aggey] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Stole, Lars A.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Paris School of Economics; University of Ottawa; University of Chicago,"Martimort, D (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France.",david.martimort@psemail.eu; aggey.semenov@uottawa.ca; lars.stole@chicagobooth.edu,,"Simons, Aggey/0000-0002-0350-9027",,,,,30,2,2,0,1,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

This paper presents evidence against such a belief in the East Asian context by classifying finely disaggregated trade data based on the stages of the production process. The trade slowdown was attributed mainly to sluggishness of trade in primary goods and processed raw materials. In contrast, East Asian trade in manufactured parts and components and the assembled end-products within production networks continued to expand steadily.","[Obashi, Ayako] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Int Polit Econ & Commun, Shibuya Ku, 4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan; [Kimura, Fukunari] Keio Univ, Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Kimura, Fukunari] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Aoyama Gakuin University; Keio University; Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; Keio University,"Obashi, A (通讯作者)，Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Int Polit Econ & Commun, Shibuya Ku, 4-4-25 Shibuya, Tokyo 1508366, Japan.",obashi@sipeb.aoyama.ac.jp; fkimura@econ.keio.ac.jp,"Kimura, Fukunari/AAX-8044-2021","Obashi, Ayako/0000-0002-6161-7755",,,,,9,10,10,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

A questionnaire with a multiple-bounded discrete choice format was designed and 555 valid samples were gathered in this analysis. On average, companies are willing to pay 8.3% more on energy costs, while those participating in pilot trading schemes are willing to pay 10.2% more. Pilot companies also have higher investment in energy-saving technology, better awareness of both carbon mitigation technology and carbon policy, and clearer expectations of the national carbon market. The regression analysis shows that the willingness to pay (WTP) is influenced by several factors. The perception of the high pressure of energy costs will significantly decrease the WTP of the non-pilot companies. If a pilot company presumes that it will participate in the national trading schemes sooner, its willingness to pay will be higher. Participation or not in pilot trading schemes exerts an effect on companies' WTP because of two factors: awareness of carbon mitigation technology and the reduction ratio expected by the companies. Among all manufacturing sectors, companies involved in the non-ferrous, chemical, paper-making and iron and steel sectors can be brought into the national carbon market as priority participants, because they have a higher WTP for carbon emissions, or they have a shorter time expectation for participating in the national carbon market.

Finally, a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) was used to analyze the driving factors of changes in China's regional ECEs. The results indicate that: (1) China's regional ECEs have increased by 197%, from 518 Mt in 2002 to 1537 Mt in 2012; (2) ECEs have mainly transferred from less developed regions like northwest to developed regions like east coast through carbon-intensive manufacturing industries, testifying that pollution heaven hypothesis did work in China to some extent; (3) inter-regional trade scale growth was the dominant factor in increasing regional ECEs, while technological progress in exporting regions played a key restraining role.

However, recent surveys highlight the growing tendency by younger generations to change drinking-style. This increases the concern over adoption of unhealthy consumption behaviours that might be carried over in later age. What remains unexplored are the details of these emerging consumption patterns. The objective of this paper is to cast some light on these phenomena using stated choice data. This study quantitatively explores consumption contexts and links them to characteristics of young Italians. Data collected from a questionnaire completed by 556 respondents are used to estimate a Latent Class Model. Results reveal the existence of eight distinct consumption patterns, some of them far from the Mediterranean tradition. Socialization is the main motivation for alcohol consumption. Consumption of wine, the traditional Mediterranean drink, appears to be in the process of being re-discovered and re-appreciated.","[Agnoli, Lara] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Burgundy Sch Business, CEREN, EA 7477, 29 Rue Sambin, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Boeri, Marco] RTI Hlth Solut, Hlth Preference Assessment Grp, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Scarpa, Riccardo; Capitello, Roberta; Begalli, Diego] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",Burgundy School of Business; University of Verona; Durham University; University of Waikato,"Agnoli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Burgundy Sch Business, CEREN, EA 7477, 29 Rue Sambin, F-21000 Dijon, France.",lara.agnoli@bsb-education.com; mboeri@rti.org; riccardo.scarpa@univr.it; roberta.capitello@univr.it; diego.begalli@univr.it,"Boeri, Marco/D-9656-2011; Agnoli, Lara/H-5347-2019; Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009; Begalli, Diego/F-6627-2014","Agnoli, Lara/0000-0003-1136-8014; Boeri, Marco/0000-0001-7346-2132; Begalli, Diego/0000-0002-2224-9881",,,,,58,15,15,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

The estimation results of a dynamic spatial panel data model confirm the relevance of spatial network effects in export diversification: indirect effects (spatial spillovers) strongly reinforce direct effects, while spatial proximity to large countries accelerates the diversification process. In about 10 years the whole space-time diffusion of the diversification shock is widely completed.

Valuation results were examined using discrete choice models across three samples from Korea, China and Japan. The impact of social desirability on the protection value was tested as the relationship between willingness-to-pay estimates from the conventional subjective questioning approach (i.e., my preferences) and an alternative projective questioning approach (i.e., others' preferences). The results demonstrated significant spillover benefits and the extent to which value spillovers work is substantially influenced not only by types of resources and national backgrounds, but also by social desirability bias. Although the overall findings support significant global spillover effects, the potentially inflating impact of social desirability bias might mask their true gravity because the bias is likely to be stronger in the hosting communities than in the international counterparts. Weak global spillovers might be observed using the conventional subjective questioning even when they are substantial in reality. Accordingly, a stronger engagement of international communities in the conservation activities involving globally significant environmental and cultural heritage sites might be granted.","[Choi, Andy S.] Natl Inst Ecol, Seocheon 33657, Choongnam, South Korea; [Lee, Choong-Ki] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Tanaka, Katsuya] Shiga Univ, Res Ctr Sustainabil & Environm, Hikone, Shiga 5228522, Japan; [Xu, Honggang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National Institute of Ecology; Kyung Hee University; Shiga University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Choi, AS (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Ecol, Seocheon 33657, Choongnam, South Korea.",kecc21@hanmail.net,"Wang, Jiahui/GRR-4965-2022; Choi, Andy/P-6006-2019; Lee, Choong-Ki/AAH-9113-2020","Choi, Andy/0000-0001-6124-8999; Tanaka, Katsuya/0000-0003-0455-0133",,,,,49,3,3,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Variation in the cultural dimension arises from different cultural groups across state borders in Switzerland.

While individuals from the two cultural groups had identical labor force participation rates near retirement in 1970, they differ by almost three percent in 2000.

The GTAP-E model has been extended to allocate the subsidy directly to each eligible sector. The simulation of the subsidy policy has been supplemented by introducing an improvement of energy efficiency to non-agricultural sectors and of resource efficiency by using endowment factors in the agricultural sector. Results indicate that, with the current budget of A$2.55 billion, or US$1.86 billion (Scenario 1), Australia can only achieve the minimum cumulative emissions reduction target of 225 MtCO(2)-e during 2015-20. Australia needs a budget of US$2.08 billion (Scenario 2) to achieve the maximum cumulative emissions reduction target of 279 MtCO(2)-e. In both scenarios, the agricultural sector receives the highest payment from the Australian Federal Government under the subsidy programme, followed by the electricity generation sector. Under the scheme, Australia experiences only a mild contraction in the economy, with a reduction of real GDP by 037% and 0.55% in the two scenarios, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to understand the constraints between the preferred and actual choices of elderly living arrangements in China. We first establish a standardized theoretical model and derive two hypotheses on choice constraints. Based on the CHARLS database, we empirically test the theoretical hypotheses based on multiple-step empirical tests. Our findings are as follows. 1) The correlation between elderly income and the likelihood of living with their children is nonlinear: when the elderly prefers to live apart, their higher absolute income provides a greater likelihood that they can do so, and when they prefer to live with their children, the relative income of the elderly and their children are important in the likelihood of living together. 2) The poorer the health status of the elderly, the greater likelihood that they live with their children, particularly if they have daughters. The results are robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity issue, the passive choice situation, and volatility in preference.","[Fan, Ying; Fang, Shuai; Yang, Zan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Inst Real Estate Studies, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Inst Real Estate Studies, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",fanying13@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; fangs15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; zanyang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Yang, Zan/G-7619-2015","FAN, Ying/0000-0003-0189-9524; Fang, Shuai/0000-0002-3108-1072","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71461137002, 71673154]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The research is supported by the funding from National Natural Science Foundation of China [71461137002, 71673154].",,37,20,21,5,54,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Through a narrative analysis, we identify historical policy changes leading to expansions or contractions in agency mortgage holdings. Based on those regulatory events that we classify as unrelated to short-run cyclical or credit market shocks, we find that an increase in mortgage purchases by the agencies boosts mortgage lending, in particular refinancing, and lowers mortgage rates. Agency purchases also influence prices in other asset markets, stimulate residential investment, and expand homeownership. We compare these effects to those of conventional monetary policy shocks, and we provide evidence on the interactions between housing credit and monetary policies.","[Fieldhouse, Andrew J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Dallas, TX USA; UCL, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Ctr Macroecon, London, England",Cornell University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University College London,"Fieldhouse, AJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Mertens, Karel/F-1275-2011","Ravn, Morten/0000-0003-2703-2558","ADEMU (H2020) [649396]; ESRC Centre for Macroeconomics; ESRC [ES/R009295/1, ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649396] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme",ADEMU (H2020); ESRC Centre for Macroeconomics; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"We are grateful to the editor and referees for their comments, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development as well as Shane Sherlund for providing data, and to conference discussants and participants at various seminars for useful comments.

Such disagreement stems from adherence to disparate theoretical models that preclude the use of significant explanatory variables. Our paper contributes to this scattered literature by demonstrating the presence of significant bias in the most common approaches to this question. We do so by comparing the Neoclassical, behavioral, and macro approaches to explaining M&A activity. Finding that the assumptions of these respective paradigms have inhibited individual researchers from including important determinants of M&A, we show that these constraints have generated misleading point estimates. By constructing a more holistic model of M&A activity, we produce more accurate estimates of merger determinants and reveal the bias of previous estimation techniques. Additionally, we relax the common, yet unrealistic, assumption that firms are homogeneous, showing that the determinants of M&A vary by firm size, region, and sector. These results demonstrate that an aggregated approach to merger determinants conceals important variation. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We apply Bayesian techniques to estimate the transition probabilities of the model which allows to incorporate information from other countries. Based on the model, we argue that the historical record of Austrian fiscal policy is consistent with a stable long-run distribution of the debt-GDP ratio with an expected value close to the 60% threshold of the Maastricht treaty. Our results suggests that the strong increase in the debt-GDP ratio in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis should be seen as a transitory tail event rather than as a sign of long-run unsustainability. However, we also show that the existence of a stable long-run distribution depends on a continuing tendency of fiscal policy to lean against debt by reducing the primary deficit in face of rising debt. Finally we assess how exogenous shocks to the primary deficit and real GDP growth affect the model-implied distribution.","[Goedl, Maximilian; Zwick, Christoph] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Goedl, M (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria.",maximilian.goedl@uni-graz.at,,,"Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Austrian Central Bank, Anniversary Fund) [15786]; Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation","Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Austrian Central Bank, Anniversary Fund); Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation","This paper was supported by funds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Austrian Central Bank, Anniversary Fund, project number: 15786).

The firm chooses the date on which to undertake an R&D investment project that offers it a chance of developing an innovation, which is immediately patented and commercialized. Thereafter, the firm must pay periodic renewal fees to keep the patent alive. This paper finds that greater uncertainty does not lead to a universal effect on the renewal probability. When there is no uncertainty, the firm will always renew the patent before a certain date but will never renew it after that date. When there is uncertainty, the renewal probability will decline smoothly over time toward the expiration date. This paper also finds that a firm that is more likely to be successful in its R&D investment is more likely to renew its patent right. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

To identify international tendencies among credit and output cycles, we perform cycle synchronisation calculations based on wavelet analysis. Then, we build clusters to assess the existence of global patterns among cycles. Our results suggest that the pre-crisis period was one of internal synchronisation between financial and output cycles across countries, while the post-crisis period has been marked by international synchronisation. Our findings confirm the existence of one global financial cycle. Additionally, we find that the largest financial cycle is mostly driven by a global factor, which raises doubts about the effectiveness of domestically-conducted macroprudential policy and highlights the need for international cooperation among policymakers.","[Kurowski, Lukasz; Rogowicz, Karol] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02544 Warsaw, Poland; [Kurowski, Lukasz; Rogowicz, Karol] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Rogowicz, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02544 Warsaw, Poland.",lukasz.kurowski@doktorant.sgh.waw.pl; karol.rogowicz@doktorant.sgh.waw.pl,"Kurowski, Łukasz/R-3631-2019","Kurowski, Łukasz/0000-0002-3306-4276; Rogowicz, Karol/0000-0002-4288-1446",Warsaw School of Economics [KZiF/S/22/17],Warsaw School of Economics,The paper has been prepared within the research project no.

We apply the matrix transformation technique (MTT)-based forecasting method on China's 42-sector IO tables in 1992-2020 and build up a database named China Input-Output Database (CIOD). Then, we compare the CIOD with other three main databases that also provide China's IO tables. The result shows the CIOD data match the real data by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) best. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.","[Zheng, Haitao; Fang, Qi; Wang, Cheng; Ren, Ruoen] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Haitao] MoE Key Lab Complex Syst Anal & Management Decis, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunyun] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Peking University,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",zhenghaitao@buaa.edu.cn; fangqi305@buaa.edu.cn; wangcheng@buaa.edu.cn; jiang_yunyun@163.com; ruoen8324@vip.sina.com,"Fang, Qi/AAA-2144-2021","Zheng, Haitao/0000-0002-0142-8872","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371021, 71401192, 71690245, 71420107025, 71333014]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) [SS2014AA012303]; Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of Ministry of Education [17YJA790097]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Fund of Ministry of Education,"We are very grateful to three anonymous referees and the editor, Prof. Sushanta Mania, for their valuable comments and suggestions.

For example, firms considering a merger must determine the merger's profitability, but would prefer to keep their information private if the deal fails. In the model, agents with different traits reveal information to a potential partner to determine if they share the same type, but face a penalty depending on the accuracy of their partner's posterior beliefs. With limited signaling, there is a universally-preferred dynamic communication protocol in which traits are sequentially revealed depending on the sensitivity of the trait. Interestingly, the rarity of an agent's traits plays no role due to the balance of opposing effects: although revealing a rare trait reveals more information immediately, it also screens more partners from later learning information about other traits.

Yet, the role of childcare time has received scant attention in the macroeconomics literature. We develop a life cycle model in which the time dimension of childcare plays a central role. An important contribution of the paper is estimation of the parameters of a childcare production function using data on primary and secondary childcare time as reported in the American Time Use Survey (2003-2014). The model does a better job matching the observed life-cycle patterns of womens' time use than a model without childcare. Our counterfactual experiments show that the increase in the relative wage of women since the 1960s is an important factor in the increase in womens' work time; changes in fertility associated with the baby boom play a smaller role, and changes in the price of durables are found to have a negligible effect. We consider the effects of cheaper daycare. Not surprisingly, this experiment leads to greater use of daycare and more time allocated to market work. A knock-on effect of cheaper daycare is a substantial decline in primary childcare time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The single agent, in a dynamic exchange economy, treats the conditional uncertainty about the consumption and dividends next period as ambiguous. We calibrate the agent's ambiguity aversion to match only the first moment of the risk-free rate in data and measure the uncertainty each period conditional on the actual, observed history of (U.S.) macroeconomic growth outcomes. Ambiguity aversion accentuates the effect of conditional uncertainty endogenously in a dynamic way, depending on the history; for example, it increases during recessions. We show the model implied time series of asset returns substantially match the first and second conditional moments of observed return dynamics. In particular, we find the time-series properties of our model generated equity premium, which may be regarded as an index measure of revealed uncertainty, relates closely to those of the macroeconomic uncertainty indices developed recently in Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng, 2015 and Carriero, Clark, and Marcellino, forthcoming.","[Collard, Fabrice] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Mukerji, Sujoy] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Sheppard, Kevin] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Tallon, Jean-Marc] Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Oxford; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Collard, F (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France.",fabrice.collard@gmail.com; s.mukerji@qmul.ac.uk; kevin.sheppard@keble.ox.ac.uk; jean-marc.tallon@psemail.eu,,"Tallon, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1762-9633",Investissement d'Avenir Program [ANR-10-LABX-93],Investissement d'Avenir Program,"We thank three referees and the editor for thoughtful comments and suggestions.

By classifying all firms into different types based on their ultimate controlling shareholders, we found that SOEs in general underperform in the marketplace than private enterprises. However, among the SOEs in our sample, the SOEs controlled by central government outperformed all types of firms because they offered the highest asset turnover ratio and lowest business administration ratio by receiving favourable government treatment. We conclude that firm ownership type and work efficiency are the main factors that influence the differences in firm performance. In particular, the performance of SOEs controlled by central government is greatly determined by the degree of government intervention, which is referred to as State Capitalism.

In this framework, there exists a frictionless neoclassical steady state equilibrium characterized by a low natural real interest rate. In addition, if wages are sufficiently rigid and the natural real interest rate sufficiently low, then there also exists a Keynesian secular stagnation steady state characterized by under-employment, low inflation, and a binding zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. As wages become more flexible, the Keynesian steady state diverges away from the neoclassical steady state, until wages are so flexible that it ceases to exist. If monetary policy is excessively restrictive, then the secular stagnation steady state is the unique steady state equilibrium of the economy. The optimal policy response to secular stagnation is to move the economy to the neoclassical steady state. This can either be achieved by raising the central bank's inflation ceiling or by taxing wealth and subsidizing investment in physical capital. This optimal tax policy is revenue-neutral.

Their effect on the economy is persistent and often exceeds initial projections. They can also be a strong driver of widening inequality. Therefore it is important that measures be taken to minimize the risk of such events while strengthening the potential for economies to innovate and prosper (Phelps, Mass Flourishings: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge and Change, 2013). An economy's resilience to crises and recessions can also be strengthened. Minimizing risks requires the accurate monitoring of home-grown vulnerabilities in realtime; coping with the consequences means identifying and putting in place policy settings and mechanisms that can help absorb the impact of a severe downturn and facilitate a swift rebound of economic activity.

Legal-economic theorists argue that legal philosophies such as common law and civil law have developed differently over centuries and have persistent effects. In this paper, we argue that the effects of culture and institutions should not be analyzed in isolation from each other, as this disregards their interactions. We merge the two separate literatures on cultural attributes and legal origin theories, and derive a hypothesis regarding their joint effects on labor market regulations. We hypothesize that the effect of individualism on the political determination of labor regulations should be particularly pronounced in more market-oriented economic systems (as in British common law countries) compared to more rigid and bureaucratic state-centered systems (as in French civil law countries). Market oriented economies give individual effort and ability greater room to flourish, which in individualistic cultures yields weaker labor regulations. The effect of individualism should be smaller in state centered systems. Using data on the average rigidity of labor regulations during the years 1950-2004 in 86 countries, we find that the negative effect of individualism on the rigidity of labor regulations is enhanced by the presence of a common law legal system. In fact, individualism has no effect on the rigidity of labor market regulations in civil law countries. Analogously, the negative effect of common law legal origin on labor market regulations is found to be conditional on the level of individualism. Individualism and common law legal systems are complements in the determination of labor regulations.","[Ang, James B.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Fredriksson, Per G.] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",Nanyang Technological University; University of Louisville,"Ang, JB (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",James.Ang@ntu.edu.sg; per.fredriksson@louisville.edu,"Ang, James B/N-4115-2013","Ang, James/0000-0001-9497-0187; ren, xiao peng/0000-0002-6032-8249",Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2,"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","We thank the Editor Hongbin Li, two helpful referees, Michael Baker, Mike Barone, Dann Millimet, Beth Munnich, Bill Neilson, and Laura Tetreault for guidance and insightful comments.

Players want to link to the largest group given that linking costs for players of the same (different) characteristic are decreasing (increasing) in their commitments. The equilibrium concepts used are Nash equilibrium as well as one that looks for stability allowing for bilateral negotiations. Conditions are shown under which the endogenous choice of characteristics and commitments allow for multiple groups with segregated or connected networks. When group identity is partly endogenous, such that characteristics are fixed and players only choose commitment, it is shown that the equilibrium population commitment profile dictates whether the resulting network is segregated or connected. When group identity is fully endogenous, it is shown that multiple groups and segregated networks are possible equilibrium outcomes but such outcomes are not stable unless the group size additionally affects the costs of link formation.","[Dev, Pritha] Indian Inst Management, IIMA Vastrapur, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Dev, P (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, IIMA Vastrapur, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",pritha@iima.ac.in,,,,,,,53,8,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

People can behave alike for many reasons and the key to the design of our test, therefore, is the control of the other possible reasons for observing apparent peer effects.

We consider a disequilibrium macroeconomic model where agents' expectations on future capital gains affect aggregate demand. Agents' beliefs take two forms fundamentalist and chartist - and the relative weight of the two types of agents is endogenously determined. We show that there are two sources of instability arising from the interaction of the financial with the real part of the economy, and from the heterogeneous opinion dynamics. Two main conclusions are derived. On the one hand, perhaps surprisingly, the non-linearity embedded in the opinion dynamics far from the steady state can play a stabilizing role by preventing the economy from moving towards an explosive path. On the other hand, however, real-financial interactions and sentiment dynamics do amplify exogenous shocks and tend to generate persistent fluctuations and the associated welfare losses.

The present study aims to investigate the non-linear relationship among 14 developed European countries during 1995-2014. Final consumption expenditure to gross domestic product (FCE), current expenditure other than final consumption to gross domestic product (OCE), and government gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product (GFCF) were considered for measuring government size. The results indicate an asymmetric effect of FCE and GFCF on economic growth when they are above and below the optimal level. The optimum values of FEC and GFCF were estimated to be 16.63 and 2.31%, respectively. However, it is noted that OCE always has a negative effect on economic growth. In terms of policy prescriptions, governments of developed countries should be aware that misallocation of public expenditure can occur given it may likely become unproductive after passing an optimal size.

The results show that more advanced institutions help to dampen financial sector volatility, while institutional volatility feeds through directly to financial sector volatility in transition.

Using a Bayesian structural vector autoregression model with sign restrictions, we identify three types of shock: supply, demand and specific demand. The main results suggest that, over the period from 1990Q1 to 2014Q4, the oil shock had a relative larger impact than the iron ore shock on output and inflation, while the iron ore shock was the dominant source of interest and exchange rate movements. The effects crucially depend on the underlying sources of oil or iron ore price shifts. As Australia is a small open economy, oil and iron ore prices should be treated as exogenous factors. Real GDP responds negatively to a rise in oil prices driven by supply disruptions, but positively to a similar shock on the iron ore market. Higher global demand for these commodities has a positive impact on the economy, but the iron ore demand shock is about twice larger. However, a positive oil and iron ore price shock driven by specific demand lead to a temporary decline in real GDP.","[Hoang, Nam T.] Univ New England, UNE Business Sch, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Nguyen, Bao H.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Nguyen, Bao H.] Univ Econ HCM City UEH, Sch Econ, Hcm City, Vietnam",University of New England; Australian National University; Ho Chi Minh City University Economics,"Hoang, NT (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",nam.hoang@une.edu.au,"Hoang, Nam/H-5549-2018","Hoang, Nam/0000-0003-2938-1209; Nguyen, Bao/0000-0002-0563-5158",,,,,30,11,11,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Taking into account stylized facts on wealth accumulation, we model agent heterogeneity through differences in saving behavior, income source and time preference. We find that in the long run, public investment is Pareto-improving and that it reduces inequality in wealth, welfare, and income at the same time, if it is financed by a capital tax. Consumption tax financing is also Pareto-improving but distribution-neutral. Only for labor tax financing, a trade-off between equity and efficiency occurs. Additionally, we find that agents differ in their preferred tax rates. The results for capital and labor tax financing are valid for both, the case of decreasing and constant returns to accumulable factors.","[Klenert, David] Tech Univ Berlin, Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Klenert, David; Lessmann, Kai] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Mattauch, Linus; Lessmann, Kai] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Klenert, D (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",klenert@pik-potsdam.de,"; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Klenert, David/0000-0003-3186-0938; Lessmann, Kai/0000-0002-8839-343X; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,38,11,11,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Nevertheless, they continuously face discrimination and the difficulty, resulting from their traditional role, in finding or maintaining employment. Purpose of the article: The main objective of this study was an analysis of female unemployment and its determinants in Poland in 2016 from the spatial perspective. The following research questions were also specified: Is female unemployment dependent on social factors (do they play the key role)? Are the factors determining the level of female unemployment spatially diversified? Is the GWR model an effective tool in analysis of female unemployment? Methods: The research applied GIS and spatial analysis methods including Geographically Weighted Regression, which enables the identification of the variability of regression coefficients in the geographical space. The analysis was carried out based on statistical data presenting the share of unemployed women in the working age population for 380 Polish districts (NUTS 4, LAU 1) in 2016. Findings & Value added: The research results showed that in the period 2003-2016 the female unemployment was getting lower, but it was still higher than men. It was also spatially diversified. Moreover, the determinants of female unemployment were diverse in the geographic space and did not have a significant impact on the variable in all spatial units. The existence of clusters of districts, characterised by similar interactions and its strength, was also confirmed. The results of this analysis proved that non-economic (social) factors largely affected the level of female unemployment in Poland in 2016. Using GWR enabled drawing detailed conclusions concerning the determinants of female unemployment in Poland, it proved to be an effective tool for the analysis of this phenomenon.","[Lewandowska-Gwarda, Karolina] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Ul POW 3-5, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Lewandowska-Gwarda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Ul POW 3-5, PL-90255 Lodz, Poland.",karolina.lewandowska-gwarda@uni.lodz.pl,"Lewandowska-Gwarda, Karolina/I-3711-2019","Lewandowska-Gwarda, Karolina/0000-0001-9868-0689",,,,,35,7,7,2,11,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The analysis uses repeated cross sections of India's NSSO employment data from 1983 to 2008 merged with data on state-level minimum wage rates. Theoretically, the impact of the minimum wage on child work could go either way, so empirical evidence from a country with high rates of child labor and a myriad of minimum wage laws across states and industries helps to lessen the ambiguity. Results indicate that regardless of gender, in urban areas, a higher minimum wage reduces child labor in household work. In rural areas a similar result applies for girls while household labor does rise for boys.

The policy, developed in the wake of the global recession of 2008-09, was designed to boost local economies through job creation. Using monthly figures from the more than 900 municipalities making up the Spanish region of Catalonia, the paper exploits spatial and temporal variations in the Spanish Ministry of Public Administration's random approval of local investment policies, to estimate their impact on both unemployment and crime. The combination of difference-in-differences and IV estimates makes it possible to assess both the size and timing of the policy's impact on the local labor market and on municipal-level crime rates. While the policy did little to palliate the effects of the economic recession in the long run, local public finances did experience a short-term boost, resulting in a temporary reduction in local unemployment rates (as required by the policy), as well as a significant drop in crime rates.

Findings indicate that individuals are financially illiterate while interventions to increase the level of financial literacy are ineffective. The effect of financial literacy on financial behavior reported in correlation studies may be driven by some unknown third variable, such as individual cognitive ability. The current study investigated the role of cognitive and emotional factors in attaining financial literacy. In a representative sample of the general population, our regression models indicate that a central component of financial literacy can be traced to numeracy and the emotional attitude towards numbers (i. e. mathematics anxiety). Thus, a driving force behind becoming financially literate resides in the ability to understand numbers and having an emotional attitude towards numbers that does not interfere with an individual's daily engagement in activities involving mathematics and financial decisions.","[Skagerlund, Kenny; Vastfjall, Daniel] Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Skagerlund, Kenny; Lind, Therese; Stromback, Camilla; Tinghog, Gustav; Vastfjall, Daniel] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Div Econ, JEDILab, Linkoping, Sweden; [Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Natl Ctr Prior Setting Hlth Care, Linkoping, Sweden; [Vastfjall, Daniel] Decis Res, Eugene, OR USA",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Skagerlund, K (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.;Skagerlund, K (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Div Econ, JEDILab, Linkoping, Sweden.",kenny.skagerlund@liu.se,"Västfjäll, Daniel/F-9629-2014; Tinghög, Gustav/K-2961-2012","Tinghög, Gustav/0000-0002-8159-1249; Vastfjall, Daniel/0000-0003-2873-4500; Stromback, Camilla/0000-0002-0269-0899; Skagerlund, Kenny/0000-0003-1894-3595",,,,,41,90,100,2,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

The results indicate ability to send truthful messages-compared to no messages-improves quality traded, ultimately leading to higher social surplus and lower income inequality. When truthfulness is not required, trade volume does not increase, nor does quality traded improve. However, I find in this case buyers also are less likely to defect on bonus payments. The results have implications for the development and improvement of communication platforms designed to improve trading outcomes.

When tax and expenditure policies can affect the market distribution of income in ways that cannot be directly offset, those effects need to be taken into account, reducing the burden imposed on distortionary redistribution. The paper extends the 1976 Atkinson-Stiglitz results to a dynamic, overlapping generations model, correcting a misreading of the result on the desirability of a zero capital tax. That result required separability of consumption from labor and that the only unobservable differences among individuals were in (fixed) labor productivities. In a general equilibrium model, one needs to take into account the effects of policy changes on binding self-selection constraints. In a simple model with time separability but with non-separability between consumption and leisure, capital taxation depends on the complementarity/substitutability of leisure during work with retirement consumption. The final section constructs a simple two class model, capitalists who maximize dynastic welfare and workers who save for retirement, whose productivity can be enhanced by (publicly provided) education. It derives a simple expression for the optimal capital tax, which is positive, so long as the social welfare function is sufficiently equalitarian and the productivity of educational expenditures is sufficiently high.","[Stiglitz, Joseph E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, JE (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jes322@columbia.edu,,,INET; Roosevelt Institute; Inequality Project,INET; Roosevelt Institute; Inequality Project,"I am indebted to INET and the Roosevelt Institute, and the supporters of its Inequality Project for financial support; to Matthieu Teachout and to Naafis Mateen for research assistance; to Debarati Ghosh for editorial assistance; and to Simcha Barkai, Martin Guzman, Linus Mattauch, the editor, Henrik Eleven, and an anonymous referee for comments on an earlier draft.",,108,10,10,2,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

First, the panel unit root test results indicate that the house prices in euro zone countries were more correlated than the house prices in non-euro zone countries. Second, the house prices in various European countries converged towards the house prices in Germany, which uses the single currency, rather than towards those in the United Kingdom, indicating that single currency use increased the influence of the German housing market on other markets. Finally, the log t regression model, a new convergence test, was employed and determined that the house prices in various European countries were not converging before 1992 but began to do so after that year. After the euro was implemented as an official currency, the house prices in various countries converged towards a consistent level. On the basis of the relative transition paths, this study determines that the differences among housing markets in various countries have continuously decreased since 1992. The empirical results indicate that the law of one price is applicable to tradable goods and that single currency use can integrate housing markets, which include non -tradable goods.","[Tsai, I-Chun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Tsai, IC (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Finance, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",ictsai@nuk.edu.tw,"Tsai, I-Chun/H-6503-2018","Tsai, I-Chun/0000-0001-8277-2327",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST-103-2628-H-390-001],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",I would like to thank Professor Ali M.

Based on international estimates of the income elasticity of the VSL, one can transfer these values to other countries, leading to my VSL estimate for Australia of US$7.9 million, or A$10.0 million, which is over double the current Australia best-practices value. Transferring US VSL estimates to other nations after accounting for income differences will boost global VSL estimates. Potential refinements of the VSL based on age and income are also feasible. The VSL could serve a pivotal role in promoting safety by valuing lives in litigation contexts, regulatory sanctions, and corporate risk analyses.","[Viscusi, W.

First, the estimation results verify the existence of the spatial correlations in CO2 emissions across nations. Second, we find that the indirect effect of economic globalization on CO2 emissions is so significantly negative to overcome the positive direct effect, which implies a negative and significant total effect, so our results suggest that being surrounded by highly globalized countries has a positive effect on the environmental quality.

The paper attempts to shed empirical light on this issue by looking at the case of China. It employs an infrastructure-augmented production function framework and a growth regression model, and adopts panel threshold regressions to address non-linearity. The results show that infrastructure stocks (except railways) are more productive than other physical capital in raising output levels, but not so when it comes to the effect on long-term growth rates. The analysis also finds that infrastructure's productivity depends on whether it is oversupplied or in shortage relative to non-infrastructure capital.","[Zhang, Yin-Fang] Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Ji, Shengbao] China Univ Min & Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Manchester; China University of Mining & Technology,"Zhang, YF (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Global Dev Inst, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Yin-fang.zhang@manchester.ac.uk; jishengbao9646@126.com,,"Zhang, Yin-Fang/0000-0003-4949-2635",,,,,43,10,11,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

If marginal costs are increasing, public firms do not supply the entire market, leaving room for private firms to produce and possibly cooperate by restricting output. The presence of public firms makes collusion among private firms harder to sustain, and maybe even unprofitable. As the number of private firms increases, collusion may become easier or harder to sustain. Privatization makes collusion easier to sustain, and is socially detrimental whenever firms are able to collude after privatization (which is always the case if they are sufficiently patient).

An Investigation into the Interaction of Funder Motivations in Online Crowdfunding Campaigns,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PUBLIC-GOODS; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; FIELD EXPERIMENT; IMPURE ALTRUISM; INCENTIVES; IMAGE; DONATIONS,"This study investigates the interaction of motivations among contributors to online crowdfunding campaigns. Based on evidence from the literature on philanthropic behaviour, we argue that funder behaviour is likely to be driven by a combination of intrinsic, extrinsic and image enhancement motivations. We undertake an empirical investigation into the relationships between these factors by analysing data from an online rewards-based crowdfunding platform. These data not only reveal the monetary values of individual contributions to fundraising campaigns but also indicate particular combinations of motivations based on the material reward selected (if any) and the decision as to whether or not to contribute anonymously. We find that extrinsically motivated funders generally make larger contributions than intrinsically motivated funders, which does not suggest the presence of a crowding-out' effect given the presence of material incentives. We further show that named funders with intrinsic motivations contribute more than anonymous funders with intrinsic motivations, whereas the same pattern of behaviour is not observed among extrinsically motivated funders. The evidence from our study therefore suggests that image concerns interact with intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in different ways.","[Cox, Joe; Thang Nguyen] Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England; [Kang, Soong Moon] UCL, UCL Sch Management, London, England",University of Portsmouth; University of London; University College London,"Nguyen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Fac Business & Law, Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",thang.nguyen@port.ac.uk,,"Nguyen, Thang/0000-0001-5370-8545; Cox, Joe/0000-0001-7806-1194",,,,,34,20,22,0,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2018,71.0,2,,,,,187,212,,10.1111/kykl.12167,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD4JG,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000430468800001,0

This paper contributes to this literature by evaluating the impact of a program that aims at enhancing competitiveness of small and medium enterprises in Brazil by providing coaching and consulting on management and production practices. Specifically, the paper tests whether the program induces treated firms to reorganize knowledge by adding more layers of different skills and competencies to their workforces. Using a unique firm-level data set, the number of layers of knowledge of the firms are compared before and after the program. The impact of the program is identified by relying on an instrumental variable approach, exploiting the quasi-experimental roll-out of its implementation, which was carried out at different times across Brazilian regions. The analysis finds that the program had an effect and that this effect is heterogeneous. The program is particularly effective in promoting the reorganization of small and medium firms. The results confirm another finding of the literature, namely that in re-organized firms wage inequality increases. Finally, these results are used to discuss how the change in firms' organization is positively correlated with export performance.

We provide direct evidence on this question by examining the effects of an unexpectedly accepted and far-reaching referendum in Switzerland in February 2014. The outcome put several economically relevant agreements between Switzerland and its main trading partner, the European Union, at stake. Using firm-level panel data covering the 2009-2015 period and data from two special surveys levied shortly after the vote, we examine how the induced policy uncertainty affected investment of Swiss firms. Our Difference-in-Differences-in-Differences estimations and complementary survey results give strong evidence that the uncertainty caused by the vote dampened, as theoretically expected, investment of exposed firms with irreversible investment by as much as one quarter in the two years following the vote. Exposed firms that can reverse investment appear rather to increase investment in the year after the vote.

Consumers engage in costly search to find out whether products meet their needs. Consumer search is directed by prices when they are observable before search, in contrast to the case in which prices are discovered only after search, where search is naturally random. The equilibrium under price-directed search differs substantially from that under random search, despite certain similarities. We show that as search costs decrease, sales become more likely and firms earn higher expected profits under price-directed search, whereas the opposite holds under random search. Moreover, compared with random search, under price-directed search firms, expected profits are always lower, but consumer surplus and total welfare are higher provided that the search cost is sufficiently small.

I first introduced a new seed variety to a random subset of farmers in 82 villages. I then allowed the new variety to diffuse through farmer-to-farmer trading in a random half of villages. This mode of exchange is compared with demand that was approximated by selling the same seeds directly to farmers in the other half of villages. I find that direct trading between farmers leads to substantial under-adoption when compared to door-to-door sales suggesting that trading frictions exist and represent a barrier to technological diffusion. Caste identity explains some, but not all, of this puzzle. Specifically, farmers sharing the same surname or belonging to the same subcaste as the original seed recipients adopt at higher rates when farmers trade amongst themselves. Overall, the trading frictions in farmer-to-farmer exchange are severe enough to make door-to-door sales cost effective.","[Emerick, Kyle] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Emerick, K (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",kyle.emerick@tufts.edu,,,Institute for Economic Development at Boston University; World Bank; Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Institute for Economic Development at Boston University; World Bank(The World Bank India); Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(CGIAR),"I am grateful to Elisabeth Sadoulet and Alain de Janvry for numerous discussions and feedback I also thank Ted Miguel, Craig McIntosh, Jeremy Magruder, Sam Bazzi, Emily Oster, Kelsey Jack, Seema Jayachandran, Sofia Villas-Boas, Marshall Burke, Judson Boomhower, Ethan Ligon, and Michael Anderson for helpful comments and suggestions.

One key finding, which confirms those reported from other parts of the world, is that happiness declines as children grow into their teens. The present study discovers that this is related to declines in love, insight, fortitude and engagement: four aspects of mental capital essential to happiness, which may be associated with mounting pressures as children grow up. Pressures from extracurricular activities surprisingly appear to have a much greater adverse effect on happiness than pressures from school work. These results may reflect the fact that a child's disposable time decreases monotonically as they grow older through age 13, with extracurricular activities aggravating the lack of leisure. Perceived financial well-being of the household is found to be associated with children's happiness and children's love scores. A loving relationship between the parents and their respect for the child's opinions and privacy mitigate any intergenerational barrier to effective communication or negative effect from parents' age, and enhance happiness.","[Ho, Lok Sang] Lingnan Univ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ip, Patrick] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University; University of Hong Kong,"Ho, LS (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Lsho@Ln.edu.hk,"Ip, Patrick/E-9831-2010; Ho, Lok Sang/HKW-8900-2023","Ho, Lok Sang/0000-0002-9589-9121",Hong Kong HendersonLand Group,Hong Kong HendersonLand Group,"We thank HKECDRF for commissioning this study, the Hong Kong HendersonLand Group for its funding support, Sylvia Song, Andy Chu and Mars Lai for their research assistance.",,20,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In this paper, we show how increasing the substitutability between maternal time and market childcare can raise both FPR and TFR, and provide an explanation for the change in the TFR-FPR correlation. Simulations of a life-cycle model of married women's work and fertility decisions indicate that the FPR increases, whereas the TFR is U-shaped with regard to substitutability. The dynamic relationship depends on the relative strength of behavioral and composition effects: greater substitutability allows working women to have more children but it also attracts less productive women to enter the labor force, who trade childbirths for labor supply. The findings imply that raising substitutability to a sufficiently high level can achieve the two seemingly conflicting goals increasing female labor force participation and fertility rates.

However, bounded rationality and limited attention may lead to sub-optimal insurance coverage and higher-than-expected out-of-pocket payments. In this paper, we study the impact of providing personalized information on health plan choices in a laboratory experiment. We seek to more closely mimic real-life choices by randomly providing an incentivized distraction to some individuals. We find that providing personalized information significantly improves health plan choices. The positive effect is even larger and longer-lasting if individuals are distracted from their original task. In addition to providing decision support, receiving personalized information restores the awareness of the choice setting to a level comparable to the case without distraction thus reducing inertia.

Those with pro-cyclical payoffs, such as foreign currency debt, generate substantial negative pecuniary externalities because they lead to large repayments and contractionary exchange rate depreciations during financial crises. Conversely, capital flows with an insurance component, such as FDI or equity, are largely benign. We construct an externality pricing kernel and use sufficient statistics and DSGE model simulations to quantify the externalities that materialized during past financial crises. We find stark differences depending on the payoff profile, justifying taxes of up to 3% for dollar debt but close to zero for FDI. These findings contrast with the existing literature, which has suggested that policymakers should focus on reducing over-borrowing rather than changing the composition of external liabilities.

These volatility indices are the crude oil volatility index (OVX) and the energy sector volatility index (VXXLE), which measure the market's expectation of 30-day volatility of crude oil prices and energy sector returns, respectively. We find that energy-related volatility indices tend to fall following several US macroeconomic news releases and OPEC meetings. Put differently, these news releases resolve investors' uncertainty about the future development of energy-related markets. Our results also suggest that macroeconomic releases and oil-related events do not seem to exert significantly different impacts on energy market uncertainty. We further document that the observed announcement day patterns cannot be exploited to generate significant returns using variance swaps once we incorporate transaction costs. Our findings are relevant because there are currently no other volatility derivatives traded in exchange markets, such as options or futures, that offer investors pure exposure to energy-related volatility alone as variance swaps do.

This period of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policies had significant effects on financial markets and created a global investment environment dominated by a single global factor of central bank policy. Looking forward, normal markets should include: (i) higher interest rates, but lower in the steady-state than pre-crisis; (ii) greater cross-country interest differentials; and (iii) lower cross-asset return correlations. In this environment, idiosyncratic macroeconomic differences across countries matter more than a risk on/off global factor that dominated in the post-crisis era so that the opportunity set for global macro investors should be better than it has been in the 10 years since the crisis. The future investment environment will not be simply that of the pre-crisis era but will reflect the evolution of the world economy.

I determine how the long-run equilibrium coalition shapes incentives to invest, show the existence of a unique steady state, and investigate how the ease to capture rents affects economic performance. The use of numerical simulations concerning a global sample of countries demonstrates that contest intensity can sometimes be beneficial, despite wasteful grabbing behaviours, due to a mechanism related to the concentration of power. When rents become easier to capture, dominant groups have an incentive to expand their influence further. This adjustment can be beneficial as these groups contribute most to capital accumulation.","[Pecher, Pierre] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Pecher, P (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France.",pierre.pecher@univ-amu.fr,,,A*MIDEX project - Investissements d'Avenir French Government programme [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; ANR project - French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-17-CE39-0009-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE39-0009] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),A*MIDEX project - Investissements d'Avenir French Government programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANR project - French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research was carried out thanks to the support of the A*MIDEX project (No. ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02) funded by the Investissements d'Avenir French Government programme, managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR), and the ANR project (No. ANR-17-CE39-0009-01) funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), within the framework of the TMENA and TMENA2 projects (http://christophemuller.net/tmena/).

We use the index decomposition analysis to derive the true energy efficiency by separating out the impact of structural shifts in economic activity on energy intensity. We then employ both STSM and LSDVC models to examine and quantify the impact of the energy efficiency on CO2 emissions accounting for non-economic factors such as consumers' lifestyle, attitudes and environmental awareness. The application for 30 OECD countries shows that at the group level, the decline in energy intensity predominately occurred due to improvements in energy efficiency while at the country level, there are mixed contributions from improvement in energy efficiency and structural shift to the decline in energy intensity. The econometric results show that income has the most significant positive impact on CO2 emissions but improving energy efficiency makes the biggest contribution to driving down CO2 emissions. The method further enables the separate assessment of non-economic behavioural effects, which are found to exert a non-trivial influence on CO2 emissions in parallel with changes in energy efficiency. We conclude that energy efficiency remains a key option but that there is also a need for additional policies aiming for behavioural and other non-economic changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Decades of communist socialization and the repressive rule of a single-party have left their left-wing fingerprint on East Germany. In this paper we show that voters act rationally: given negative life circumstances experienced under the rule of the communist party, they display retrospective voting even decades later. Our insight is based on the analysis of 19 years of revealed and stated party preferences. We argue that life at the Border Region to West Germany was particularly hard and find that East German voters who lived close to the inner-German border before the reunification of the two states are 5.9 percentage points less likely to lean toward the successor party to East Germany's communists. Given that over the years roughly every fifth person has revealed preferences for the communists in the East, this translates to over thirty percent reduction. We confirm the preferences with administrative data: The electoral punishment estimated at the district-level amounts to a reduction of 1.3 percentage points of votes for the party.

Our empirical analysis combines police incident reports with observations of local traffic data in Los Angeles from 2011 to 2015. This rich dataset allows us to link traffic with criminal activity at a fine spatial and temporal dimension. Our identification relies on deviations from normal traffic to isolate the impact of abnormally high traffic on crime. We find that extreme traffic increases the incidence of domestic violence, a crime shown to be affected by emotional cues, but not other crimes. The result is robust to a variety of specifications and falsification tests. The results represent a lower bound of the psychological costs of traffic congestion, since most drivers stuck in traffic do not commit domestic violence but still bear some emotional costs.","[Beland, Louis-Philippe; Brent, Daniel A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Beland, LP (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",lbeland@lsu.edu; dbrent@lsu.edu,,"Beland, Louis-Philippe/0000-0001-7458-4641; Brent, Daniel/0000-0002-7088-8629",,,,,37,22,29,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

While this may have intuitive appeal, this paper shows that it might be wishful thinking. Economic theory tells us that flexible retirement policies can have a zero or positive effect on labour force participation (LFP) while the effect on hours worked can be positive or negative depending on the distribution of leisure preferences. Thus, the overall effect is ex ante unclear. Empirical results from nine OECD countries show that the effect on LFP is ex post small and positive while the effect on hours worked is negative. Overall, there is no evidence of the desired positive effect on total labour supply (TLS). We conclude that the flexibility reforms enacted so far are dangerous instruments if one wants to increase TLS because they postpone or even replace the instalment of more effective policies and may, even worse, reduce total labour volume.","[Boersch-Supan, Axel] Munich Ctr Econ Aging MEA, Munich, Germany; Max Planck Inst fu Sozialrecht & Sozialpolit, Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Technical University of Munich; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Börsch-Supan, A (通讯作者)，Munich Ctr Econ Aging MEA, Munich, Germany.",boersch-supan@mea.mpisoc.mpg.de,,,,,,,72,18,18,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Creative destruction with respect to firms' own product innovation lessens market power after an optimal point of development and extensive costs of implementing new processes reduce firms' benefits beyond a certain level. Empirical findings based on Indian pharmaceutical firms affirm inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and market power operationalized by Lerner index. The results are robust to alternative measure of market power namely profitability.

The research is important for the analysis of monetary policy as it helps understand the origin of price formation from both sectoral and country perspective. With a multi-level factor model we decompose product-level inflation rates into the CEE region-wide, sector, country, country-sector, and idiosyncratic components. The outcomes indicate that CEE region-wide and country specific components are more persistent than sector and product-level components, which is in line with similar studies for core EU countries. Regional factors explain about 17% of variance in monthly price changes, which is more than any other factors (below 10% each). This result is at odds with the assumptions of many sectoral DSGE models and empirical evidence on the importance of sectoral price shocks in developed economies. The difference may be related to the conclusion that the first regional factor is associated with common disinflationary process that occurred in CEE economies in the 2000s, whereas the second one reveals significant correlations with global factors, especially commodity prices and euro area price developments.","[Halka, Aleksandra; Szafranski, Grzegorz] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland; [Szafranski, Grzegorz] Univ Lodz, Inst Finance, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; University of Lodz,"Halka, A (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland.",aleksandra.halka@nbp.pl; grzegorz.szafranski@nbp.pl,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,3,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The public facility is financed either by voluntary anonymous contributions (VAC) or taxes. We find that rates of taxation chosen by majority vote remain at an intermediate level close to the finite-horizon optimum, and the experimental economies sustain public goods at levels between the finite- and infinite-horizon optima. This contrasts with a rapid decline of public goods under VAC. Both the payoff efficiency and production of private goods are higher when taxes are set endogenously instead of being fixed at the infinite-horizon optimum level externally. When taxes are adjusted to the respective finite-horizon optimum each period, production levels and efficiency remain as high as in the voting treatments at least in the latter half of the sessions. When subjects choose between VAC and taxation, 23 out of 24 majority votes favor taxation, demonstrating a clear preference for enforceable taxes to finance public goods in this setting.

In addition, ministers from the 11 other TPP signatories have confirmed their intention to proceed with the TPP without U.S. participation. Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we estimate welfare and sectoral output adjustment effects of alternative sequencings of MRTAs on ASEAN countries. Welfare gains for ASEAN countries under the scenario led by the RCEP, followed by RCEP + Taiwan and a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), are greater than or equal to those under the scenario led by TPP sans US, followed by an enlarged TPP and an FTAAP. When the two scenarios are assumed to develop at the same time, welfare gains of the RCEP and TPP-11 countries are found to be less than the sum of the gains under the first two scenarios.

This paper examines the biased data revision pattern of Chinese provinces under incentives created by energy-saving mandates. The data revisions conducted by provinces in the treatment group are evaluated against those carried out by their counterparts in the control group. Empirical evidence is provided that some provinces in the treatment group conducted biased data revisions by taking advantage of benchmark revisions of historical data following the 2008 Economic Census. These provinces adjusted their base-year energy consumption figure upward in seeking to reach the 2010 energy intensity reduction targets numerically. In institutional terms, strong political incentives are formed by assigning energy-saving indicators a veto power in cadre performance assessment In a self reported statistical regime, checks and balances are particularly weak regarding benchmark revisions of historical data. The findings of this paper suggest that the data quality of associated official statistics at the local level is undermined by energy-saving mandates. To improve the data quality of the official statistics, new checks and balances should be installed for local statistics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We find evidence that a longer commute time is associated with lower levels of both life satisfaction and happiness, especially when the commute times are extreme (>= 1 hour per day). A multiple mediation analysis further indicates that the relation between commute time and happiness is partially mediated by the time spent on daily activities, particularly sleep.

We use historical data to predict, based on information available prior to the beginning of a given season, whether a coach will be fired or promoted after that season. Indices created from these models are used, along with other relevant data, to analyze the risky decision to attempt a fourth down conversion. We find that decision-making is sensitive to perceived job stability. Coaches who are more likely to be fired become more conservative, attempting fewer fourth down conversions. Conversely, coaches who are more likely to be promoted undertake more risk by attempting to convert more fourth downs. The result is that coaches with less job security are more likely to make decisions that are sub-optimal from the perspective of win-maximization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To relax this tradeoff, a regime can disseminate propaganda through its education system. I show that even Bayesian citizens can be influenced by propaganda. By deterring political opposition, propaganda can induce nondemocracies to invest in education when they otherwise would not, improving social welfare.

To shed light on this question, we introduce a nonparametric counterfactual decomposition of labor productivity growth into growth of the capital-labor ratio (K/L), technological productivity (TEP) and total factor productivity (TFP). Our nonparametric specification enables us to model technology allowing for heterogeneity across all relevant dimensions (i.e. countries, sectors and time). Using data spanning from the 1960s to the 2000s, covering 42 OECD and non OECD countries across 11 manufacturing sectors, we find TEP and TFP to account for roughly 46 and -6% of labor productivity growth respectively, on average. While technological growth at the world level is driven primarily by the US and a handful of other OECD countries, we find strong evidence of convergence in both technology and capital-labor ratios. Interestingly, very few of the usual growth determinants are found to enhance the process of technological catching-up.","[Battisti, Michele] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy; [Del Gatto, Massimo] Univ G dAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy; [Del Gatto, Massimo] CRENoS, Chieti, Italy; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33132 USA",University of Palermo; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; University of Miami,"Parmeter, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Miami, FL 33132 USA.",michele.battisti@unipa.it; m.delgatto@unich.it; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,"Del Gatto, Massimo/ABG-4159-2021","Del Gatto, Massimo/0000-0002-3261-8038",,,,,67,22,24,4,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

A specific contemporary challenge is to account for the prolonged slow growth and stagnant productivity that has followed the post-financial crisis recession, along with low inflation despite low unemployment (notably in the UK). We set out a simple three-equation model, which extends the core model in our two recent books (Carlin and Soskice, 2006, 2015) to one with two equilibria and two associated macroeconomic policy regimes. One is the standard inflation-targeting policy regime with equilibrium associated with central bank inflation targeting through monetary policy. It is joined by a second, Keynesian policy regime and equilibrium, with a zero lower bound (ZLB) in the nominal interest rate and a ZLB in inflation in which only fiscal policy is effective (Ragot, 2015). Our approach is related to the Benigno and Fornaro (2016) Keynesian-Wicksellian model of growth with business cycles. It diverges from New Keynesian models because although we attribute model-consistent expectations to the policy-maker, we do not assume that these are the basis for inflation and growth expectations of workers and firms. We compare our approach to Ravn and Sterk's related multiple equilibrium New Keynesian model (Ravn and Sterk, 2016).","[Carlin, Wendy] UCL, CEPR, London, England; [Carlin, Wendy] Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Soskice, David] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Carlin, W (通讯作者)，UCL, CEPR, London, England.;Carlin, W (通讯作者)，Ctr Macroecon, London, England.",w.carlin@ucl.ac.uk; d.w.soskice@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,16,17,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

A key mechanism for explaining these distributional features is proportional random growth. We investigate the comparative statics of a well-defined class of random growth models when allowing for stochastically ordered shifts in the wealth return process. An order-contingent monotone comparative statics property is identified, according to which pure increases in risk (e.g. higher volatility of capital returns) foster top wealth concentration whereas first-order stochastically dominated shifts in the return process (induced by e.g. proportional capital income taxation) rather lower inequality at the upper end of the distribution. Our analysis points to the potentially ambiguous effects on top wealth inequality of introducing or modifying capital income tax treatments in the presence of stochastic returns.","[Di Pietro, Christian; Sorge, Marco M.] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Sorge, Marco M.] Univ Gottingen, CSEF, Gottingen, Germany",University of Salerno; University of Gottingen,"Sorge, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Fisciano, SA, Italy.;Sorge, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, CSEF, Gottingen, Germany.",cdipietro@unisa.it; msorge@unisa.it,,"DI PIETRO, CHRISTIAN/0000-0002-1683-155X; Sorge, Marco Maria/0000-0002-8311-039X",,,,,26,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Exploiting a reform in Germany that induced school districts to expand ECC at different points in time, we find strong but diverging effects on children's motor and socio-emotional skills. Children who were most likely to attend ECC benefit in terms of their motor skill development. Children who were least likely to attend ECC gain in terms of their socio-emotional skill development, especially boys and children from disadvantaged families, such as those with low education or migration backgrounds. Simulating expansions of ECC, we find that a moderate expansion fosters motor skills for all children and language skills for boys and immigrant children. A progressive expansion of ECC improves all children's socio-emotional development but neither their motor skills nor their language skills.","[Felfe, Christina] Univ St Gallen, Varnbuelstr 14, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Felfe, Christina; Lalive, Rafael] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Lalive, Rafael] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Lalive, Rafael] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Lalive, Rafael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lalive, Rafael] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of St Gallen; Ifo Institut; University of Lausanne; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lalive, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",Christina.Felfe@unisg.ch; Rafael.Lalive@unil.ch,,"Lalive, Rafael/0000-0003-1938-692X",Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research LIVES Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives (NCCR LIVES) - Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-160590]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Economic Policy Profile Area of the University of St. Gallen,Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research LIVES Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives (NCCR LIVES) - Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Economic Policy Profile Area of the University of St. Gallen,"We would like to thank Olof Aslund, Michael Baker, Mark Dusheiko, Martin Eckhoff Andresen, Maria Fitzpatrick, Eric French, Martin Huber, Steven Lehrer, Edwin Leuven, Michael Kosfeld, Patrick Kline, Claudia Senik, Marianne Simonsen, Mark Stabile, Sergio Urzua, Chris White, Ludger WOssmann, Danny Yagan, the editor and three anonymous referees for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

As life expectancy increases, among other reasons, many governments in developed countries have begun to reform key features of their programs, such as increasing the eligibility age for access to social benefits. However, as in the case of South Africa, some opt to decrease the eligibility age for access to such pension benefits. The South African old age pension, which is one of the most expansive cash transfers in developing countries, puts a significant monthly cash transfer in the hands of its recipients. This cash transfer is conditioned on age and a means test that is very generous to most South Africans. In this paper, we seek to understand the impact of such an increase in non-labour income on the labour force participation of older men by exploiting a phased-in reduction in pension eligibility age. We estimate that, at the median predicted market wage, pension age-eligibility reduces the probability of labour force participation by approximately 9.85% points for single males and 15.45% points for married males.","[Muchiri, Steve] Eastern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, Willimantic, CT 06226 USA; [Garen, John] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",Connecticut State University System; Eastern Connecticut State University; University of Kentucky,"Muchiri, S (通讯作者)，Eastern Connecticut State Univ, Dept Econ, Willimantic, CT 06226 USA.",muchiris@easternct.edu,,,,,,,35,3,3,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

By dividing government control voters force a lame duck to compromise on policies with an opposing legislature.

The neighborhood effects are confined by provincial borders, but do not diminish as the geographic scope of the neighborhood increases. Moreover, the effects are amplified by regulatory refonns and political cycles that increase the salience of coal mine safety. The findings of neighborhood effects on coal mine deaths are consistent with the logic of relative performance evaluation (RPE) as a mechanism for shaping policy outcomes.","[Shi, Xiangyu] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Xi, Tianyang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Yale University; Peking University,"Xi, TY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiangyu.shi@yale.edu; tyxi@nsd.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,54,42,46,9,58,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

The article revolves around a debate over depopulation in France that consumed the attention of the French Academy of Medicine in the winter and spring of 1935. Alexandre Nikolaevich Roubakine, arguably the most important intermediary on medical matters between Soviet Russia and France from 1921-1941, became the target of that debate, not so much for his views of depopulation as for his defense of the Soviet legalization of abortion. How did a Russian go-between become the target of a debate among the French medical elite? How did the issue of Soviet legalized abortion become intertwined in the Academy discussion?

Since Core Selection constrains us to exactly divide the value created by matched agents, the assignment problem corresponds to multiple two-player bankruptcy problems. From this we obtain equivalence between the Concede and-Divide (Aumann and Maschler. 1985) sharing method for the bankruptcy problem and the Fair Division solution (Thompson, 1981) for the assignment problem. In bankruptcy problems, the minimal rights of a claimant is what is left of the endowment when all claimants but himself have received their full claims. By the Minimal Rights First property, it is irrelevant if we distribute the minimal rights first or proceed on the original problem. By adapting the property to the assignment problem, we obtain two characterizations of the Fair Division solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Financial risk is often perceived as the risk that a company may default on its debt payments. The issue of the debt, default or prosperity of the company are presented in the article as one of the ways of the risk management. A prediction of corporate default is an inseparable element of the risk management. Mainly the consequences of risk are the engine of research and development of methods and models, which enable to predict economic and financial situation in specific conditions of global economies. Purpose of the article: The main aim of the presented article is to assess financial risks of Slovak entities, realized by the identification of significant factors and determinants affecting the prosperity of Slovak companies. Methods: To conduct the research we have used the data of Slovak enterprises, obtained from annual financial reports covering the year 2015 and the calculated financial ratios of profitability, activity, liquidity and indebtedness that may affect the financial health of the company were applied in the regression analysis. Realizing the multiple regression analysis, the statistically significant determinants that affect the future financial development of the company are identified. as well its the regression model of the bankruptcy prediction. Findings & Value added: In the research aimed at the management of financial risks in Slovak enterprises, IA e focused on the revelation of significant economic risk factors using multiple regression. I he results suggest that the most significant predictors are net return on capital, cash ratio, quick ratio, current ratio, net working capital, RE/TA ratio, current debt ratio, financial debt ratio and current assets turnover based on which the decision about the future company default can be made. These factors are significant enough to manage financial risks and to affect the profitability and prosperity of the company.","[Valaskova, Katarina; Kliestik, Tomas; Kovacova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Valaskova, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",katarina.valaskova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015; Valaskova, Katarina/O-9250-2015; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015","Valaskova, Katarina/0000-0003-4223-7519; Kovacova, Maria/0000-0003-2081-6835",,,,,65,102,104,16,111,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

These demands are supposed to be negatively related to the factor prices, namely the wage rate and the interest rate. The theoretical cases in which these neoclassical properties fail to hold are regarded as anomalies. We compute the aggregate values for production, capital and labour and find that the neoclassical postulates do not hold for the detailed dataset that we consider. The obvious implication of this result is that the models and analysis based on the aggregate neoclassical production functions are ill founded, as they are based on something that does not exist.","[Zambelli, Stefano] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Zambelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",stefano.zambelli@unitn.it,,,,,,,63,16,16,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

First, restaurant exit and entry both rise following a hike. Second, there is no change in employment among continuing restaurants. We develop a model of industry dynamics based on putty-clay technology that is consistent with these findings. In the model, continuing restaurants cannot change employment, and thus industry-level adjustment occurs gradually through exit of labor-intensive restaurants and entry of capital-intensive restaurants. Interestingly, the putty-clay model matches the small estimated short-run disemployment effect of the minimum wage found in other studies, but produces a larger long-run disemployment effect.","Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; UCL, IFS, London, England; CEPR, London, England; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Unaffiliated, Cambridge, MA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"French, E (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",eric.french.econ@gmail.com,,,"ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/P001831/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,49,65,4,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Agents are randomly matched in pairs to engage in a prisoner dilemma. The matching process is assortative in actions, that is, cooperators are more likely to be matched with cooperators, defectors are more likely to be matched with defectors. Agents exhibit a form of cultural intolerance: when two agents of different cultures are matched, they suffer a cost due to their cultural differences. We find that when cultural intolerance is sufficiently strong, homophily emerges together with perfect correlation between culture and behavior: all agents from one cultural group cooperate, while all agents from the other cultural group defect, and interactions among agents within the same cultural group are more frequent. The relation between cultural intolerance and societal welfare is non-monotonic. In particular, stronger cultural intolerance can increase cooperation when action-assortativity is weak, while it can increase defection when action-assortativity is strong. Moreover, everyone cooperating does not necessarily maximize total welfare unless cultural intolerance can be made sufficiently weak. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We apply an instrumental variable approach to take potentially endogenous locational choices into account, and we categorize immigrants into two groups according to the cultural values and beliefs of their country of origin to understand how the cultural distance between natives and immigrants affects this relationship. We find that the share of culturally different immigrants is a significant and sizable determinant of anti-immigration votes, while the presence of culturally similar immigrants does not affect natives' voting behavior at all in most specifications. We argue that the differential impact of the two groups of immigrants is, at least in part, driven by natives' concerns about compositional amenities. We finally find that the share of right-wing votes in favor of the Swiss People's Party appears to be more elastic with respect to the share of culturally different immigrants than natives' attitudes themselves, suggesting that the party has gained a disproportionate vote share from attitudinal changes caused by immigrant inflows.","[Brunner, Beatrice] ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Gertrudstr 15, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Kuhn, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Kirchlindachstr 79, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Brunner, B (通讯作者)，ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Gertrudstr 15, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland.",beatrice.brunner@zhaw.ch; andreas.kuhn@ehb.swiss,,"Brunner, Beatrice/0000-0002-6010-5184",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (The Austrian Center for Labor Economics and the Analysis of the Welfare State) [S10304-G16],Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (The Austrian Center for Labor Economics and the Analysis of the Welfare State),"We thank Armin Falk, Andrea Ichino, Rafael Lalive, Kevin Lang, Rainer Winkelmann, Josef Zweimuller, an anonymous referee, participants at the 11th IZA Annual Migration Meeting 2014 in Bonn as well as seminar participants in Lausanne and Zurich for many helpful comments and suggestions.

We develop an agent based model to simulate the process of knowledge diffusion that undergirds household behaviour choices. The model is patterned on a rural community in southern Laos and is applied to simulating three development initiatives actually implemented there. The first initiative involves a program to encourage school attendance, the second a campaign to introduce safe water handling practices, and the third an investment in a feeder road to facilitate engagement with markets. The simulation exercise starts with an infusion effort that recruits specific households, then traces the diffusion process through social networks defined by shared activities. The decision to adopt a change in behaviour is based on the relative influence of adoptees vs non-adoptees within a household's network. Further, the degree to which a household opting to change its behaviour effectively realizes a change also depends on the influence of its social network. In actual fact, the education initiative failed in the Lao community while the initiatives involving water practices and market engagement were successful. Our model helps to understand these outcomes in light of the way the initiatives were promulgated within a community social structure. Crown Copyright (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hence, shifts in production locations within global sectors, possibly caused by environmental regulations, are likely to have an impact on aggregated energy usage and emissions. Applying a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition we decompose changes of sectoral energy use from 2001-2011 into three effects: (sectoral) value added, energy efficiency and delocalization, which in this paper is conceived as a structural effect within sectors, between regions. Our results show that although economic activity and technological progress dominate global energy use developments, for most sectors a delocalization towards less efficient production places is ongoing. It contributes to annual increases in energy use in the range of 1-6%. Especially, manufacturing sectors, which are among the most energy consuming sectors, reveal significant increases in energy usage due to delocalization since 2004. This development is accompanied by declining energy intensity improvement rates, indicating that delocalization induces second order effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The HHA-level data were augmented with county-level area characteristics for each HHA in the CMS database. An ordered logit model was used to estimate the association between state CON restrictions and Low, Medium, and High quality categories, adjusted for HHA and area characteristics. The results indicated that HHAs in states with CON for HHAs were less likely to have High quality ratings, and more likely to have Medium quality ratings, compared to agencies in states without CON for home health.

In addition, following the approach of Salisu and Isah (2018), we extend the oil-based bivariate framework of WN (2015) to a multi-predictor set-up in order to augment the traditional Phillips curve-based inflation model with the proposed cost-push factor. Using the OECD countries, we demonstrate that the forecast performance of the traditional Phillips curve tends to improve when it is augmented with oil price both for the in-sample and out-of sample forecasts. Contrary to the prominent findings in the literature, the augmented Phillips curve model outperforms the first order autoregressive model.

This paper studies the effect of economic integration on governance practices within firms. I propose a theory of endogenous corporate governance investments in industry equilibrium with monopolistic competition. Firms can use investments into better corporate governance as a cheap substitute to performance compensation to mitigate agency problems. International integration alters the demand for managers in the economy such that firms may reduce their corporate governance investments and offer higher performance payments. This globalization-induced deterioration of corporate governance in the economy diminishes the welfare gains from globalization. Using data on governance practices in U.S. manufacturing corporations, I provide empirical evidence that conforms to the model predictions. Firms in industries that experienced substantial trade liberalization between 1990 and 2006 have changed their governance practices allowing for more managerial slack and offered higher equity payments to their CEOs. These effects are particularly large in relatively dynamic industries that are characterized by large exit rates.

This article examines the impacts of the caterpillar fungus boom on Tibetan pastoralists' current-day livelihood and the prospects of their future economic development. Our study is based on a household survey conducted in 2016 covering 58 villages across the Tibetan autonomous land area. Results show that the new stream of cash income from gathering and trading caterpillar fungus has had a strong short-term welfare-improving effect. Household consumption, healthcare spending, and religious charity have risen sharply with caterpillar fungus income. Unfortunately, the fungus boom has not brought about productive investment or human capital accumulation that is conducive to long-term growth. Rather, the resource windfall has created disincentives for school attendance, nonfarm labor participation, and productivity improvements in pastoralism.

The analysis shows BTIO's inability to capture the consumer-principle throughout the production chain and its inadequacy as an option for consumption-based accounting, because it allocates emissions to the first importing country and to the sector of production, instead to the consumer (both country and region). Regarding the BTA assessment, BTIO tax domestic carbon content of direct imports, but not indirect imported carbon content. MRIO does provide incentives for mitigation in third countries.

We derive a conceptual model showing how the level and variability of price perceptions outside the task at hand might affect choice behavior, and we conduct an experiment to test the model by manipulating information provided to respondents in a way to alter the outside the experiment perceptions. Mixed logit, error component models show that reference-dependent models best describe the choice data, and we find that consumer choice is significantly affected by the experiment manipulations. The predictions of the model are borne out in the data. As expected, price sensitivity is generally higher for price changes above a price reference point than below. Also as predicted, exogenously increasing external reference prices and exogenously reducing the variability in references prices both serve to increase the probability of making a purchase and reduce the probability of choosing none. These results have important implications for the design and practice of choice experiments, as they show that consumer choice is affected by perceptions of the level and variability of prices outside the experiment. More generally, the results highlight the need to understand the formation and distribution of reference prices when predicting consumer choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find the same results as the previous literature for the determinants of banking and debt crises but substituting external and public debt with perpetual debt and where perpetual debt has a less important role than crises in the private sector. Moreover, we find evidence in favour of the hypothesis that currency crises depend strongly and positively on financial centre crises and negatively and mildly on perpetual debt.

The aim of this contribution is to examine how this modification in the second model affects the amount of information needed to properly identify its parameters. At first, I shortly introduce main aspects of both models. Based on the presented calibration, trajectories of main endogenous variables are obtained.

Applying continuously-updated fully modified panel estimation, we find that industrial electricity consumption has a significantly larger impact on economic prosperity than physical and human capital investment. Industrial electricity consumption plays a dominant role to boost growth in the center and the west, while human capital contributes most to the growth of the east. And notably, core cities are the largest beneficiaries from the growth of production inputs. Accounting for heterogeneity and cross-section dependence, results from the Granger non-causality tests suggest that the implementation of electricity-saving strategy is more feasible in inland China without hampering the economic growth and development of human capital. In the east, regulators must make efforts to increase investment in building electricity infrastructure to connect demand with supply to avoid shortage of power having an adverse effect on economic growth. Reducing the urban-rural gap in electricity tariffs and improving development of rural electricity network are rationalized to achieve sustainable economic development for the urban community in China.","[Chen, Yang] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Fang, Zheng] Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Business, 461 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599491, Singapore",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS),"Fang, Z (通讯作者)，Singapore Univ Social Sci, Sch Business, 461 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599491, Singapore.",yang.chen@xjtlu.edu.cn; fangzheng@suss.edu.sg,"Fang, Zheng/H-4201-2019","Fang, Zheng/0000-0002-8622-8959",,,,,72,41,42,2,38,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This study's main contribution is to demonstrate the combined utility of mediation and UN peacekeeping. Mediation builds trust and confidence and works with the parties to design an efficacious agreement conducive to, among other features, tamping down post-agreement violence. Peacekeeping stems violence and facilitates the implementation of the agreement. Agreements that are mediated and followed by UN peacekeeping are expected to be more robust in terms of staving off violence. We report the effects of the mediation-peacekeeping interaction using a method correcting for a common misinterpretation of interaction terms. We test logit and hazard models using a sample of full and partial civil war peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011. Controlling for agreement design, democracy, and income per capita, the results indicate mediation and its interaction with peacekeeping reduce the probability of renewed/continuing violence and have a positive impact on agreement duration.

Our iterative estimation approach explicitly analyses the role of time in price determination. The results show that both spatio-temporal components should be included in model specification; past transaction information stops contributing to price determination after eight months; and limited temporal friction is exhibited within this period.

We simulate the impact of a ban and show that the potential health benefits are partially offset by firms lowering prices and by consumer switching to other junk foods.","[Dubois, Pierre] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Griffith, Rachel; O'Connell, Martin] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Griffith, Rachel] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Manchester,"Griffith, R (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Griffith, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",rgriffith@ifs.org.uk,"Griffith, Rachel S/A-2583-2009; Dubois, Pierre/R-8768-2019","Griffith, Rachel S/0000-0002-8616-5820; Dubois, Pierre/0000-0002-9077-6843","European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2009-AdG-249529, ERC-2015-AdG-694822]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) [RES-544-28-0001]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Open Research Area (ORA) [ES/I012222/1]; ANR under Open Research Area (ORA) [ANR-10-ORAR-009-01]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/I012222/1, ES/N018788/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I012222/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Open Research Area (ORA)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ANR under Open Research Area (ORA)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the European Research Council (ERC) under ERC-2009-AdG-249529 and ERC-2015-AdG-694822, from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP), grant number RES-544-28-0001 and under the Open Research Area (ORA) grant number ES/I012222/1 and from ANR under Open Research Area (ORA) grant number ANR-10-ORAR-009-01.",,71,44,47,5,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The analysis begins with the presentation of the demands of the Trump Administration to renegotiate the Agreement and estimates of the tariff effects - in Mexico and the United States-of a cancellation of NAFTA, emphasizing the footwear value-added chain. In general, the effects of a cancellation of NAFTA are not significant from a tariff perspective, although a group of value-added chains and items will indeed have an impact on their activities in the region. Starting from relative high levels of integration in the North American region, since the beginning of the 21st century there is an increasing disintegration; the footwear value-added chain is an example of this process. The document presents a group of proposals - and beyond the current renegotiation process-in order to reflect the massive challenges for the productive Mexican sector in the context of NAFTA, from a local, national and regional perspectives.","[Dussel Peters, Enrique] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Dussel Peters, Enrique] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Estudios China Mexico Cechimex, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Peters, ED (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;Peters, ED (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Estudios China Mexico Cechimex, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",dussel@unam.mx,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,5,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

To distinguish which is the empirically more relevant case, I analyze the effect of importing intermediate inputs on the labor composition using matched employer-employee data and information on trade transactions from the universe of Brazilian firms. Propensity score matching indicates that an intermediate import expansion at the extensive margin leads to employment growth, higher intensities in routine and non-routine manual tasks and an increased share of intermediates exports. These findings thus point out that Brazil's intermediate imports predominantly represent onshored tasks. This result holds regardless of whether intermediate imports from high- or low-wage countries are considered. In line with theoretical considerations, the data show that Brazil's comparative advantage is in medium-complex and routine manual intensive production stages.","[Ehrl, Philipp] Univ Catolica Brasilia, Grad Program Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade Catolica de Brasilia,"Ehrl, P (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Brasilia, Grad Program Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",philipp.ehrl@ucb.br,,"Ehrl, Philipp/0000-0002-6661-8976",DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst) [D/12/41858],DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst) [grant number D/12/41858].,,55,5,5,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper gives the answers for the following questions: How do China's final demands trigger the growth of its imports from Korea? And what's the impact of China's final demands on the import in different industries? Design/methodology/approach Based on the Multi-Regional Input-Output model and World Input-Output Table database, this paper constructs the non-competitive imports input-output (IO) table of China to Korea. According to this table, we can calculate the induced imports coefficient and comprehensive induced import coefficients of China's four final demands for imports from Korea in the 56 industries in China. Findings Among the four driving forces, the strongest one is changes in inventories and valuables. The impact of final consumption expenditure and fixed capital formation is much lower than that of changes in inventories and valuables, but they have a broader impact for the 56 industries. This paper finds out the China's import induction of the final demands to Korea peaked in 2005 and 2010 and decreased greatly in 2014, so the position of China as market provider for Korea will no longer rise substantially, contrarily it will be in a steady state. Originality/value First, this paper constructs the non-competitive IO table to analyze the market provider issues between two countries and provides practical ways and methods for studies on the issues of imports and market provider. Second, this paper investigates the different roles of four final demands on driving force of China as market provider for Korea and the structural changes of China as a market provider for Korea among 56 industries from 2000 to 2014.","[Feng, Yongqi] Jilin Univ, Econ Sch, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianshu] Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University,"Zhang, TS (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zhangtianshu1983@126.com,"zhang, tian/GZK-6001-2022",,,,,,21,2,2,0,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Do similar incumbency effects exist in more party-centered environments? We estimate incumbency effects in an open-list proportional representation system, exploiting that seats are first allocated across parties, and then to candidates within party lists. Using data from Norwegian local elections 2003-2015, we document that a candidate that barely wins a seat in the local council has about a 9 percentage points (43%) higher probability of being elected in the next election compared to a candidate that just misses out on a seat on the same party list. We find no evidence that voters contribute to this personal incumbency advantage. Rather, it seems as if party elites are instrumental in securing the electoral success of their party affiliates. We show that incumbents and non-incumbents run again in the subsequent election at about equal rates, but that incumbents tend to advance in the party hierarchy and obtain safer ballot positions in future elections, which is what ultimately leads to electoral success.

The input variables of most of the studies are traditional technical indicators which are used by professional traders to implement investment strategies. We analyse if these indicators have predictive power on the German DAX-30 stock index by applying a hybrid fuzzy neural network to predict the one-day ahead direction of index. We implement different models depending on whether all the indicators and oscillators are used as inputs, or if a linear combination of them obtained through a factor analysis is used instead.

An explanation for the occurrence of this effect is that consumers try to escape the higher cognitive effort that is associated with making an active choice in large menus. Building on this explanation, we propose and analyse a model of duopolistic competition where firms compete in menu design in the presence of a consumer population with heterogeneous preferences and overload menu-size thresholds. The firms' strategic trade-off is between offering a large menu in order to match the preferences of as many consumers as possible, and offering a small menu in order to avoid losing choice-overloaded consumers to their rival or driving them out of the market altogether. We study the equilibrium outcomes in this market and establish some (im)possibility results and characterizations under a variety of assumptions. We also propose a measure of market effectiveness that may be thought of as a proxy for consumer welfare in this environment, and use it alongside our model to provide a critical perspective on regulations that cap the number of products that firms could offer.

It is found that there is substantial time variation in the Okun's coefficient in the US. Since the Great Recession, a given unemployment gap has been associated with a smaller output gap. The probability that the Okun's coefficient is equal to the widely accepted value of 2 fell significantly during the Great Recession, but has since risen despite the Okun's coefficient remaining at around -0.5.

In November of 2016, voters in Louisiana rejected Amendment 2, a constitutional amendment that would have given state institutions of higher education autonomy in setting tuition. We examine parish-level voting on Amendment 2 using an empirical political economy model and find that parishes with a greater percentage of African-Americans and university employees were more likely to vote yes. Student enrolment at public institutions seemingly did not play a role in Amendment 2 losing.","[Hall, Joshua C.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Karadas, Serkan] Sewanee, Dept Econ, Sewanee, TN USA",West Virginia University; Sewanee: University of the South,"Hall, JC (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",joshua.c.hall@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This result implies that, as the wage quantile moves from lower to higher levels, female professionals in arts and culture jobs face significant barriers to career advancement.

In particular, using panel data from 2007 to 2014, we examine the resilience of banks in the BRICS economies. Our results suggest that a 10% increase in capital adequacy ratio (CAR), Tier 1 capital ratio (TRA), and leverage ratio (LEV), the resilience (as measured by Z-Score of banks) increases by about 2.18, 0.89 and 1.31%, respectively. Similarly, for a 100% increase in liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), the resilience of banks increases by 0.51%, 1.10% and 1.19%, respectively, in the models associated with CAR, TRA, and LEV. Hence, our findings suggest that the CAR is robust to increase the resilience of banks. Our study also reveals that the LCR and LEV are the most effective to increase the resilience of banks if implemented simultaneously. We also find that the stage of economic development does not matter in formulating policies for the BRICS economies, and finally, we provide empirical evidence that economy-wide risk, such as a financial crisis, does not affect the resilience of banks and it influences the resilience of banks in the BRICS economies in the same way before and after the crisis.","[Hossain, Md Zakir] Curtin Univ & Technol, Dept Finance & Banking, Sarawak Campus, Miri, Malaysia; [Khan, Md Atiqur Rahman; Sadique, M.

This type of temptation is ubiquitous, as it refers to any temptation that is present until one either gives in or makes a costly commitment decision to have it removed. Subjects in our experiment are repeatedly offered an option with instantaneous benefit that also entails a substantial reduction to overall earnings. We show that this option is tempting in the sense that a substantial fraction of our subjects incur pecuniary costs to eliminate the choice, and thus commit not to choose this alternative. We find that commitment and giving in to temptation generally occur at the first opportunity, though a non-negligible fraction of subjects delay either making the commitment decision or giving in to temptation. This delay is consistent with the costs of self-control increasing with its use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Strategies related to cloud auditing provider evaluation and improvement planning are inherently multiple attribute decision making (MADM) issues and are very important to the auditor industry. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an evaluation and improvement planning model to be a reference for CPA firms selecting the best cloud auditing provider, and illustrates an application of such a model through an empirical case study. The DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) approach is first used to analyze the interactive influence relationship map (IIRM) between the criteria and dimensions of cloud auditing technology. DANP (DEMATEL-based ANP) is then employed to calculate the influential weights of the dimensions and criteria. Finally, the modified VIKOR method is utilized to provide improvement priorities for performance cloud auditing provider satisfaction. Based on expert interviews, the recommendations for improvement priorities are privacy, security, processing integrity, availability, and confidentiality. This approach is expected to support the auditor industry to systematically improve their cloud auditing provider selection.","[Hu, Kuang-Hua] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Accounting Sch, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hu, Kuang-Hua] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Finance & Accounting Res Ctr, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chen, Fu-Hsiang] Chinese Culture Univ, Sch Accounting, Dept & Grad, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Urban Planning, Coll Publ Affairs, New Taipei, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Culture University; National Taipei University,"Chen, FH (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Sch Accounting, Dept & Grad, Taipei, Taiwan.",chenfuhsiang1@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 107-2410-H-034-016]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors are extremely grateful for the reviewers and journal editorial team's valuable comments on improving the quality of this research.

For this reason we consider the problem of selecting the most appropriate MILP formulation for a certain type of decision maker as a multi-criteria decision making problem and present an integrated AHP-TOPSIS decision making methodology to select the most appropriate formulation. As an example the proposed decision making methodology is implemented on the selection of the MILP formulations of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). A numerical example is provided for illustrative purposes. As a result, the proposed decision model can be a tool for the decision makers (here they are the scientists, engineers and practitioners) who intend to choose the appropriate mathematical model(s) among the alternatives according to their needs on their studies. The integrated AHP-TOPSIS approach can simply be incorporated into a computer-based decision support system since it has simplicity in both computation and application.","[Kececi, Baris; Derya, Tusan; Dinler, Esra; Ic, Yusuf Tansel] Baskent Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Eskisehir Yolu,20 Km, TR-06810 Ankara, Turkey",Ministry of Energy & Natural Resources - Turkey; Baskent University,"Ic, YT (通讯作者)，Baskent Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Eskisehir Yolu,20 Km, TR-06810 Ankara, Turkey.",ytansel@baskent.edu.tr,"Keçeci, Barış/AAC-4793-2019; iç, Yusuf Tansel/AGQ-5008-2022; IC, YUSUF TANSEL/AGE-3003-2022; Kececi, Baris/F-1639-2011; iç, Yusuf Tansel/AAI-1081-2020","Keçeci, Barış/0000-0002-2730-5993; IC, YUSUF TANSEL/0000-0001-9274-7467;",,,,,75,2,2,0,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Firm heterogeneity in productivity sources conveys more information about firm-specific differences in productivity. In this regard, large firms are more productive, largely because they are more innovative, despite being slow to catch up during booms or operating at a less-than-efficient scale. We find that the beneficial impact of exports on productivity is most evident when firms become exporters, and intrafirm trade causes enough inefficiency to offset the salutary effects of trade after a certain threshold.

At the same time, we focus on the changes of the market risk and co-movements of the Baltic and the European markets returns in time. The aim of the paper is to find the frequencies and time when volatility and co-movements change. We use monthly data in the period of 2000-2017. The wavelet analysis was employed to segregate the risk and co-movements at different time and different frequencies. Compared to previous studies, a novelty of the paper is the investigation of the markets at each time horizon separately. Our findings are consistent with the findings of other researchers who indicated that the Baltic markets are more integrated with the developed European stock markets during crisis periods. We have found some impact of accession to the EU on co-movements between the Baltic equity markets and the European market. We have discovered that co-movements are greater in low frequencies. From the investment diversification point of view, the effect depends on the investment horizon. Our conclusion is that for the investor with a time horizon of over 1.5 years diversification with the Baltic markets is not very efficient.","[Kregzde, Arvydas] Vilnius Univ, Naugarduko 24, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Kregzde, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Naugarduko 24, Vilnius, Lithuania.",arvydas.kregzde@mif.vu.lt,,,,,,,41,4,4,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Despite commonly held negative perceptions, the available evidence indicates that HFT and algorithmic trading may have several beneficial effects on markets. However, these types of trading may cause instabilities in financial markets in specific circumstances. Carefully chosen regulatory measures are needed to address concerns in the shorter term. However, further work is needed to inform policies in the longer term, particularly in view of likely uncertainties and lack of data.

The impact of leverage on intraday liquidity (spread and depth) is analysed in two periods - one of normal volatility and the other of abnormal/high volatility. There is a significant difference in spread and depth of leveraged and unleveraged ETFs in periods of both normal volatility and high volatility; however, this difference is more pronounced in higher volatility periods. In high volatility periods, liquidity typically diminishes in all ETFs, and this is even more so for the leveraged ETFs. When leveraged ETFs are segregated into multiples based on their power to replicate the underlying benchmark (i.e. multiples of -3, -2, -1, 2, 3), the difference in spreads between normal and high volatility periods is typically larger. The double-leveraged ETF has the most significant difference between the positive and negative counter parts. However, the relationship in the progression of the multiples does not change linearly to correspond with the level of volatility. This may be due to the nonlinear relation between volume and volatility. We shed light on the magnification effect of financial leverage on microstructure of the ETFs.","[March-Dallas, Samique] Florida A&M Univ, Sch Business & Ind, Tallahassee, FL 32307 USA; [Daigler, Robert; Mishra, Suchi; Prakash, Arun] Florida Int Univ, Coll Business Adm, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida A&M University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Mishra, S (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Coll Business Adm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",mishras@fiu.edu,,"Mishra, Suchi/0000-0002-1715-3279",,,,,22,4,4,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, major authorities in economic science (from A. Smith to R. Coase) agreed that efficient regulation is needed to reduce frictions and promote trade. Particularly legal services demonstrate numerous forms of inefficiencies, requiring a thorough microeconomic evaluation before optimising the regulation. The highly polarised market is split in two segments with regulation mostly needed at its bottom. Our longitudinal study of Slovenian legal offices population mainly rejects the private capture hypothesis and exposes political risks of regulation, which might lead to the tragedy of commons. Imposed lawyer's tariff freeze since 2003 paradoxically hurts the pillars of a network warranting physical and economic accessibility of legal services for most vulnerable groups. We estimate that the lawyer's tariff in Slovenia is undervalued almost by half, but only a slow increase can be expected due to political costs and fiscal effects. Dismal perspectives for lawyer's profession divert capable new entrants to start the career, causing long-term gap in labour supply. Thus, we concentrated on modelling the minimum requirements for a financially viable network coverage in order to support positive externalities.","[Mlinaric, Franjo; Oplotnik, Zan Jan] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Brezovnik, Bostjan] Univ Maribor, Fac Law, Mladinska Ul 9, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Mlinaric, F (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",franjo.mlinaric@um.si; zan.oplotnik@um.si; bostjan.brezovnik@um.si,"Oplotnik, Zan J/B-4546-2013","Brezovnik, Bostjan/0000-0001-8297-9862; Oplotnik, Zan Jan/0000-0001-5579-2955",,,,,32,1,1,0,4,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

As services that require heavy data traffic and QoS guarantees are launched, a policy that promotes virtuous circulation between ISPs and application service providers (ASPs) is necessary for the development of all Internet-related industries.","[Na, Ho Seoung; Hwang, Junseok] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Daeho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Interact Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Changjun] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore, Singapore",Seoul National University (SNU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); National University of Singapore,"Lee, C (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore, Singapore.",sppleec@nus.edu.sg,"Changjun, Lee/AAG-3168-2020","Changjun, Lee/0000-0002-8859-9796; Na, Ho Seoung/0000-0002-4416-0212",,,,,48,5,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Therefore, this paper aims to analyse the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission channels in restraining inflation in case of Vietnam for 2001-2015. The use of a Vector Error Correction Model yields evidence that credit growth is the key determinant of high inflation. Additionally, the results suggest the interest rate channel has a perverse effect on inflation in the long run, which means that the inflation rate increases with the policy rate. There is also significant short-run causal relationship from credit growth to inflation, and from the policy rate to inflation. However, empirical results fail to confirm the existence of relationship between the exchange rate channel and inflation in both short run and long run.","[Ngan Tran] Banking Acad, Dept Banking, Hanoi, Vietnam",,"Tran, N (通讯作者)，Banking Acad, Dept Banking, Hanoi, Vietnam.",ngantt@hvnh.edu.vn,,,,,,,42,3,3,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We mainly focus on output responses with regards to the sign of the government spending shock. We first develop a simple theoretical model where we show how government spending interacts with financial conditions. More specifically, a contractionary policy worsens financial conditions while an expansionary policy eases them, affecting the size of the government spending multiplier. Our subsequent empirical analysis suggests that the multiplier of a negative spending shock is higher during financially stressful periods. A reduction in government spending during these periods has a large, negative, and long-lasting effect on output with a long-run multiplier of 1.79. On the other hand, an increase in government spending results to a multiplier of 1.19. In contrast, during financially tranquil periods, government spending multipliers are close to zero for both a positive and a negative shock. The main policy implication drawn from our findings is in favour of building up fiscal adjusters in normal times or pursuing front-loaded structural reform policies to avoid fiscal contraction when it is more painful.","[Pragidis, I.

In particular, the model incorporates income shocks governed by a Wiener process with a mean of zero and standard deviation of unity as uncertainty. We analyze how uncertainty and population size affect the supply of public goods. Dynamic analysis shows the importance of attitude toward risk and a contrast between short-run and long-run responses to increases in uncertainty and population size. Results show that under specified conditions, escalating uncertainty reduces the long-run contributions to public goods through the stochastic accumulation of capital but it raises short-run contributions. The average contribution increases to a positive finite value by increasing the population to a certain level, but it declines toward zero if the population size is infinite. These twin results are based on the dynamic behaviors of risk-averse individuals responding to elevated risks.","[Tamai, Toshiki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Tamai, T (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",tamai@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Tamai, Toshiki/J-2151-2016","Tamai, Toshiki/0000-0001-7524-5545",JSPS KAKENHI [16K03726]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03726] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to Yoshiyasu Ono, Yoshitomo Ogawa and seminar participants at Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University and Nagoya University for their valuable advice and comments.

We examined both the impact of the pattern of growth on poverty and inequality (the growth-inequality-poverty (G-I-P) nexus); and the less studied reverse causal chain emanating from poverty to subsequent inequality and growth (the poverty-inequality-growth (P-I-G) nexus). For the G-I-P nexus, we found that poverty reduction is becoming more responsive to income growth and improvement in inequality in SSA in the post-2007 years; though the responsiveness remains smaller in SSA than in the developing world (with or without SSA) throughout the three decades examined. For the P-I-G nexus, we found that SSA again differs from the rest of the developing world in that SSA countries with the highest initial poverty incidence appeared to grow subsequently faster-leading to poverty convergence; while the developing world (with or without SSA) experienced a lack of poverty convergence during the same time period. We hypothesise that the main cause of poverty convergence in SSA during 1978-2007 might be due to anti-poverty interventions by governments and foreign public and private aid inversely proportional to the depth of poverty.","[Thorbecke, Erik] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Ouyang, Yusi] Univ Tulsa, Dept Econ, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA",Cornell University; University of Tulsa,"Ouyang, YS (通讯作者)，Univ Tulsa, Dept Econ, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.",yusi-ouyang@utulsa.edu,,,African Development Bank,African Development Bank(CGIAR),The authors would like to thank Augustin Fosu and the anonymous referees for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Firms that innovate must adapt complementary inputs, and are ex ante uncertain about whether adaptations will be costly and whether they will infringe other patents. If adaptation requires undiscovered technology, then the firm faces a direct cost but never infringes another firm's patent. If adaptation requires technology previously discovered by another firm, then the firm faces no direct cost but may infringe another firm's patent and pay a licensing royalty. The main analysis considers the desirability and feasibility of having some firms specialize in discovery and patenting-that is, behave as non-practicing entitieswhile other firms innovate. I find that non-practicing entities increase welfare only if the cost of discovery and patenting is sufficiently low. But if royalties are too high, then too many firms choose to be non-practicing entities instead of innovating, and welfare is higher without them. If litigation is costly, then it may be optimal to deter non-practicing entities by eliminating patents for discoveries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A large body of literature has analyzed these phenomena separately, but little has been done to see whether there is a link between them. We employ a macroeconomic model for a small open economy with a large input-output core to analyze how deunionization may cause job polarization. Our analysis shows that medium-skilled workers are negatively affected by deunionization, mainly as a result of the heterogeneity of the elasticities of substitution between different types of labor. While the elasticities of substitution between high- and medium-skilled labor are relatively low, the elasticities of substitution between medium- and low-skilled are relatively high. As a result, when deunionization leads to increased wage dispersion, we find that demand for low-skilled increases at the expense of medium-skilled labor, thus yielding a more polarized labor market.","[Von Brasch, Thomas; Sparrman, Victoria] Stat Norway Res Dept, Unit Macroecon, Oslo, Norway; [Gjelsvik, Marit Linnea] Norwegian Union Commerce & Off Employees, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Von Brasch, T; Sparrman, V (通讯作者)，Stat Norway Res Dept, Unit Macroecon, Oslo, Norway.",vonbrasch@gmail.com; Victoria.Sparrman@ssb.no,,,"Ministry of Education and Research; Ministry of Health and Care Services; Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries; Research Council of Norway (NFR)","Ministry of Education and Research; Ministry of Health and Care Services; Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries; Research Council of Norway (NFR)(Research Council of Norway)","This paper has been financed by the Ministry of Education and Research, Ministry of Health and Care Services, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries.

The government faces fiscal constraints; it cannot adjust tax rates or impose lump-sum taxes on the private sector, but it can adjust public consumption and foreign debt. When foreign debt is sufficiently high, however, the government can choose to default to increase domestic public and private consumption by freeing up the resources used to pay the debt. Two types of defaults arise in this environment: fiscal defaults and aggregate defaults. Fiscal defaults occur because of the government's inability to raise tax revenues. Aggregate defaults occur even if the government could raise tax revenues; debt is simply too high to be sustainable. In a quantitative exercise calibrated to Greece, we find that our model can predict the recent default, but that increasing taxes would not have prevented it. In fact, increasing taxes would have made the recession deeper because of the distortionary effects of taxation.","[Arellano, Cristina] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA; [Arellano, Cristina] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Arellano, Cristina] NBER, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bai, Yan] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY USA; [Bai, Yan] NBER, Rochester, NY USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Rochester; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Arellano, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA.;Arellano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Arellano, C (通讯作者)，NBER, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",arellano.cristina@gmail.com; yanbai06@gmail.com,,"Bai, Yan/0000-0001-5149-2197","National Science Foundation [1024581]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1024581] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",The views expressed herein are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.

The novelty of this approach is that we explicitly acknowledge differences in the value of in-kind transfers resulting from cross-regional variations in service quality. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we adopt a fiscal federalism approach to assess the distributional implications of adding health public expenditure to the disposable income of Italian households and we compare the distributional results across regions. We then take a yardstick competition approach to evaluate the distributional implications of accounting for the quality and efficiency of services. To analyze the distributional impact of health public expenditure, we show the difference of the Gini index between final income and disposable income for each region and the progressivity index (Kakwani index). The re-ranking effect and the average in-kind benefit rate (that is the ratio of total in-kind transfers to disposable income) are also computed. Our analysis provides convincing evidence that when health services are evaluated at production cost, in-kind benefits reduce overall inequality on the distribution of disposable income. However, this effect is seen to be lower when the yardstick competition approach is applied to account for quality and cost-effectiveness, and, more importantly, it shows a geographical pattern.","[Bianchini, Laura] Dept Transportat, Santa Fe, NM USA; [Piazza, Santino] IRES Piemonte, Turin, Italy; [Cassone, Alberto] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, POLIS, Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Cassone, A (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Choice, POLIS, Alessandria, Italy.",alberto.cassone@uniupo.it,,"CASSONE, Alberto/0000-0002-2655-9959",Universita del Piemonte Orientale local research fund,Universita del Piemonte Orientale local research fund,"This research was partially funded by Universita del Piemonte Orientale local research fund.

To this end we construct a small open economy model with financial frictions, where housing loans can be denominated in domestic or foreign currency. The model is calibrated for Poland - a typical small open economy with a large share of foreign currency loans (FCL). We show that the presence of FCLs negatively affects the transmission of monetary policy and deteriorates the output-inflation volatility trade-off it faces. The trade-off can be improved with macroprudential policy but the outcomes are still worse than under this same policy,mix applied to an economy with domestic currency debt. We also demonstrate that a high share of FCLs is harmful for social welfare, even if financial stability considerations are not taken into account. Finally, we show that regulatory policies that discriminate against FCLs may have a negative impact on economic activity and discuss the redistributive consequences of forced currency conversion of household debt.

To this end, we draw on a novel dataset of firm liquidations from Slovenia and exploit courts' de facto random assignment of firm liquidation cases to licensed liquidation trustees. We find that only a subset of the observed liquidation trustee characteristics matters for only a subset of examined firm liquidation outcomes. The trustee's experience affects the length of proceedings.

For this, we conduct the Asymmetric Dynamic Conditional Correlation -EGARCH model, which captures asymmetries both in the conditional variances and correlations. Our main results suggest the upward patterns of correlations, reflecting the increased equity market integration over time, and also provide that asymmetric behavior in the correlations is not as common as in the volatilities. We further analyze time-paths of the correlations during the two latest crises; namely global financial crisis (GFC) and European Sovereign Debt Crisis to investigate whether the crises induce contagion effects and significant structural shifts. The empirical findings reveal that the correlation levels significantly increase and the emerging markets recouple in the latest two turmoil episodes, providing evidence of contagion incidences. Moreover, we examine whether the dynamic correlations possess abrupt changes in times of the crisis via multiple structural breakpoint tests and demonstrate that substantial regime shifts in the conditional correlations are present during both the GFC and the ESDC. Our results provide insights and have potential implications for global investors to optimize their portfolios as well as for authorities to handle contagion risk and prevent its adverse impacts.","[Demiralay, Sercan; Ulusoy, Veysel] Yeditepe Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University,"Demiralay, S (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Demiralay, Sercan/CAI-2118-2022; Demiralay, Sercan/ABC-1368-2020; Ulusoy, Veysel/V-3977-2017","Demiralay, Sercan/0000-0003-2543-7914; Demiralay, Sercan/0000-0003-2543-7914; Ulusoy, Veysel/0000-0001-7227-894X",,,,,85,4,5,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

It reviews efforts to apply developments in bank modeling to augmenting macroeconomic models during the 1960s through 1980s, theoretical and empirical elements that led to diminished emphasis on incorporating banking into analytical macroeconomic frameworks between the 1990s and the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and recently renewed work to integrate banking sectors into modern macroeconomic models.

Moreover, we perform panel Penn-effect regressions using a sample of 114 countries to prove that during the period 1970-2011 the four countries incurred misalignments of remarkable size and variability in their real exchange rates. All in all, our results reveal that for several decades the four countries needed to use their nominal exchange rate as a tool of macroeconomic adjustment. Since variations of the nominal exchange rate within the EMU are no longer an option, the four southern eurozone countries should accomplish the necessary structural reforms to avoid new and painful internal devaluations in the coming years.","[Garcia-Solanes, Jose] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Torrejon-Flores, Fernando] Univ Catolica Murcia, Murcia, Spain; [Rodenas-Monedero, Irene] Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain",University of Murcia; Universidad Catolica de Murcia; Banco de Espana,"García-Solanes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",pepgsolanes@gmail.com,,"Torrejon Flores, Fernando Edgar/0000-0002-6715-6734",Fundacion Seneca [15183/PHCS/10],Fundacion Seneca(Fundacion SenecaSpanish Government),"The authors thank the participants of the workshop European Economic Integration: Present and Future Challenges, ISEG-UL, Lisboa, 20-21 June 2014, for their helpful comments.

In this paper, we explore the impact of foreign bank presence on interest rate pass-through for a panel of 57 EMDEs over the period 1995-2009. Our empirical results suggest that there are strong threshold effects in terms of foreign bank presence and its impact on the strength of interest rate transmission. Foreign bank presence tends to re duce lending rates and enhance interest-rate pass-through in countries that have a relatively high degree of foreign bank presence compared to those with limited presence. On the other hand, foreign banks do not play any significant role in interest rate transmission in low threshold economies. We further find that the when foreign bank presence is associated with a decline in banking competition, it appears to lower the interest rate transmission. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, I engage with two questions. One, why and how was the century-old structure of English football so rapidly transformed and what were the consequences? Two, what sort of Marxian theoretical framework can we use to understand the historical trajectory of English football? With respect to the former, I follow David Harvey's analysis of neoliberal strategies used to restore upper-class dominance to argue that the formation of the EPL can be interpreted as another instance of accumulation by dispossession, one among myriad attempts to solve the profitability crisis of the 1970s by creating an avenue for financial speculation in football clubs. Together with the deregulation of television, it converted football from a domain formerly regarded as off-limits to the calculus of profitability into a business proper. In terms of a theoretical framework, I propose that it is useful to think of football as serving global capitalism in a dual manner: as an avenue for accumulation (the accumulation function) and as a tool for legitimizing capitalist rule by producing alienated consciousness in society (the legitimation function).","[Karak, Anirban] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 26 Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Karak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 26 Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",anirbankarak@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,2,3,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

State-contingent securities impact on banks' balance sheets through changes in their returns (and their prices), both of which depend on the current state of the economy. Non-state-contingent assets are signed before shocks are realized and their repayment is guaranteed. For this reason, they insulate banks' balance sheets from recent economic activity in the absence of defaults. Non-state-contingent assets in banks' balance sheets attenuate the amplification of shocks resulting from financial frictions. The same effect can be achieved if more weight is placed on the state-contingent assets in the equity related constraint against the costs of long-run output losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Participants took part in a repeated Bertrand duopoly game between three-player teams which had either the same or different levels of internal conflict (uniform vs. mixed). Profit division was either private-pay (high conflict; each member received her own asking price) or equal-pay (low conflict; profits were divided equally). We find that internal conflict leads to (tacit) coordination on high prices in uniform private-pay duopolies, but places private-pay teams at a competitive disadvantage in mixed duopolies. Competition is softened by transparency in uniform markets, but intensified in mixed markets. We propose an explanation of the results and discuss implications for managers and policy makers.

First, we provide an overview of the role that labor has played in China's economic success. We then describe China's hukou policy, which divides China's labor force into two distinct segments, one composed of rural workers and the other of urban workers. For the rural labor force, we focus on the challenges of raising human capital by both increasing basic educational attainment rates as well as the quality of education. For the urban labor force, we focus on the issues of further expanding enrollment in college education as well as improving the quality of college education. We use a regression model to show the typical relationship between human capital and output in economies around the world and demonstrate how that relationship has evolved since 1980. We show that China has made substantial strides both in the education level of its population and in the way that education is being rewarded in its labor markets. However, as we look ahead, our results imply that China may find it impossible to maintain what appears to be its desired growth rate of 7 percent in the next 20 years; a growth rate of 3 percent over the next two decades seems more plausible. Finally, we present policy recommendations, which are rooted in the belief that China continues to have substantial room to improve the human capital of its labor force.","[Li, Hongbin] Wuhan Univ, China Enterprise Survey Ctr, Inst Qual Dev Strategy, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongbin] Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Int Dev, Stanford Inst Econ Policy Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Loyalka, Prashant; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Loyalka, Prashant] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wu, Binzhen] Tsinghua Univ, Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Tsinghua University,"Li, HB (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, China Enterprise Survey Ctr, Inst Qual Dev Strategy, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.;Li, HB (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Int Dev, Stanford Inst Econ Policy Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lihongbinsem@gmail.com,"Loyalka, Prashant/Y-6174-2018; Wu, Binzhen/JQI-5598-2023",,,,,,43,121,140,9,227,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We introduce the general features of the SFC approach for a closed economy, showing how the core model has been extended to address issues such as financialization and income distribution. We next discuss the implications of the approach for models of open economies and compare the methodologies adopted in developing SFC empirical models for whole countries. We review the contributions where the SFC approach is being adopted as the macroeconomic closure of microeconomic agent-based models, and how the SFC approach is at the core of new research in ecological macroeconomics.

This requires the application of multi-criteria analysis, considering that policy-makers need to take into account a number of different aspects that, on the whole, indicate the quality of the banking system. Our aim is a comparative analysis of European banking systems right after the Brexit moment and within the framework of the tight new Basel III regulations. In this paper, we have ranked the banking systems of the 28 EU member states using multi-criteria analysis, specifically the PROMETHEE II method. The use of the PROMETHEE II method in combination with the entropy method offers a comprehensive insight into the banking system of each member state, given that the observed countries are ranked according to 9 conflicting criteria that are mostly used in banking system analysis. Our analysis shows that the banking systems in Central and Eastern Europe are the best performers, while the EMU's developed banking systems such as the German, Italian, British, and French one are positioned among the last ranked. The Portuguese and Greek banking systems are, as expected, ranked in the last positions in our list. The obtained results also pointed out that the ECB should change its approach to the management and further development of a European Banking Union.","[Radulescu, Magdalena] Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Studies, Pitesti, Arges County, Romania; [Fedajev, Aleksandra; Nikolic, Djordje] Univ Belgrade, Tech Fac Bor, Belgrade, Serbia",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; University of Belgrade,"Radulescu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Studies, Pitesti, Arges County, Romania.",youmagdar@yahoo.com; afedajev@tf.bor.ac.rs; djnikolic@tfbor.bg.ac.rs,"Fedajev, Aleksandra/K-5198-2019; Radulescu, Magdalena/AEW-0205-2022","Fedajev, Aleksandra/0000-0002-6974-6631; Nikolic, Djordje/0000-0002-9420-3612",,,,,66,7,7,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This is done in an OLG framework where parents decide on the number of children and the nutrition and secondary schooling of each child. Primary schooling is mandatory. Providing school meals locks countries with no children attending secondary schooling into poverty by reducing the private (nutrition) cost per child. In countries where parents find it optimal to enroll children in secondary schooling, food aid increases the marginal benefit of schooling. Consequently, school feeding programs are conducive to economic development in these countries. If food aid is in the form of a food price subsidy, we show that child nutrition and thus children's human capital increase unambiguously. Although fertility and schooling are not directly affected, a sufficiently high subsidy rate will induce parents to begin to enroll children into secondary schooling by the assumed complementarity between nutrition and schooling in the human capital production function. If the food aid program provides a fixed amount of food per child, this decreases the marginal benefit of parental nutritional investments; therefore, it leads to higher fertility and to lower total provision of nutrition per child.","[Vasilakis, Chrysovalantis] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Vasilakis, C (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Sch Hen Goleg, Bangor Business, Coll Rd, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales.",chvasilakis@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,3,3,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Our research provides one specific factor, the tariff reduction biased toward unskilled labor-intensive sectors, to explain and quantify the magnitudes of skill premium dynamics using the mandated-wage approach. The empirical evidence indicates that sector-biased tariff reductions have widened wage inequality in China through their effect on product prices. World price competition, on the other hand, has contributed to declining wage inequality via product prices, which is consistent with the endowment-based expectations of China's integration into the more skilled-labor abundant world.","[Xu, Yun; Ouyang, Alice Y.] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 S Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 S Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yunxu@cufe.edu.cn,,,China National Social Science Fund [16BJY167]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,China National Social Science Fund; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Comments on earlier versions from an anonymous referee of this journal are appreciated.

Using a quarterly index for business cycle synchronization by Cerqueira (Int Econ Econ Policy 10(3):349-363, 2013), our panel data estimates suggest that it is countries belonging to the core that are faced with increased synchronization among themselves after 2007Q4, whereas peripheral countries decreased synchronization with regards to the core, non-EMU countries and among themselves. Correlation coefficients and nonparametric local polynomial regressions corroborate these findings. The usual focus on co-movements and correlations might be misleading, however, since we also find large differences in the amplitude of national cycles. A strong common cycle can thus lead to large differences in cyclical positions even if national cycles are strongly correlated.","[Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar; Gros, Daniel] CEPS, Brussels, Belgium; [Belke, Ansgar] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Domnick, Clemens] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Chair Macroecon, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Duisburg Essen,"Domnick, C (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Econ, Chair Macroecon, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",clemens.domnick@gmail.com,,"Gros, Daniel/0000-0002-2911-8235",,,,,69,39,39,3,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The analysis rests on the theory of cumulative innovation, which shows that if IP rights on a pioneer invention extend to follow-on research and impediments to contracting exist, then strengthening patents can actually reduce overall innovation. Recent empirical studies are consistent with the theory: patents can significantly deter follow-on research in complex technology areas where contracting is difficult (computers, electronics, telecommunications) but not in drugs, chemicals and human genes. I outline remedies from court decisions and antitrust policy for addressing inefficiencies from patent trolling, patent thickets and the anti-commons of fragmented ownership. I then apply the analysis to the antibiotics market, drawing on recent research, to examine how patent and competition policies can be used to improve incentives for drug development in the battle against antibiotic resistance. The literature provides persuasive evidence that the policy changes overreached in broadening and strengthening IP rights and reveals important patent reforms for improving the effectiveness of patent systems in the US and Canada.","[Gallini, Nancy] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Gallini, N (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",nancy.gallini@ubc.ca,,,,,,,116,11,13,2,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Although capital may accumulate while labor emigrates early in the transition, the causal effect of immigration on capital investments and housing costs is positive.

This holds provided the choice variable is discrete rather than continuous; that is, the mapping from the realization of the exogenous variables to the endogenous ones is piece-wise constant. Thus, limited information is now a source of lumpiness in behavior, rather than a source of noise. The approach is applied to a simple static model of price-setting where individual price setters face aggregate monetary shocks and idiosyncratic productivity shocks. The effect of aggregate money shocks on output and prices is studied. It is shown that as the variance of idiosyncratic shocks become large, the aggregate log price level converges to a linear function of the aggregate money shock, with a coefficient which is strictly between 0 and 1. Consequently, unanticipated aggregate money shocks have real effects on output, in contrast to the sticky price model of Caplin and Spulber (1987). But these effects are smaller than in standard rational inattention models or in the Lucas (1972) misperception model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A new method for real-time monitoring exuberance in housing markets is proposed. By taking changes in the macroeconomic conditions (such as interest rate, per-capita income, employment, and population growth) into consideration, the new method provides better control for housing market fundamentals and thereby it is expected to significantly reduce the chance of false positive identification. Compared with the method of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b), the new approach finds a dramatic reduction in the number of speculative housing markets and shorter bubble episodes in the US. It locates only one bubble episode in the early-to-mid 2000s over the whole sample period in the national housing market. At the regional level, it identifies two periods of speculation: late 1980s and early-to-mid 2000s. The early-to-mid 2000s bubble episode lasts longer and involves 16 metropolitan statistical areas.","[Shi, Shuping] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Shi, Shuping] Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Macquarie University,"Shi, SP (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia.",shuping.shi@mq.edu.au,,"Shi, Shuping/0000-0001-8571-3066",,,,,33,48,52,3,53,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The conclusions and recommendations for mitigating the impact of insolvency in this paper would be useful for managers, public policy-makers and all stakeholders in companies with financial problems, as well as for financially still-healthy companies.","[Grdic, Zvonimira Sverko; Nizic, Marinela Krstinic; Mamula, Maja] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Opatija, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Grdic, ZS (通讯作者)，Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Opatija, Croatia.",zgrdic@fthm.hr,"Gregoric, Maja/N-7430-2018; Sverko Grdic, Zvonimira/T-4012-2018","Gregoric, Maja/0000-0001-6989-045X; Sverko Grdic, Zvonimira/0000-0002-9029-6487",,,,,34,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

As additional control variables, we also include currency reserves and effective exchange rates in our analysis. We distinguish between gross and net capital flows and also assess the impact of both FDI and portfolio flows. Accounting for the fact that common factors have been the main drivers of capital flows while country-specific determinants ('pull' factors) drive the response to such shocks, we analyze shocks to country groups but consider country-specific responses based on a Bayesian time-varying panel VAR framework in the spirit of Canova and Ciccarelli (2009). Based on a sample of 24 economies, our results show a robust positive effect of capital flows on GDP. Except for Korea, both gross and net capital flows display a positive impact for around two quarters. The impact of effective exchange rates on GDP hardly offers an explanation for a possible transmission of capital flow effects with effective depreciations both positively and negatively linked to GDP. We also find that the effect of net portfolio flows is even more positive compared to net FDI flows for emerging economies. Finally, we provide evidence that the importance of global factors increases in times of crises. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We then obtain a decomposition of coherent prices highlighting the role of bubbles. Eventually, we show that under very weak conditions, the coherent pricing of options implies a very clear representation which permits, as in Breeden and Litzenberger (J Bus 51:621-651, 1978), to extract the implied probability.","[Cassese, Gianluca] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Stat & Management, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Cassese, Gianluca] Univ Lugano, Via G Buffi 13, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland",University of Milano-Bicocca; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Cassese, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Stat & Management, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.;Cassese, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lugano, Via G Buffi 13, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",gianluca.cassese@unimib.it,"Cassese, Gianluca/AAG-3661-2019","Cassese, Gianluca/0000-0002-7127-7440",,,,,50,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Calibrating our model to the key aggregate and distributional moments of the U.S. economy for the period 1990-2015, we show that (i) the inclusion of infrastructure, and (ii) transitional dynamics between stationary states critically affect the characterization of the optimal level of public debt. Our results indicate that the inclusion of public infrastructure in the model specification implies a lower optimal debt level relative to the specification without infrastructure, both when comparing stationary equilibria and when accounting for transitional dynamics. When welfare comparisons are made by comparing stationary equilibria, we find that it is optimal for the government to accumulate assets (public surplus). However, once transitional dynamics are accounted for, accumulating debt becomes optimal, with the optimal share implied by our model being significantly higher than the average public debt-GDP ratio for the U.S. observed during our sample period.

In our setup, governments can choose proportional capital and labor income taxes subject to the constitutional constraint but cannot commit to an actual path of taxes. First, we explore a form of constitutional constraint: a constant cap on capital tax rates. In our quantitative exercise, we show that a three percent cap on capital taxes provides the highest welfare at the worst sustainable equilibrium. However, such a cap decreases welfare at the best sustainable equilibrium (both because it constrains feasibility and because it tightens the incentive compatibility constraint). Second, we identify a form of constitutional constraint that can improve all sustainable equilibria. That constraint features a cap on capital taxes that increases with the level of capital.","[Dominguez, Begona] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Feng, Zhigang] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Feng, Zhigang] Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",University of Queensland; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Nebraska System,"Domínguez, B (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Colin Clark Bldg 39, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",b.dominguez@uq.edu.au,,"Ma, Likun/0000-0001-6171-796X; Dominguez, Begona/0000-0002-2206-8079; Feng, Zhigang/0000-0002-5200-237X",NCCR-FINRISK,NCCR-FINRISK(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments.

In order to perform our empirical analysis, we estimate different growth models restricting the time frame to the first 15 years of the Euro - from 1999 to 2013. We find a positive impact of EU membership on economic growth, but no impact of being part of the EZ, except during the financial crisis, when the EZ has a negative impact on growth amongst its members.

We use firm-level data on R&D imports from foreign subsidiaries operating in Spain for the period 2005-2012, and a Eurobarometer measure of trust between citizens of European countries. We find that subsidiaries that belong to MNEs from countries with higher trust in Spaniards have fewer technology transfers within the business group and more from international market channels than subsidiaries from countries with lower trust in Spaniards.

Results show that mixed copula between t copula and the 270-degree rotated Clayton copula is the optimal fitting copula to measure dynamic dependence. The estimated time-varying Kendall coefficients indicate that WTI returns and OVX present negative dependence most of the time. There exists a structural change point of dependence between WTI returns and OVX changes on April 17, 2009, while the dependence characteristics within the subsamples are similar to that in the whole sample, indicating the rationality of our time-varying mixed copula models. Finally, the tests show significant risk spillover from OVX to WTI returns and also asymmetric effects for CoVaRs in response to different upside and downside extreme OVX movements.

I capitalize this motivation by generalizing the CoVaR approach proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) to allow it switching between a high and a normal risk regime filtered from data.. Considering the U.S. large bank holding companies (BHCs), this paper shows that modeling regime changes in tails is capable of capturing both amplification and mean-reversion effects of an adverse shock to a bank's balance sheet on the banking system. Using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test statistics with and without bootstrapping, I perform the significance test to identify systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), and the stochastic dominance test to rank the identified SIFIs. The stochastic dominance test raises the concern that the CoVaR measure underestimates systemic risk contributions for SIFIs but overestimates for non-SIFIs. Finally, applying the BHCs' characteristics and housing market price to forecast the regime-switching systemic risk out-of-sample, I obtain from 4 and 8-quarter-ahead horizons a desirable countercyclical, forward-looking measure of systemic risk.","[Liu, Xiaochun] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Liu, XC (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",xliu121@ua.edu,,"Liu, Xiaochun/0000-0001-7528-5491",,,,,40,18,18,2,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the WTP treatment, participants indicate the maximum amount of monthly benefits they are willing to give up to retire early. In the WTA treatment, the minimum increase of monthly payments to delay retirement is elicited. Our results reveal that the framing of the decision problem strongly influences participants' reservation price for early retirement. The WTA for early retirement is more than twice as high as the corresponding WTP. Using actual values from the German social security system as market prices, we demonstrate that the presentation in a WTA frame can induce early retirement. In this frame, the implicit probability of retiring early increases by 30 percentage points. We further show that the disparity between WTA and WTP is correlated with loss aversion.

Based on this background, there are concerns about how state firms can continue to stay relevant in the international oil industry by offsetting inefficiencies due to state control. This study assesses the effects of multinational operations on the performance of oil firms. This is achieved by comparing productive and scale efficiencies of state and private oil companies as well as state multinationals and private multinationals. A dataset of 50 firms each year from 2001 to 2010 reveals that although multinational operation is important in reducing productive inefficiencies of state firms, it does not mitigate scale inefficiencies of state-owned firms. State firms should therefore make multinational operations a key policy direction since this will provide a transformative agenda towards equally competing with their private counterparts. However, better efforts need to be paid in reducing scale inefficiencies that are pervasive among stateowned oil firms. Providing better controls on firm size will provide better drive towards future efficient production levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, local production disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The degree of financial contagion in commodity derivative market is found to be the largest with stock market and least with the gold market. A generalized VAR based volatility spillover estimation shows that commodity and stock markets are net transmitters of volatility while bond, foreign exchange and gold markets are the net receivers of volatility. Volatility is transmitted to commodity market only from the stock market. Such volatility spillover is found to have time varying nature, showing higher volatility spillover during the Global Financial Crisis and during the period of large rupee depreciation in 2013-14.

We base our analysis on data from the country's three largest banks that were made public when the Icelandic parliament lifted, among other things, bank secrecy laws in order to investigate the run-up to the financial crisis. We document how the banks were funded and where the money went, using a comprehensive analysis of their lending. The recovery from the crisis was based on policy decisions that, in hindsight, seem to have worked well. We analyze some of these policies-including emergency legislation, capital controls, alleviation of balance of payments risks, and preservation of financial stability. We also estimate the crisis's output costs, which were about average when compared with the 147 banking crises documented by Luc Laeven and Fabian Valencia (2012) and the 100 banking crises documented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2014). Our computation of the Icelandic government's direct costs reveals that its recently concluded negotiations with foreign creditors may even leave it with a net surplus as a consequence of the crisis. However, there is still uncertainty about the ultimate cost, and our benchmark estimate is that the cost was about 5 percent of GDP. We summarize several lessons from the episode.","[Benediktsdottir, Sigridur] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Eggertsson, Gauti Bergporuson] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Porarinsson, Eggert] Cent Bank Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",Yale University; Brown University,"Benediktsdóttir, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,74,7,7,0,7,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

J,"Coleman, W",,,,"Coleman, William",,,Weighing the Significance of World War I for the Australian Economy,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,The article argues there is little evidence that World War I quickened the currents of structural change in the Australian economy. It suggests instead that the War was reinforcing of the Deakinite model of economic management that already been established by the outbreak of War. It did so by enlarging the tenet of protection plus imperial preference' that had been inscribed in the pre-War policy consensus; by strengthening the revenue and power of the central state basic to the Deakinite framework of economic governance; and by assimilating rural interests into the terms of that framework.,"[Coleman, William] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Coleman, W (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",william.coleman@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

In this setting, uncertainty is over an unobservable, subjective state space. Preference over lottery-menu pairs is sufficient to identify the state space and the learning process. In this model, the agent is viewed as if he learns the utility of an object upon its consumption. This information is used to improve choice from the follow-on menu. This implies a trade-off between consumption value and information leading to experimentation. I provide a behavioral definition of experimentation. While the literature focuses on identifying subjective states through a demand for flexibility, I show that experimentation also (partially) identifies taste uncertainty.","[Cooke, Kevin] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Cooke, K (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kmcooke@bu.edu,,,,,,,13,2,3,0,3,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.
