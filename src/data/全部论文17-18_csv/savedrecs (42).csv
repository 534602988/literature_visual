The z-score threshold for bankruptcy is found to be higher in countries with stronger institutions. To test this claim, a cross-section data set of 86 Korean firms and 60 US firms from 1991 to 2001, extracted from a panel data set, is used. The empirical finding that the z-score bankruptcy threshold in the United States (which has better quality of institutions than does Korea) is higher than that in Korea is consistent with the prediction of the model. Additionally, having examined bankruptcy laws of the two countries, it is found that filing a petition for bankruptcy is easier and debtors rights are better protected in the United States than in Korea, which suggests that the bankruptcy laws of Korea and the United States may be partially responsible for the difference in the z-score threshold for bankruptcy.","[Kim, Jounghyeon] Chosun Univ, Dept Econ, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 61452, Jeonnam, South Korea",Chosun University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Chosun Univ, Dept Econ, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 61452, Jeonnam, South Korea.",jhyeon@chosun.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jounghyeon/0000-0002-4193-1237",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A8011347],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2015S1A5A8011347).,,36,8,8,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This paper gives an overview of some characteristic modern timber buildings in the Europe and the USA, as well as the different construction techniques being used. Successful initiatives supporting the use of timber for building construction are also presented. The opportunities for the further development of sustainable timber constructions lie in new production methods, high prefabrication, energy-efficient and climate-effective architecture and economic feasibility. Strong partnerships, increased responsibilities for planning, improved and systematic feedback of experience, team cooperation, and knowledge of user's preferences, are also important components of successful building project. There is a great market potential for the use of wood in all types of buildings, employing a combination of digital design as flexible planning and design tools in combination with CNC processing, to design and build extraordinary projects.","[Kuzman, Manja K.] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Haviarova, Eva] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Ljubljana; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Kuzman, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",manja.kuzman@bf.uni-ij.si,,,"Slovenian Research Agency [P4-0015]; Purdue University, the FNR's Wood Research Laboratory","Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Purdue University, the FNR's Wood Research Laboratory","This study was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency, Program P4-0015 and Purdue University, the FNR's Wood Research Laboratory.",,6,0,0,0,5,FAC FORESTRY BELGRADE UNIV,BELGRADE,"KNEZA VISESLAVA 1, BELGRADE, 11070, SERBIA",,,978-86-7299-277-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,200,206,,,,,,7,"Economics; Engineering, Manufacturing; Forestry",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Forestry,BM4XC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464293200024,0

We introduce an endogenous trade imbalance structure with trade cost into the model which helps to explore both tariff and non-tariff trade war effects. Our simulation results show that China will be significantly hurt by the China-US trade war, but negative impacts are affordable. The US can gain under unilateral sanction measures to China, but will lose if China takes retaliation measures. Comparing the effects under mutual trade war, China will lose more than the US. Introducing non-tariff barrier trade wars will intensify the negative effects, and comparatively negative effects to China are larger than to the US. Mexico's involvement in trade war with the US will strengthen the negative effects and comparatively hurt the US more. Under non-cooperative and cooperative Nash bargaining equilibrium, the US can gain more than China in trade war negotiation, which means the US has stronger bargaining power than China. Additionally, trade wars between China and the US will hurt most countries and the world especially in GDP and manufacturing employment, but benefit their welfare and trade.","[Li, Chunding; He, Chuantian; Lin, Chuangwei] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies GDUFS, Res Ctr Int Trade & Econ, 2 Baiyun Ave North, Guangzhou 510420, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunding] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Lin, CW (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies GDUFS, Res Ctr Int Trade & Econ, 2 Baiyun Ave North, Guangzhou 510420, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",linchuangweizl@126.com,,"He, Chuantian/0000-0001-6118-2707",Chinese National Social Science Foundation [15ZDC017],Chinese National Social Science Foundation,"We are grateful to the Chinese National Social Science Foundation's major project Constructing the Comprehensive Opening UP Pattern of Forming Land-Sea Type Internal and External Linkage, and East-West Type Two-Way Opening (15ZDC017) for financial support.",,16,103,115,26,469,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Also packaging from recycled material (re-HDPE) is less friendly to environment than boxes made from new polypropylene. The estimated environmental impact of polypropylene boxes was 4.42 Pt (eco-indicator point), for reHDPE and cardboard packaging it was 7.5 and 19.7% higher, respectively. The most important factor for the differences between the boxes was the durability of the packaging and the eventual need for multiple repeats of production phase, which include the acquisition of raw materials and processes related to the manufacturing of products.","[Majewski, Janusz; Sobolewska, Agnieszka] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Majewski, J; Sobolewska, A (通讯作者)，Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",janusz_majewski@sggw.pl; Agnieszka_Sobolewska@sggw.pl,"Majewski, Janusz/B-6133-2014; Sobolewska, Agnieszka/AFR-1531-2022","Majewski, Janusz/0000-0002-2221-462X; Sobolewska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-4903-6701",,,,,21,1,1,1,16,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,340,346,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.46,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600046,0

This article contributes to the literature on stock market reaction to policy announcements and the unintended consequences government policy can have in an emerging economy.","[Moses, Olayinka] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Accounting & Commercial Law, Victoria Business Sch, Wellington, New Zealand; [Moses, Olayinka; Maimako, Sebastian] Univ Jos, Jos, Nigeria; [Ehalaiye, Dimu] Massey Univ, Sch Accountancy, Massey Business Sch, Tennent Dr, Palmerston North 4474, New Zealand; [Fasua, Kayode] Nigerian Coll Accountancy, Kwall, Nigeria",Victoria University Wellington; University of Jos; Massey University,"Ehalaiye, D (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Accountancy, Massey Business Sch, Tennent Dr, Palmerston North 4474, New Zealand.",o.ehalaiye@massey.ac.nz,"Ehalaiye, Dimu/GQO-7861-2022; Moses, Olayinka/L-3282-2016","Ehalaiye, Dimu/0000-0002-0424-9108; Moses, Olayinka/0000-0003-3884-2222","School of Accountancy, Massey University, New Zealand; School of Accounting and Commercial Law, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand; University of Jos, Jos, Nigeria","School of Accountancy, Massey University, New Zealand; School of Accounting and Commercial Law, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand; University of Jos, Jos, Nigeria","We thank two anonymous referees and the 2016 conference participants at the African Accounting and Finance Association Conference, in Nairobi, Kenya for their helpful comments.

The characteristic for some regions of the Volga region is given according to their development in accordance with the ecological-economic index, the human development index and the index of the ecological footprint. In the sustainable development strategies of the key regions of the Volga region a comparison is made between environmental, social and economic development indicators. There is insufficient attention to environmental indicators. Competitive characteristics of the regions of the Volga region are reflected mainly through the prism of the human development index and also use insufficient data on the state of the environment and the use of natural resources. Integral socio-ecological and economic assessment of developed regions of the Volga region was made on three key indicators of sustainable development. The raw nature of the economic development of the Volga regions, characterized by a high dependence on the extraction of mineral resources, not only does not correspond to the idea of modernizing the economy, but also exacerbates the complex ecological situation.","[Nikonorov, Sergey Mikhailovich; Solovyova, Sofya Valentinovna] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Kirillov, Sergey Nikolaevich] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Nikonorov, SM (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Moscow, Russia.",nico.73@mail.ru; eco-msu@mail.ru; solovyevasv@gmail.com,"Kirillov, Sergey/D-7721-2013",,Russian Foundation for Basic Research [17-02-00773],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The study was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project No. 17-02-00773 Theoretical and methodological foundations for sustainable development of Russian regions (on the example of the Volga region).",,8,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-514-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,39.0,,,,,,360,363,,10.2991/cssdre-18.2018.75,0.0,,,4,Business; Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BO4YG,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000515721900075,0

Firstly, it is necessary to create an appropriate qualification structure of the population. That means sufficient number of experts and specialists in ICT, robotics, cybernetics etc., who will provide the required production and services but also research and development. Secondly, at the same time, it is essential to increase the computer literacy of the population and to create appropriate infrastructure.

To determinate a correlation between margin, GDP and the percentage of chain pharmacies (degree of liberalisation of pharmacy market). Methods: Systematic review of the margin regulations applicable to community pharmacies. Calculation the margin for the medicine at the ex-manufacturer price of CZK 150 ((sic)5.92). Visualization and comparison of information obtained in MS Excel. Regression analysis (general linear model) of processed data. Results: The Czech pharmaceutical distribution market is fully liberalised and horizontally and vertically integrated. 35% of the Czech community pharmacies are associated in chains. Pharmacy chains are active in 18 EU countries. In six EU countries, chains operate more than 50% of community pharmacies (Sweden, the Baltic States, the UK and Croatia). Norway currently has 86.6% of pharmacies associated with vertically integrated companies controlled by the three largest pharmacy chains (and wholesalers) in Europe. In nine other EU countries, at least one of these companies (Walgreens, Phoenix and McKesson) operates one of the three largest pharmacy chains. Walgreens, Phoenix and McKesson own over 7,000 pharmacies in the countries surveyed. Pharmacy chains are not legally permitted in eight EU countries, where 42% of all EU pharmacies operate. The average margin is 27.2% in the monitored countries. The minimum margin is 7% (Croatia), and the maximum is 59.8% (Germany). The mean of margins for countries with chains is 25.6% and for countries without chains is 29.7%. The statistical model indicates the positive correlation between margins and GDP. We did not find a clear association between the margin and the degree of liberalisation. Conclusion: A reduction in margins does not follow the deregulation of pharmacy market. The hypothesis that liberalisation brings lower costs to the healthcare payers was not confirmed.","[Pisek, Jaroslav; Picha, Kamil] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Písek, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",pisekj00@ef.jcu.cz; kpicha@ef.jcu.cz,"Pícha, Kamil/G-5227-2013",,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1440,1449,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400142,0

Modern-day Nigeria has emerged as Africa's largest economy, with 2014 GDP at over 568 billon USD (The World Bank, 2016). Thanks to the largest population in Africa and the strongest economy Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa. Although oil has been playing the mayor role in the structure of Nigeria's GDP the economic growth for over the last five years has been driven by growth in agriculture, telecommunications, and services. Economic growth and stability makes Nigeria according to PwC one of the potential power economies of the world (PwC 2016), but one the country is still facing several challenges economic, social and environmental. The biggest challenge is that according to the The World Factbook strong economic growth have not translated into a significant decline in poverty levels (Central Intelligence Agency, 2016). The government and President has announced plans to increase transparency, diversify the economy away from oil, improve fiscal management and working to develop stronger public-private partnerships for roads, agriculture, and power. That actions and activities are very positive, but because of significant differences between for example Europe, North America and Africa they should be designed specifically for Nigeria. The actions and activities should be strategically planed and follow latest developments of management and technological revolution like sustainability, knowledge sharing, Internet of things. The paper presents the challenges and possible scenario for Nigerian agriculture, one of the most dynamic and important sector for Nigerian economy, that produces not only economic output but could be nowadays fundament for welfare society supporting it with food, jobs and place to live.","[Senkus, Piotr] SledIce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Stanislawa Konarskiego 2, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland; [Major, Marzena; Eniola, Kehinde Justus] Joseph Ayo Babalola Univ, Akure Ilesha Rd, Ilara Mokin, Nigeria; [Kister, Agnieszka] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Pl MC Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Senkus, P (通讯作者)，SledIce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Stanislawa Konarskiego 2, PL-08110 Siedlce, Poland.",piotr.senkus@uph.edu.pl; kennyeniola@gmail.com; kennyeniola@gmail.com; agnieszka.kister@umcs.lublin.pl,"Eniola, Kehinde Imisi Temitope/IQS-4791-2023; Kister, Agnieszka/AAD-4863-2019; Eniola, Kehinde Imisi Temitope/IZQ-3288-2023","Eniola, Kehinde Imisi Temitope/0000-0002-3741-2047; Eniola, Kehinde Imisi Temitope/0000-0002-3741-2047",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1330,1344,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200113,0

It's argued that formation of the positive attitude to risks and selection of adequate methods for the negative effects minimization are required. The analysis of educational risks impact on students' human capital formation is the paper objective. For this purpose the students' attitude to educational risks as well as their readiness to cope with these risks were studied, and the risks minimization methods, used by students, were determined. The data of the mass survey of the Ural Federal District (UFD) students is the empirical basis of the paper (n=1 860, 2017). It's shown that three fourth of students is regularly faced with educational risks. It's obvious, that there is a close correlation between the students' attitude to educational risks and their readiness to cope with them. It was concluded, that Russian students know few about different mechanisms for educational risks minimization and rarely use them. However, it's possible to educate students for the use of different educational risks minimization mechanisms in case of nonlinear higher education model.","[Shabrova, Nina] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shabrova, N (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",n.v.shabrova@urfu.ru,"Shabrova, Nina/C-1970-2017","Shabrova, Nina/0000-0002-5694-1040",Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10046],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The article has been prepared with the support of the Russian Science Foundation, project no. 16-18-10046 Forming nonlinear model of the Russian higher education in the region in the context of economic and social uncertainty.",,12,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1546,1554,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400153,0

Second, some uncertainty indices perform well in forecasting economic activity indicators. It seems, however, that the best strategy is to apply forecast averaging techniques and to combine information provided by all uncertainty indices.","[Smiech, Slawomir] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Mucha, Aleksandra] Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Smiech, S (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",smiechs@uek.krakow.pl; aleksandra.mucha94@gmail.com,"Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018",,National Science Centre in Poland [2017/25/B/HS4/01058],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Centre in Poland (grant no 2017/25/B/HS4/01058).,,10,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,513,522,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.52,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700052,0

The local wheat crop is predominantly covered by native varieties, obtained by the Romanian researchers. The main use of wheat is represented by the production of bakery, and the quality of the final product is directly influenced by the physicochemical of the raw materials. Unlike most scientific studies that assess the yields according to soil quality, this paper identifies the suitable areas for wheat cultivation according to the quality of the product, the productivity per hectare and the average price of the production, using principal component analysis and clustering techniques.","[Teodor, Cristian; Bran, Mariana; Alecsandru, Vasile] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Teodor, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristian_teodor84@yahoo.ro; mariana.bran13@yahoo.com; vasile.strat@bbs.ase.ro,"Strat, Vasile/AAS-3578-2021","Strat, Vasile/0000-0002-5074-1419",,,,,23,1,1,2,8,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Their main argument is that participatory processes will bring policy actors together. Based on long- and short-term future-oriented thinking and actions, they will overcome their previous value-laden and interest based conflicts through informed communication, deliberation, policy learning and mutual cooperation. But do policy actors learn when they are thinking, debating and shaping the 'forest futures' they want to achieve or avoid? To what extent are current beliefs, values, worldviews, and conflict structures projected onto the future? What are their impacts on policy learning today? This paper addresses these research questions from a knowledge-based perspective of relevant policy learning theories. We trace changes and stability in beliefs, values (perception) and behavior (cooperation/conflict) among the involved policy actors. We assess to what extent future-oriented thinking and discussions contribute to, or inhibit, policy learning today. Empirically, the paper is informed by three case studies of regional 'forest futures' processes in Germany. They include forest landscapes in Upper Palatinate and South of Munich in Bavaria, and the Black Forest National Park in Baden-Wurttemberg. They represent different cases in terms of levels of stakeholder conflicts, integrative/segregative forest land use approaches, and the rural/urban divide. The paper is based on a qualitative analysis of interviews and documents about past and future forest land use, and observation of participatory scenario building and back -casting workshops during 2011-2014. In our analysis, we found that forest policy actors adhered to their pre-existing beliefs and remained divided in terms of present and future aspects of sustainable forest management. That is, we observed no substantial or only strategic policy learning among the involved policy actors. We explain these findings in terms of competing actors' belief systems and worldviews that lead to competing understandings and expectations of 'forest futures'. We discuss our research against the theoretical propositions and in view of the state-of-the art. We draw conclusions relevant for scholars and policymakers interested in collaborative policy learning processes, and suggest possible topics for further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the use of a mobility monitoring system accompanied with case conferences was investigated in order to improve sleep quality and estimate the cost benefit of this intervention. Method: In an open two-phase randomized controlled trial at three nursing homes, residents with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a control group. In the intervention group, a 10-week period of intensive use of the monitoring system and case conferences led by an advanced nurse practitioner (Phase I) was followed by 3 months of reduced use of the monitoring system and case conferences led by an internal registered nurse (Phase II). In the control group, the monitoring system was only used for data acquisition. Nurses reported the activities with a specifically developed tool. Based on the recorded activities, the cost of care was calculated. The correlating reimbursement per patient was calculated from the care levels in the Swiss reimbursement system. Data from 44 residents was included in the analysis with a linear mixed model. Results: Although analysis revealed no statistically significant effects, results indicate that the use of a monitoring system can guide nurses in organizing their tasks to increase effectiveness. Information systems such as the mobility monitor can help to identify single outliers that do not correspond with the overall situation. Conclusion: In the health care system, problematic individual cases can account for a disproportionally high cost levels. It was shown that information systems can have a significant economic impact in the long run.","[Stark, Mario; Tietz, Rigo] Univ Appl Sci St Gallen, Inst Business Management, Rosenbergstr 59, CH-9001 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Gattinger, Heidrun; Hantikainen, Virpi] Univ Appl Sci St Gallen, Inst Appl Nursing Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Ott, Stefan] Univ Appl Sci St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",,"Stark, M (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci St Gallen, Inst Business Management, Rosenbergstr 59, CH-9001 St Gallen, Switzerland.",mario.stark@fhsg.ch,"Gattinger, Heidrun/ISU-5697-2023","Gattinger, Heidrun/0000-0003-2399-8689","Swiss Federal Commission for Technology and Innovation [KTI-Nr. 16978.1 PFES-ES]; Compliant Concept, a private company","Swiss Federal Commission for Technology and Innovation; Compliant Concept, a private company","This study was funded by the Swiss Federal Commission for Technology and Innovation (grant number KTI-Nr. 16978.1 PFES-ES) and by Compliant Concept, a private company.

We address this research gap by quantifying the broader suite of ecosystem services that support small holder farmers and identifying farmers' knowledge of storm hazard reduction benefits provided by forest fragments in Madagascar. We survey 240 households and interview eight key informants to identify household and community responses in two communities with contrasting forest cover trajectories. Using multivariate statistics, results show a heavy dependence on forests for food and raw materials and a majority of the respondents holding a positive view of hazard mitigation services provided by forest fragments. Education levels, earning an income from forest based tourism and honey production are the only predictors of participation in forest management. Positive view of the hazard reduction benefits derived from forests could be due to external influences or personal observations, and together with barriers to participation in forest management need to be further investigated to better link forest management to reduced hazards risks. These findings are significant for forest management policy, as local knowledge and rationale for decisions are instrumental in the success of decentralized forest management and maintenance of vital forest benefits to farmers.

This approach allows for a differentiated treatment of various types of institutions. Moreover, the approach can also take account of the structures and processes at various levels of scale, as well as the role of agency in bringing about change. These points are illustrated and developed by an examination and comparison of institutional change in the governance arrangements in the city-regions of Saarland (Germany) and Teesside (UK) since the 1970s.","[Evenhuis, Emil] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of Cambridge,"Evenhuis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",ee293@cam.ac.uk,"Evenhuis, Emil/J-4659-2019","Evenhuis, Emil/0000-0001-8473-245X",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in the UK; Economic and Social Research Council [1114389] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in the UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I wish to thank Roman Martin and two anonymous referees, whose comments and suggestions have helped me to clarify and further develop the arguments presented in this article.

In this paper, we highlight the Agrarian Change Project, a multi-disciplinary research initiative, that applies detailed socio-ecological methodologies in multi-functional landscapes, and assess the subsequent implications for conservation, livelihoods and food security. Specifically, the research focuses on land use impacts in locations which exhibit various combinations of agricultural modification/change across a forest transition gradient in six tropical landscapes, in Zambia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. These methods include integrated assessments of the perceptions of ecosystem service provision, tree cover loss and gain, relative poverty, diets and agricultural patterns of change. Although numerous surveys on rural livelihoods are undertaken each year, often at great cost, many are hampered by weaknesses in methods and thus may not reflect rural realities. We attempt to highlight how integrating broader socio-ecological methods can be used to fill in those gaps and ensure such realities are indeed captured. Early findings suggest that the transition from a forested landscape to a more agrarian dominated system does not necessarily result in better livelihood outcomes and there may be unintended consequences of forest and tree cover removal. These include the loss of access to grazing land, loss of dietary diversity and the loss of ecosystem services/forest products.","[Sunderland, Terry; Abdoulaye, Rabdo; Foli, Samson; Gumbo, Davison; Kondwani, Mumba; Leonald, Laurio; Rowland, Dominic; Van Vianen, Josh] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Kota Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Sunderland, Terry] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Ahammad, Ronju; Stacey, Natasha] Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Asaha, Stella] Forests Resources & People, Limbe, Cameroon; [Baudron, Frederic; Duriaux, Jean-Yves] CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Eddy, Ian; Tomscha, Stephanie; Yang, Kevin; Gergel, Sarah] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Foli, Samson] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kshatriya, Mrigesh] UNEP MIKE Programme, Nairobi, Kenya; [Leonald, Laurio] Bogor Agr Univ, Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Rowland, Dominic] Sch Oriental & African Studies, London, England; [Deakin, Elizabeth] Opus Int Consultants, Wellington, New Zealand; [Khatun, Kaysara] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); James Cook University; Charles Darwin University; University of British Columbia; University of Amsterdam; Bogor Agricultural University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Sunderland, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Forestry Res, Kota Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.;Sunderland, T (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",t.sunderland@cgiar.org,"Eddy, Ian/ITT-7050-2023; Duriaux, Jean-Yves/AGX-9761-2022; Sunderland, Terence/AAS-5080-2021; /R-8570-2019; Sunderland, Terence/AAE-7851-2019; Stacey, Natasha E/N-2225-2013; Ahammad, Ronju/R-8910-2019","Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Rowland, Dominic/0000-0002-4631-8685; Yang, Kevin/0000-0001-7619-3978; Stacey, Natasha/0000-0002-2262-9817; Duriaux Chavarria, Jean-Yves/0000-0002-7880-4311; Van Vianen, Josh/0000-0003-0587-3364; Baudron, Frederic/0000-0002-5648-2083; Ahammad, Ronju/0000-0001-7978-0721",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); UK's Department for International Development (DFID) KnowFor,United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIARNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); UK's Department for International Development (DFID) KnowFor,"Funding for this project has been provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) KnowFor through grants to CIFOR.

A retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study compared treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs among children/adolescents with ADHD aged 6-17 years at treatment initiation (index) in Germany who received atomoxetine (ATX) or long-acting methylphenidate (LA-MPH) monotherapy. Patients received at least one prescription for their index medication (ATX/LA-MPH) during 2006-2010; the first prescription marked the index date. ATX- and LA-MPH-indexed cohorts were matched 1:1 (n = 737); a patient subset was identified that had not received ADHD-indicated medications in 12 months prior to index (novel initiators: ATX, n = 486; LA-MPH, n = 488). Treatment patterns were evaluated among novel initiators, and HRU and costs among the matched cohorts in the 12 months after index. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between the novel initiator patient subsets. ATX-indexed novel initiators had significantly longer persistence to index medication [mean (standard deviation; SD) days: 222.0 (133.9) vs 203.2 (135.0), P = 0.029) but higher switching rates (8.8 vs 5.5 %, P = 0.045) than LA-MPH-indexed novel initiators. The total ATX-indexed cohort required more prescriptions [any medication; mean (SD): 20.9 (11.5) vs 15.7 (9.0), P < 0.001] and outpatient visits [mean (SD): 10.1 (6.3) vs 8.3 (5.3), P < 0.001], and incurred significantly higher total median healthcare costs (a,notsign1144 vs a,notsign541, P < 0.001) versus matched LA-MPH patients. These real-world data indicate that, among children/adolescents with ADHD in Germany, ATX-indexed patients may require more prescriptions and physician visits, and incur higher total healthcare costs, than matched LA-MPH patients.","[Greven, Peter] Inst Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychotherapy &, Berlin, Germany; [Greven, Peter] H G Univ Hlth & Sport Technol & Arts, Berlin, Germany; [Sikirica, Vanja; Curtice, Tammy G.] Shire, Wayne, PA USA; [Chen, Yaozhu J.; Makin, Charles] IMS Hlth Inc, Fairfax, VA USA",Shire Pharmaceuticals Limited,"Chen, YZJ (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth Inc, Fairfax, VA USA.",chenyaozhu@hotmail.com,,,"Shire Development, LLC","Shire Development, LLC","The research was performed and analysed by IMS Health, Inc (Fairfax, VA), funded by Shire Development, LLC.

We offer the first evaluation of these policies that accommodates geographic variability in the magnitude of this policy's treatment effect. Focusing on the outcome of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) adoption in California, we employ a generalized propensity score approach that allows for continuous, rather than binary, treatment effects. We estimate a state-wide dose-response curve to show that access to 6, 20, and 100 miles of nearby HOV lanes leads to 1, 3, and 10 additional PEV registrations in a census tract. The lower end of our 95% confidence interval implies that at least one quarter of California PEV registrations during 2010-2013 were a result of the HOV lane policy.

This article reviews the extent of this type of work in Australia, and its main characteristics. It then considers the applicability of existing employment regulations to these gig' jobs, citing both Australian and international legislation and case law. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope of traditional regulations, minimum standards and remedies in the realm of irregular digitally mediated work. Regulators and policymakers should consider how to strengthen and expand the regulatory framework governing gig work. The article notes five major options in this regard: enforcement of existing laws; clarifying or expanding definitions of employment'; creating a new category of independent worker'; creating rights for workers', not employees; and reconsidering the concept of an employer'. We review the pros and cons of these approaches and urge regulators to be creative and ambitious in better protecting the minimum standards and conditions of workers in these situations.","[Stewart, Andrew] Univ Adelaide, Law, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Stanford, Jim] Australia Inst, Ctr Future Work, Manuka, ACT, Australia; [Stanford, Jim] McMaster Univ, Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of Adelaide; McMaster University,"Stewart, A (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Law Sch, Ligertwood Bldg,North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",andrew.stewart@adelaide.edu.au,,"Stewart, Andrew/0000-0002-9758-3753",,,,,46,223,251,9,255,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The contribution of this paper is to study different hypotheses linking self-perceived health status and income, allowing for the identification of different mechanisms in income-related health inequalities. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (15 countries), we take the advantage of the cross-sectional and longitudinal nature of this rich database to make robust results. The analyses (coefficient estimates as well as average marginal effects) strongly support two hypotheses by showing that (i) income has a positive and concave effect on health (Absolute Income Hypothesis); (ii) income inequalities in a country affect all members in a society (strong version of the Income Inequality Hypothesis). However, our study suggests that, when considering the position of the individual in the income distribution, as well as the interaction between income inequalities and these rankings, one cannot identify individuals the most affected by income inequalities (which should be the least well-off in a society according to the weak version of the Income Inequality Hypothesis). Finally, the robustness of this study is emphasized when implementing a generalized ordered probit to consider the subjective nature of the self-perceived health status to avoid the traps encountered in previous studies.","[Adeline, Amelie; Delattre, Eric] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Bd Port, F-95000 Cergy, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Universite de Bourgogne,"Adeline, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Bd Port, F-95000 Cergy, France.",amelie.adeline@u-cergy.fr,,"Adeline, Amelie/0000-0002-5327-8570","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001- 00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006- 028812, SHARE-PREP: N 211909, SHARE-LEAP: N 227822, SHARE M4: N 261982]; German Ministry of Education and Research; U.S. National Institute on Ageing [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, R21 AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG BSR06-11, OGHA 04-064]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); U.S. National Institute on Ageing(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This paper uses data from SHARE Waves 1, 2, 4 and 5 (DOIs: 10.6103/SHARE.w1.260, 10.6103/SHARE.w2.260, 10.6103/SHARE.w4.111, 10.6103/SHARE.w5.100).

This paper examines how this energy boom has affected regional crime rates throughout the country. We find positive effects on rates of various property and violent crimes in shale-rich counties. In 2013, the cost of the additional crimes in the average treatment county was roughly $2 million. These results are not easily explained by shifts in observed demographics like gender and age. There is however evidence that people with criminal records (registered sex offenders) moved disproportionally to shale boom towns in North Dakota. We also document a rise in income inequality (a postulated determinant of criminal activity) that coincides with the timing of the energy boom. Policy makers in boom towns should anticipate these crime effects and invest in public infrastructure accordingly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The article shows that development' has always presented a much wider challenge to the vision of the trade regime championed by the major trading nations. The development discourse has conceived the trade regime's historical significance, the regime's aims, and the relationships among its members in ways that were often fundamentally at odds with the conception preferred by most developed countries. The article explores how the development discourse has informed lawmaking initiatives by developing countries throughout the history of the trade regime. While not all of these initiatives were successful or necessarily fruitful, they show that the pursuit of development in trade lawmaking has always been more than an effort to seek exemption from trade rules.","[Lamp, Nicolas] Queens Univ, Fac Law, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Lamp, N (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Fac Law, Kingston, ON, Canada.",Nicolas.Lamp@queensu.ca,,,,,,,75,7,7,1,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2017,16.0,3,,,,,475,500,,10.1017/S1474745616000616,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EY2GJ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403786300003,0

Payment scales are often used in CV studies as the questionnaire format of choice. The study summarized here analyzes the impact of the design of two payment scales (PS) on the monetary value of QALY gains. The scales differed in terms of their end-points, mid points, and coarseness. We judged the performance of the two PS against several indicators: the average WTP per QALY estimates, post-estimation uncertainty levels, the existence of mid-point concentration, and the dependency on end-points. Our results show that PS design influences respondents' WTP values. The results also suggest that a more detailed scale with a more realistic range may help respondents to elicit values closer to their true WTP values, hence produce higher-quality outcomes. Further research and pretesting strategies are suggested to explore and minimize the effects of PS design on WTP estimates, which may ultimately increase the quality of WTP estimates.","[Soeteman, Lotte; van Exel, Job; Bobinac, Ana] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, IBMG, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Exel, Job] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bobinac, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, IBMG, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bobinac@bmg.eur.nl,"Bobinac, Ana/ABE-8124-2021; van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013; Bobinac, Ana/AAF-6113-2021","Bobinac, Ana/0000-0001-8798-9795; van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777;",research program VENI [451-13-006]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); ZonMW [152002038],research program VENI; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ZonMW(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development),"This work is part of the research program VENI (Grant Number 451-13-006), which is financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), and ZonMW funding (Grant Number 152002038).

Individuals gain eligibility to substantial tax credits and cost-sharing reductions at 100 percent (138 percent in Medicaid expansion states) of the federal poverty level (FPL), lose eligibility for cost-sharing reductions at 250 percent FPL, and lose eligibility for the tax credits at 400 percent FPL. Using the Current Population Survey and a regression discontinuity design, this study exploits the exogenous differences in subsidy eligibility in 2014 at three cutoffs to identify the separate and combined effects of the tax credits and cost-sharing reductions on private insurance coverage. I estimate a 5.4 percentage point increase in private insurance coverage just above 138 percent FPL in Medicaid expansion states and a smaller effect above 100 percent FPL in non-expansion states attributable to the combined incentives. I calculate a price elasticity of demand for health insurance of -0.65, suggesting low-income individuals may be highly price responsive. Coverage increases do not appear to be driven by adverse selection, and there is no evidence of crowding out or income manipulation around the cutoffs. Tax credit and cost-sharing reduction levels would need to be raised at higher incomes to induce more participation.","[Hinde, Jesse M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, RTI Int, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Research Triangle Institute,"Hinde, JM (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, RTI Int, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",hindjm@gmail.com,"Hinde, Jesse M./AAA-6814-2019","Hinde, Jesse/0000-0002-0552-401X",University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; RTI International; RTI International Fellows Program,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; RTI International; RTI International Fellows Program,"This research was supported under a Dissertation Completion Fellowship from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a Professional Development Award from RTI International, and the RTI International Fellows Program.",,33,18,21,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

This study presents an innovative valuation approach integrating techniques of operations research and economic theory of pricing environmental goods. A forest planning problem was inversed through altering its reward function of timber values so that the observed harvesting behavior became optimal. The discrepancy between the original and new rewards uncovered amenities values which were linked to forest attributes via hedonic models. This method was applied to a case study of the U.S. southern pine region. Depending on forest conditions, total economic values of amenities varied from zero to just under one thousand dollar per ha. At a discount rate of 3%, a typically managed forest generated on average $243 ha(-1) of amenities values per annum, more than twice of harvested timber values. Structural diversity and density of large pine trees were the key determinants to preserving forests for environmental amenities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of developing countries FT is mostly based on case studies and exploring a limited set of drivers that result in forest cover change. This paper attempts to identify and explain trends in forest cover Change across nine countries of the Asia Pacific based on panel data of a period of over 50 years (1962-2011). We used discriminant analysis to identify relationships between bio-physical variables (forest cover area and land under cultivation) and socioeconomic variables (GDP, assets and infrastructure), and the transition status (transition vs. no transition) of the countries. The results show a net increase in forest cover in China, India (with consistent increase in the area of agricultural land in both), Philippines and Vietnam; and a decrease in Indonesia, Laos, and Malaysia (with a consistent decrease in the area of agricultural land). They also show a decrease of forest cover and area of agricultural land in both Japan and South Korea. The discriminant analysis results suggest that FT is linked to variation in area of agricultural land (Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam), livestock population (China, Indonesia, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia), urban population (India, Laos, Philippines, Vietnam), cereal production (Indonesia, Japan, Philippines), and area of arable land (China and Japan). The results concur with FT predictions of forest cover change in relation to bio-physical and Socioeconomic dynamics, with heterogeneity in rates of change across the nine countries. The results have implications for existing FT models. We conclude that there is opportunity for a refinement of analyses and explanations of FT by considering the effect of precise bio-physical and socioeconomic drivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Unemployment dynamics and self-employment probabilities are studied using a dynamic multinomial logit model with unobserved heterogeneity.

We chose the milk market as a case study, in line with the recent call from the EU Commission for governance tools which help to better address such highly volatile markets. Furthermore, on the first of April 2015, the new Common Agricultural Policy ended quotas for milk, which led to a milk crisis in the EU. Thus, we collaborated with milk experts to get their inputs for a new model to analyse the competitive environment. Consequently, we constructed graphs to represent the major factors that affect the milk industry and the relationships between them. We obtained several network measures for this social network, such as centrality and density. Some factors appear to have the largest major influence on all the other graph elements, while others strongly interact in cliques. Any detected changes in any of these factors will automatically impact the others. Therefore, scanning ones competitive environment can allow an organisation to get an early warning to help it avoid an issue (as much as possible) and/or seize an opportunity before its competitors. We conclude that Strategic Early Warning Systems as a corporate foresight approach utilising graph theory can strengthen the governance of markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using longitudinal data from a nationally representative survey and rich administrative records from North Carolina, we investigate the relationship between student absences and academic performance. Generally, student absences are associated with modest but statistically significant decreases in academic achievement. The harmful effects of absences are approximately linear, and are two to three times larger among fourth and fifth graders in North Carolina than among kindergarten and first-grade students in the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. In both datasets, absences similarly reduce achievement in urban, rural, and suburban schools. In North Carolina, the harm associated with student absences is greater among both low-income students and English language learners, particularly for reading achievement. Also, in North Carolina, unexcused absences are twice as harmful as excused absences. Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed.","[Gershenson, Seth; Jacknowitz, Alison] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Brannegan, Andrew] Aspire Publ Sch, Oakland, CA 94606 USA",American University,"Gershenson, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",gershens@american.edu; jacknowi@american.edu; andrew.brannegan@aspirepublicschools.org,,"Gershenson, Seth/0000-0001-8780-0569",Spencer Foundation; American Educational Research Association (AERA); AERA Grants Program from National Science Foundation under NSF [DRL-0941014],Spencer Foundation; American Educational Research Association (AERA); AERA Grants Program from National Science Foundation under NSF,"This research was supported in part by grants from the Spencer Foundation and the American Educational Research Association (AERA).

These factors conspire in unusual ways to delay and hinder those important developments that represent the critical transformation to effect meaningful change. These have become known as 'wicked, messy' problems and must be attended to with alternate planning approaches. This paper presents the use of General Morphological Analysis as a method to identify, investigate and successfully manage those systemic factors within a broader effort aimed at resetting the conditions. The research centred on Australian government support to a major nation in the South Pacific and its efforts to establish and maintain security and law enforcement capabilities alongside other nation building endeavours. The organisational design analysis exposed the principal factors that were central to achievements and detailed their associated conditions; it allowed precise specification of the current conditions; it contrasted these with the desired conditions; and it enabled planners to map a series of achievable changes to get from 'here' to 'there'. Several 'tipping' points were also revealed that encouraged planners to sequence their efforts and set the pre-conditions for more ambitious undertakings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Kaivo-oja, J",,,,"Kaivo-oja, Jari",,,Towards better participatory processes in technology foresight: How to link participatory foresight research to the methodological machinery of qualitative research and phenomenology?,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Participative foresight; FTA tools and methods; Qualitative research; Phenomenology; Methodology; Science; Methodological development; Triangulation,INTEGRAL FUTURES; SCIENCE; DIVIDE,"Technological progress does not happen in a social vacuum. Shaping of tomorrow is not possible without qualitative analyses. Therefore, the social and psychological dimensions of reality form an important part of technology foresight. Qualitative research will be needed to understand superficial and deep structures of social realities. So called push and pull factors are always linked to social behaviour. People's relationship to the use of technologies and the utilization of technologies is a complex and not a one-dimensional or monological issue. Monological methodological approaches can be harmful and confusing in the field of participatory foresight. We can conclude that the cycles of deductive and inductive logic are needed in science and in participatory foresight studies. Experts of the FTA community must have a higher level of methodological know-how in this research field and they should use qualitative methods in multi -faceted (external and internal) ways in foresight studies. Still the qualitative parts of many studies are quite monological and these studies can be quite problematic, even confusing. More critical methodological approaches should be taken into serious consideration. As a methodological approach, the principle of triangulation should be used more in the fields of participatory foresight studies and technology foresight. The key focus of this article in the use of qualitative and phenomenological approaches in the fields of FTA and foresight. The aim of this theoretically oriented discussion is to promote the professional use of qualitative methods in foresight and ETA studies. The strength of qualitative analyses is linked to deeper understanding of social change and social patterns and structures. Actually people create and constitute the markets, networks, and crowds where technologies are applied and used. Internal systemic understanding of social realities is an important part of foresight activities, especially in participatory foresight studies. Internal and external analyses can be seen as complementary approaches, like qualitative and quantitative approaches. The use of qualitative methods is a conventional part of the research process in participatory foresight projects. A typical problem may be that the use of methods is not planned carefully enough and people are unaware of the underlying key assumptions of applied methods. Experimenting with phenomenology is not a simple task in foresight research. Therefore, the views and informative platforms expressed and presented in this article may be useful for foresight practitioners.

This phenomenon has been subject to research since the last two decades under the title of home bias. The preference for investing close to home also applies to portfolios of domestic stocks. In other words, asymmetric information between local and nonlocal investors may drive the preference for geographically proximate investments and this phenomenon is called local bias in the terminology of behavioral finance. This study provides new evidence concerning local bias of individual investors in an emerging country's stock market namely, Borsa Istanbul (BIST). More specifically, this study investigates whether individual investors weigh shares of firms, which are geographically close to themselves, more than expected in their portfolios. The results of the analyses indicate that Turkish individual investors are prone to local bias on the average. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the reason for their tendency to invest in local stocks is not informational advantage.","[Arik, Evren; Suer, Omur] Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Arik, Evren] Borsa Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey",Galatasaray University; Borsa Istanbul,"Arik, E (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.;Arik, E (通讯作者)，Borsa Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey.",evren.arik@yahoo.com.tr; osuer@gsu.edu.tr,"SUER, OMUR/AAB-2982-2020","SUER, OMUR/0000-0001-9997-6457",galatasaray university research fund [15.102.003],galatasaray university research fund(Galatasaray University),This research has been financially supported by galatasaray university research fund (15.102.003).,,30,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,244,252,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700025,0

Divergence between the 'visible' and the 'hidden' side of organization invites a critical work of 'unveiling'.

During moments of 'crisis' or 'breach', contradictions are both acknowledged and given concrescence. Management comes into being in the anticipation of its breaking. Four accounts of this process are offered - a discussion of a remark from Michel Serres's The Parasite, a description of China Mielville's novel The City and The City, stories from fieldwork in medium-secure forensic psychiatric units, and set of conceptual propositions. Together they perform a descriptive practice called 'dark organization theory' which analyses the functional aspects of divergence and breaking in management and organizational practices.","[Brown, Steven D.] Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Dept Social & Org Psychol, Leicester, Leics, England; [Reavey, Paula] London South Bank Univ, Dept Psychol, London, England",University of Leicester; London South Bank University,"Brown, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Dept Social & Org Psychol, Leicester, Leics, England.",s.d.brown@le.ac.uk,,"Reavey, Paula/0000-0002-0903-9097; Brown, Steven/0000-0001-7841-3225",,,,,24,3,4,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

This paper proposes to create a Global Fund for Women through Innovative Finance (GFWIF) with the ability to raise funds through innovative sources of finance on a scale more appropriate to the estimated requirements of making reasonable progress toward gender equality (US$31-107 billion per year in constant 2014 dollars). It builds on previous calls by feminist economists for the establishment of such funds through global forms of taxation. Since donors' commitments only meet the lower bound, the GFWIF could scale up funding for gender equality interventions commensurate with country needs. Global resource mobilization through innovative mechanisms, including allocations of new Special Drawing Rights, currency transaction taxes, and carbon taxes, have the potential to provide the necessary financing at a much faster pace than is currently possible.","[Erten, Bilge] Northeastern Univ, Econ, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cagatay, Nilufer] Univ Utah, Econ, 366 OSH, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Northeastern University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Erten, B (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Econ, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",b.erten@neu.edu; nil.cagatay@gmail.com,"Erten, Bilge/S-4871-2019","Erten, Bilge/0000-0002-3142-8072",,,,,54,3,3,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This piece of cartographic work in banking regulation had two aims: (a) to represent the economic reality, including the parts that were not in regulatory sight, with full realism and (b) to develop a regulatory surveillance regime to monitor shadow banking to prevent future crises. This paper problematises the first aim as a peculiar cognitive response to the knowledge crisis of economics which challenges the consensus on modern finance as post-modern Baudrilliardian simulacra. The paper then introduces a cultural economy perspective to explore the regulatory fear in the second aim of the shadow banking analysis with references to the theme of the Doppelganger (the Double) in the genre of horror stories. Finally the societal consequences of the control oriented epistemological choices of the shadow banking analysis are problematised by using Michel Serres concepts of foedera natura versus foedera fati.","[Erturk, Ismail] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, People Management & Org Div, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Erturk, I (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, People Management & Org Div, Manchester, Lancs, England.",ismail.erturk@manchester.ac.uk,"Erturk, Ismail/W-4693-2019","Erturk, Ismail/0000-0003-3204-4430",,,,,73,10,10,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Through the research, we find left-behind children feel satisfied for most services. However, they are less satisfied with services that require higher professional qualifications, which results from the lack of talents, technical support and working capital, such as psychological counseling. And left-behind children think these services are of high importance. So these services are the key improvements of social organizations.

This interrelated e-publication of financial statements fits in the Europe 2020 strategy as well as in the EU and national legal frameworks. However, does it truly operate vis-a-vis financial statements? A general exploration of the national business registers section of the European e-Justice portal, as well as Czech national case studies reflecting the post-recodification Czech Commercial Register framework and operation, reveals that the reality is far from perfection. Perhaps the EU is reaching the digital single internal market, but still a reliable, free and electronic availability of financial statements of all subjects from the EU is more a myth than reality. This demonstrates the persistent discrepancies in both the approaches and commitment to free e-publication of financial statements in EU member states and suggests that Europe 2020 visions in this arena can become rather chimeras.","[MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka] Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University,"MacGregor Pelikanova, R (通讯作者)，Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic.",radkamacgregor@yahoo.com; robertkmacgregor@yahoo.com,"MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018","MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146",,,,,27,7,7,0,0,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,98,111,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100007,0

In this paper, our focus was to develop an ANN application in order to analyze the financial performance of the SMEs in Romania. For historical reasons, this sector seems to be still weakly developed in that country, both quantitative (being situated on one of the last places in the En entrepreneurial intensity) and qualitative, having a weak economic performance with a modest contribution to GDP. Literature shows the importance of this sector for the economies of different countries, and diverse scientific methods used for its description and analysis. One of our research purposes was the identification of those factors that condition the profitability of companies, thus providing useful directions and possible strategies for developing the SME sector. The selected information source was represented by the annual balance sheets, from about 8000 of medium-sized companies in Romania. As a means of verifying the obtained results, econometric methods were used, such as regression analysis, which could identify and validate the models that emphasize the dynamics with different influence factors. The conclusions obtained could prove their utility in both the investigation of the combining quantitative methods (ANN and regression), and in the SME sector management plan.","[Nastac, Dumitru-Iulian] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania; [Isaic-Maniu, Alexandru] Romanian Acad, Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Dragan, Irina-Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nastac, DI (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania.",nastac@ieee.org; alex.maniu@gmail.com; irina.dragan@csie.ase.ro,"ISAIC-MANIU, Alexandru N./K-4345-2017; Nastac, Dumitru-Iulian/B-8376-2017; Nastac, Dumitru-Iulian/J-2621-2019; Dragan, Irina Maria/M-1083-2017; Dragan, Irina Maria/AAA-6838-2021; Dragan, Irina Maria/B-9540-2009","ISAIC-MANIU, Alexandru N./0000-0001-6868-2907; Nastac, Dumitru-Iulian/0000-0003-1939-5682; Dragan, Irina Maria/0000-0001-9349-1846; Dragan, Irina Maria/0000-0001-9349-1846",,,,,23,1,1,0,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We find that the media platform with high quality does not necessarily charge a higher subscription fee or advertising fee than the media platform with low quality in the presence of cross externalities between consumers and advertisers. In the consumer market, if the cross externality is sufficiently strong relative to the vertical differentiation in the consumer market and the horizontal differentiation on the advertising market, then the high-quality media firm charges a lower subscription fee than the low-quality media firm. In the advertising market, it is also possible for the high-quality firm to charge a lower subscription fee if the externality of consumers is weaker than the externality of advertisers.","[Pan, Lijun] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Pan, LJ (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",pan.lijun.nu@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,3,4,2,38,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The literature and politics of sex work migration and human trafficking economies are commonly relegated to the realm that focuses on profits for criminal networks and pimps, in particular recirculating the claim that human trafficking is the third largest criminal economy after drugs and weapons. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among Nigerian sex worker migrants conducted in Benin City, Nigeria, in 2011 and 2012, this study brings together four otherwise isolated migration economies - facilitation, remittances, deportation, and rescue - and suggests that we have to examine multiple sites and relink these in order to more fully understand the complexity of sex work migration. Drawing upon literature within transnational feminist analysis, critical human trafficking studies, and migration industry research, this study seeks to broaden our current understanding of the economy of human trafficking.","[Plambech, Sine] Danish Inst Int Studies, Oestbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen OE, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Plambech, S (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Int Studies, Oestbanegade 117, DK-2100 Copenhagen OE, Denmark.",sinebech@gmail.com,,,,,,,69,33,36,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The emphasis is on contributing to the development of the individual and society as a whole. In that context, accounting and financial reporting of non-profit organizations have an important role as a source of quality information. Management of non-profit organization is requiring information for the process of decision making while public authorities are demanding transparency of reporting. Accounting, as a basic source of information about non-profit organization, can be organized differently depending on a number of factors, with two approaches being predominantly: employment of the qualified persons for accounting operations in their own organization or through outsourcing of accounting. Every approach has its advantages and disadvantage. Therefore, this paper explores the way in which the accounting is organized in non-profit organizations in Croatia. The empirical research was conducted in the year 2017 on a sample of associations in the Croatia. The paper examines the correlation between the way in which accounting is performed and the size of non-profit organization measured by the amount of revenues. Moreover, paper presents results regarding user's satisfaction with the quality of accounting information due to different organization of accounting function. Summarized conclusion of the paper is that associations, as a dominant form of non-profit organizations in Croatia, are oriented on outsourcing of accounting function and that the level of user's satisfaction with the quality of accounting information is on very high level.","[Vasicek, Vesna; Kostic, Martina Dragija; Zmuk, Berislav] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Vasicek, V (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",vvasicek@efzg.hr; mdragija@efzg.hr; bzmuk@efzg.hr,"Zmuk, Berislav/H-8454-2018; VASICEK, VESNA/H-9685-2018","Zmuk, Berislav/0000-0003-3487-1376; VASICEK, VESNA/0000-0002-5060-1678",,,,,8,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,430,438,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700046,0

This study further compared the use of trade credit between the firms of different scale. The results suggest that trade credit is an important source of funding for companies in the Chinese economy. Firstly, trade credit terms vary across industries, but tend to stay stable within industries and over time. Secondly, some manufacturing industries are net trade credit providers while others are net trade credit recipients.

I begin with a brief biography and a summary of his main works in economics. I then explore in some detail ideas related to the economic surplus, unpaid labour and exploitation, and attempt to tease out the implications of his analysis for the determination of the wage share. While I argue that Marx has not succeeded in providing adequate theoretical support for his prediction that the wage share will fall as capital accumulates, he has nonetheless provided a very interesting and insightful collection of ideas by which we may, even today, approach a wide range of issues relating to production and distribution.","[Dixon, Robert] Univ Melbourne, Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Dixon, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.dixon@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Teamwork and class discussions-modern practices-are strongly related to better achievement, while rote learning and individual work-traditional practices-to lower achievement. But that association is only significant when using students' reports. Teaching styles are differently related to achievement along several dimensions-math and reading, boys and girls, public/private students-but again basically when we rely on students' reports. The analysis of the differences in the perspectives does not show conclusive evidence about the student and teacher characteristics that explain those differences.

We analyze how incentive design affects quality improvements in the nursing home setting, where several state Medicaid agencies have implemented P4P programs that vary in incentive structure. Using the Minimum Data Set and the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting data from 2001 to 2009, we examine how the weights put on various performance measures that are tied to P4P bonuses, such as clinical outcomes, inspection deficiencies, and staffing levels, affect improvements in those measures. We find larger weights on clinical outcomes often lead to larger improvements, but small weights can lead to no improvement or worsening of some clinical outcomes. We find a qualifier for P4P eligibility based on having few or no severe inspection deficiencies is more effective at decreasing inspection deficiencies than using weights, suggesting simple rules for participation may incent larger improvement.","[Konetzka, R.

More specifically, as Policy Analysis has a strong link with policymaking, this paper explores the possibility of linking Policy Analysis to the futures field through the use of an uncertainty typology applied in Policy Analysis. The typology can be used to structure the various forward-looking disciplines (or subfields) of the futures field according to the level of uncertainty that they address.

Using farmer survey data in Maryland, we estimate a two-stage simultaneous equation model to correct for voluntary enrollment. Econometric model results are integrated with the Chesapeake Bay Program watershed model to estimate nitrogen abatement for the Bay and associated abatement costs. Estimated additionality for nitrogen abatement is 97% for enrolled farmers when only the direct treatment effect on cover crops is taken into account, but reductions in vegetative cover (slippage) and indirect effects on conservation tillage are consequential. Slippage is particularly large among farmers not currently enrolled in the program, indicating that loss of vegetative cover may substantially offset pollution abatement if cost sharing is extended to this group. These findings suggest that unenrolled farmers may not be a low-cost source of pollution abatement as is often assumed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper provides new empirical evidence of pollution avoidance that Chinese urban residents purchase particulate-filtering facemasks to protect against ambient air pollution. The analysis is conducted with detailed and comprehensive data available on daily facemask purchases and air quality that became available only very recently. We find that this transitory air pollution avoidance behavior exhibits dynamics and nonlinearities, with significant increases of facemask purchases during extreme pollution episodes. The daily model shows that a 100-point increase in Air Quality Index (AQI) increases the consumption of all masks by 54.5 percent and anti-PM2.5 masks by 70.6 percent. The estimates from the aggregated model with flexible pollution levels are used to simulate the benefit of air quality improvement. If 10 percent of heavy pollution days (AQI >= 201) were eliminated, the total savings on facemasks alone would be approximately 187 million USD in China. This result suggests that reducing the occurrence of airpocalypse events represents a significant opportunity to improve social welfare. Nevertheless, our estimates are likely only a small part of the benefit of clean air because facemasks can only partially reduce the negative health effects of air pollution and the costs of other avoidance behaviors are not included.

We use 250 estimates from 30 studies conducted between 2005 and 2017. Our meta-regressions include estimates on a wide variety of children's outcomes, ranging from (non-)cognitive development measured during early childhood to educational outcomes and earnings in adulthood. Overall, the evidence on universal ECEC is mixed. Age of enrollment is not a major factor in explaining the impact. Some evidence indicates that more intensive programs produce more favorable outcomes. Program quality matters critically: high quality arrangements consistently generate positive child outcomes. Publicly provided programs produce more favorable effects than privately provided (and mixed) programs. There is no evidence of fading out. Furthermore, the gains of ECEC are concentrated within children from lower socioeconomic families.","[van Huizen, Thomas; Plantenga, Janneke] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Postbus 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"van Huizen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Sch Econ, Postbus 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",t.m.vanhuizen@uu.nl,,,,,,,94,83,96,2,46,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Using data on plant-level toxic emissions from 1996 to 2009 from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory, and newly collected data on the location and content of newspapers, I find that the probability that a plant's emissions are featured in a nearby newspaper increases with the plant's proximity to the newspaper's headquarter. Further, plants located near a larger number of newspapers' headquarters produce lower toxic emissions. The latter result is specific to plants operating in those industries that produce consumer goods, suggesting an important role of accountability through consumer demand. An event-study analysis also shows that when newspapers cover the emissions of consumer goods producers, these reduce their emissions by 29% with respect to those plants that were not covered, whereas there is no evidence of differential trends in the years that lead up to coverage.

Urban functions were classified into basic, developmental, sustainable, and maintenance functions, and were measured using 25 indicators. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to integrate each function into a single value. Cluster analysis was applied to 232 cities in Korea and analyzed for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. The analysis revealed that clusters appeared between variables centered on metropolitan cities and variables of climate variability. In 2000 and 2005, Korean cities had similar clusters, but in 2010, they manifested a different pattern. This study suggests that the construction and accumulation of time-series data is necessary for understanding the lack of each function of the city in constructing adaptation policies for communities.","[Kim, Donghyun; Song, Seul-Ki] Korea Environm Inst, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Kim, D (通讯作者)，Korea Environm Inst, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea.",donghyunkim@kei.re.kr; sksong@kei.re.kr,"Kim, Donghyun/HDO-8306-2022","Kim, Donghyun/0000-0003-3711-5103",Korea Environment Institute [2016-02]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korean Government [NRF-2017R1A2B4008057],Korea Environment Institute; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This study was supported by the research project of the Korea Environment Institute [Grant number 2016-02] and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (No, NRF-2017R1A2B4008057).",,49,11,11,6,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,89,103,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.05.001,0.0,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900009,0

The model we develop uses variables common in forestry practice and yields the threshold value of seedling failure at which both alternatives offer the same economic result based on a comparative analysis of costs and benefits. By comparing this threshold with the level of seedling failure expected for an afforestation in the absence of irrigation, the planner can make an informed decision between both alternatives. The model has been applied to thirteen practical cases covering a wide range of plantations with different density, purpose and average annual net income. Based on the results obtained, a k-means clustering is carried out to identify five groups according to their suitability for irrigation. The sensitivity of the model's input variables in respect to the threshold of seedling failure is also analized. Irrigation is profitable when the expected level of seedling failure is high and/or the value of the threshold decision is low. The latter is usually the case at afforestations that require a low acceptable level of seedling failure and/or in productive plantation forestry.","[Del Rio San Jose, Jorge] Junta Castilla & Leon, Delegac Terr Valladolid, Serv Terr Medio Ambiente, Duque Victoria 8, Valladolid 47001, Spain; [Reque Kilchenmann, Jose] Univ Valladolid, Inst Univ Gest Forestal Sostenible, ETS Ingn Agr Palencia, Avda Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain; [De Azagra Paredes, Andres Martinez] Univ Valladolid, Unidad Docente Hidraul & Hidrol, Dept Ingn Agr & Forestal, ETS Ingn Agr Palencia, Avda Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"San José, JD (通讯作者)，Junta Castilla & Leon, Delegac Terr Valladolid, Serv Terr Medio Ambiente, Duque Victoria 8, Valladolid 47001, Spain.",riosanjo@jcyl.es; requekch@pvs.uva.es; amap@iaf.uva.es,"Reque, José A/D-6806-2014","Martinez de Azagra Paredes, Andres/0000-0002-7627-7247; Del Rio San Jose, Jorge/0000-0001-8116-2930",,,,,121,1,1,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,18,29,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.007,0.0,,,12,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438180100003,0

Scholars debate to what extent the various actors will support LV, and whether LV will undermine private forest certification and higher standards due to operators' venue shopping. This paper explores Chinese wood enterprises' responses and discusses the implications for regime effectiveness. Based on primary data from 158 questionnaires and secondary data we find that, although the majority of the sampled export-oriented Chinese companies have heard about LV requirements, only few have detailed knowledge. Furthermore, they look to their customers' different requirements, and therefore often apply multiple measures simultaneously rather than do venue shopping. The question whether LV will undermine standards and certification therefore to a high extent bounces back to customers and import authorities. On the other hand, the Chinese companies consider the complexities of the timber regime a major constraint for meeting customers' requirements and therefore for own uptake and support. There is hence a need to reduce complexity in order to ensure regime effectiveness. We suggest this is best achieved by increased transparency of and alignment between the various LV regulations.","[Nathan, Iben; Hansen, Christian Pilegaard] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Chen, Jie; Xu, Bin; Li, Yan] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forestry Policy & Informat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","University of Copenhagen; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forestry Policy & Information, CAF","Nathan, I (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.;Xu, B (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forestry Policy & Informat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",in@ifro.ku.dk; cph@ifro.ku.dk; binxu@vip.sina.com,"Hansen, Christian Pilegaard/ABE-6060-2020; Hansen, Christian P/D-8226-2015; Nathan, Iben/E-1198-2015","Nathan, Iben/0000-0003-1879-4497",Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAF),Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAF),"We are grateful to the Chinese enterprises who contributed to our survey with their time and responses; to the Chinese Academy of Forestry (CAF), who provided funds for the survey; and to CAF and the Department of Food and Resource Economics at the University of Copenhagen for enabling the research.

We use a reform that simplified firm entry regulation in Portugal as a quasi-natural experiment and exploit its staggered implementation across municipalities for identification. Using employer-employee data, we find that increased competition following the reform raised total pay but reduced the sensitivity of pay to firm performance. This is consistent with theoretical results showing that a fall in entry costs weakens managerial incentive provision. Entry deregulation also increased performance-induced CEO turnover and firms' probability of exit, suggesting that competition provides direct incentives for managerial effort.","[Fernandes, Ana P.] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Ferreira, Priscila] Univ Minho, Econ, Braga, Portugal; [Ferreira, Priscila] NIMA, Braga, Portugal; [Winters, L.

In general, an increasing accept of the need for livelihood security, also for people living in or near natural conservation areas, are challenging traditional systems of national park governance. Finding ways to balance the needs of local populations against the necessity to secure biodiversity and environmental sustainability becomes important, and the main question in our research is how to accommodate an existing society in Baluran without a further negative impact on endangered mammals. Based on common pool resource management and co-management theories and thorough empirical investigations among the population living in Baluran, we conclude that alternative solutions exist for combining the interests of livelihood and conservation, but that resolute restrictions must be set by central government authorities, and that local institutions and livelihood practices must be developed based on experiences gained in the region through the last decades.

Accordingly, migrants are drawn from the lower half of the ability distribution. Higher wages and employment rates each account for around half the gains from migration.

While the effects of response time have been previously explored, this article proposes a different approach that explicitly recognizes the highly equivocal relationship between response time and respondents' choices. In particular, we attempt to disentangle preference, variance and processing heterogeneity and explore whether response time helps to explain these three types of heterogeneity. For this, we divide the data (ordered by response time) into approximately equal-sized subsets, and then derive different class membership probabilities for each subset. We estimate a large number of candidate models and subsequently conduct a frequentist-based model averaging approach using information criteria to derive weights of evidence for each model. Our findings show a clear link between response time and utility coefficients, error variance and processing strategies. Our results thus emphasize the importance of considering response time when modeling stated choice data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A systematic review was performed including model-based cost-effectiveness analyses of heart valve implantations. Study and model characteristics and cost-effectiveness results were extracted and the methodological quality was assessed using the Philips checklist. Fourteen decision-analytic models regarding the cost-effectiveness of heart valve implantations were identified. In most studies transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was cost-effective compared to standard treatment (ST) in inoperable or high-risk operable patients (ICER range 18,421-120,779 a,notsign) and in all studies surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) was cost-effective compared to ST in operable patients (ICER range 14,108-40,944 a,notsign), but the results were not consistent on the cost-effectiveness of TAVI versus SAVR in high-risk operable patients (ICER range: dominant to dominated by SAVR). Mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR) had the lowest costs per success compared to mitral valve repair and biological MVR. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate to good. This review showed that improvements can be made in the description and justification of methods and data sources, sensitivity analysis on extrapolation of results, subgroup analyses, consideration of methodological and structural uncertainty, and consistency (i.e. validity) of the models.

In 2016, FSC certified a total forest area of 195 Mha across 80 countries. While there is considerable room for expanding FSC's reach, there has been a lack of incentives for producers to seek certification, particularly in tropical countries. Information about existing barriers and challenges to comply with FSC standards are fundamental to promote such incentives. The objective of this study was to explore the main challenges faced by firms in the FSC certification process and discuss their policy implications. This was carried out by analyzing the quantity, spatial distribution, non-compliant principles, potential triggers and thematic areas of non-conformities (NCs) to FSC certification disclosed in the Public Summary Reports of third-party audits in Brazil. More specifically it tried to understand the specific issues to which the NCs were potentially associated to. This study generated descriptive and inferential statistics of a sample of 1086 NCs to FSC standards disclosed in the 110 Public Summary Reports, from which the overall majority were related to the certification of plantation forests that had gone through maintenance audits. The occurrence of NCs was found to be most frequently associated with FSC Principles 4 (26,07%), 6 (21,82%) and 8 (13,72%), which are related to the themes Community Relations and Worker's rights, Environmental Impact and Monitoring and Assessment, respectively. Many NCs were triggered by aspects of forest planning, operation and monitoring, which altogether accounted for 42.91% of all NCs. Problems related to occupational health and safety were also a relevant theme, accounting for almost 20% of the total non-conformities. Findings from the Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that auditors tended to identify similar NCs, regardless of the geographical region, of the type of forest and of the type of audit (certification or maintenance). Spearman Correlation tests indicated significant relationships between certified forest area and non-conformities with FSC Principles 4 and 7 (Community Relations and Worker's Rights, and Management Plans, respectively). The meaning of this relationship is unclear. Overall, findings corroborate previous studies that found FSC Principles 4 and 6 among the most challenging of the global FSC system. There seems to exist an opportunity for the development of stronger technical guidance and capacity building policies related to community relations, worker's rights, and environmental impacts. If such issues are already challenging in the context of large forest plantations, Brazilian policy-makers should expect small-scale firms to face even higher levels of difficulty, given their lack of financial and human resources. The study concludes by discussing its limitations and suggesting future research avenues.","[Rafael, Gabriel C.; Fonseca, Alberto] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Grad Program Environm Engn, Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil; [Goncalves Jacovine, Laercio Antonio] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Forest Engn, Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"Fonseca, A (通讯作者)，Campus Morro Cruzeiro S-N, BR-30330110 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil.",albertof@em.ufop.br,"Fonseca, Alberto/M-3425-2019","Fonseca, Alberto/0000-0002-6661-5185; Rafael, Gabriel C./0000-0003-1630-1281",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [310758/2015-7],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The authors are grateful to all people and organizations who somehow contributed to this research.

Current displays of death where the past is exhibited and consumed as fun, scary and as entertainment productions are widespread. The movie industry provides horror to all ages, children can be exposed to the goulash past in various forms, such as the popular book series 'Horrible Histories'. Theme parks, rides and roller-coaster often take a dark and scary approach to enticing consumers. Another popular and well established product (especially in western societies) are fun factories' (Stone, 2009), such as the dungeon attractions owned by the Merlin Entertainment Group. The market for death and horror based attractions and entertainment is growing. Since the dawn of time death has been a guarantee that awaits us all. Society is well connected to death, however and significantly, the consumption of death and its social transformation historically to present, both in practice and meaning have changed, evolved and continue to do so. The meaning, practice and consumption of death and its evolution into the future will be a significant representation of future societies. This paper, considers how society is moving into a new period, the 'spectacle of death'. By researching and understanding past and present social realities, it is possible to generate knowledge, ideas and predictions of the future, in this study, the future role of death as tourism entertainment. This paper presents original and challenging potential future scenarios in which tourists engage with death as a form of entertainment, around the year 2100. Uniquely, the paper considers the use of horrific and tragic events that have overwhelmed the world in the early 21 Century (including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York). Accordingly, presenting innovative narratives exposing how these will become spectacles of death in a 'terror park; a lighter form of dark entertainment in the future.","[Wright, Daniel William Mackenzie] Univ Cent Lancashire, Greenbank Bldg,Victoria St, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Wright, DWM (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Lancashire, Greenbank Bldg,Victoria St, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",Dwright3@uclan.ac.uk,"Wright, Daniel/JCO-8008-2023",,,,,,123,10,10,0,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,FEB,2018,96.0,,,,,,1,22,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.11.002,0.0,,,22,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FX4EB,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426024400001,0

The results confirmed the relationship between social capital and involvement of inhabitants in the community affairs. Verification of the existence of a relationship between the involvement in the commune affairs (social capital component) and the education of the respondents was verified. The research results indicate the diversity of involvement in level of education groups. The respondents with a minimum level of secondary education noted a positive average level of involvement, which means that they showed more interest in commune matters and willingness to get involved in them. The highest level of involvement was noted in the group of people with post-secondary education. Respondents with basic vocational and elementary and gymnasial education more often showed lack of involvement in the commune's affairs, and thus they recorded negative average results of engagement.","[Bedzik, Beata; Golab, Sylwia] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Fac Econ, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Bedzik, B; Golab, S (通讯作者)，Zolnierska 47, PL-71210 Szczecin, Poland.",beata.bedzik@zut.pl; sylwia.golab@zut.pl,"Gołąb, Sylwia/J-4858-2016; Będzik, Beata/H-4911-2016","Gołąb, Sylwia/0000-0002-6572-9201; Będzik, Beata/0000-0003-1052-0977",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,280,286,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.37,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600037,0

Specifically, on the basis of data from the fifth round of Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS V), we have investigated the existence of possible complementarities between various types of innovation modes (product, process and non-technological (marketing and/or organizational) innovations) in their impact on the firm's productivity. The study reveals complementarity between the following two combinations of innovations: product/process and process/non-technological innovations. Further, the results of the study show that only those combinations of innovation modes that assume all the types of innovations and/or the combination of process and non-technological innovations have positive and statistically significant impact on the firm's productivity. In the paper, we account for the simultaneous occurrence of different types of innovation inputs-in-house knowledge generation and out-house knowledge acquisition activities- and estimate their joint effects on various modes of innovation. The study results suggest that implementation of internal research and development (R&D) strategy can stimulate not only technological innovations but non-technological innovative activity as well. However, we find that external knowledge acquisition strategy has positive and statistically significant effect on innovation output only when the firm's innovation mix incorporates non-technological novelties.","[Berulava, George; Gogokhia, Teimuraz] I Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, P Gugushvili Inst Econ, Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Berulava, G (通讯作者)，I Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, P Gugushvili Inst Econ, Tbilisi, Georgia.",george.berulava@gmail.com; temurgogokhia1976@gmail.com,"Gogokhia, Teimuraz/JXN-8239-2024; Berulava, George/AAM-5587-2021; Berulava, George/Q-7919-2019","Berulava, George/0000-0002-1655-0205;",,,,,45,4,4,5,17,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,169,192,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_34,0.0,,,24,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500011,0

In the present context the traditional views on formation of the regional innovative systems are subject to review. Most efficiently this process is arranged within a triple spiral model. This paper presents the content of the triple spiral model, analyzes actors' motivation for implementing innovations and a networking cooperation. It is concluded that regional actors exert influence on intensity and forms of universities, businesses and government involvement into the processes, as well as on aspects of using knowledge and technology transfer. A hypothesis was formulated, that in case of creation a mechanism of cooperation between all the actors of the triple spiral - university, government and business - innovative ventures in the engineering-industrial center of the Russian Far East might receive more rapid development. In order to confirm the hypothesis, mechanisms and forms of university involvement into the mentioned processes, current issues and limitations, aspects of using knowledge and technology transfer on the territory of advanced development Komsomolsk are studied. Based on the analysis a significant role of a technical university in development of innovative ventures on the territory of advanced development Komsomolsk is justified. It is determined by three types of interaction with enterprises of innovative cluster in Khabarovsk region: implementation of educational programs in priority fields of study, refresher course and advanced professional training; conduct of applied research together with businesses; shared use of university's innovative infrastructure. It is proved that networking cooperation within the school community while using innovative infrastructure enables to form in the region a long-standing link on reformation and creation of scientific knowledge into a new and revised product (technology). This research is aimed to explain an intentional development of an innovative system in the region based on the triple spiral model. The authors have carried out an analysis of networking cooperation in the process of knowledge exchange (transfer) between the actors of innovative infrastructure of university and region.

Based on the scenario analysis and the priorities of the Turkish economy, given the employment benefits and energy savings which would reduce the energy demand in the area in the peak season, we propose that the government implements green consumer loans for retrofitting through the state-owned banks.","[Celik, Serdar] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 61 Circle Dr, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Binatli, Ayla Ogus] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Celik, S (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 61 Circle Dr, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",scelik@siue.edu,"binatli, ayla ogus/AAD-1794-2019; binatli, ayla ogus/A-2699-2013","binatli, ayla ogus/0000-0002-8291-0010;",,,,,60,9,9,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Three proxies for CSR engagement are constructed by a firm's inclusion in the SSE Social Responsibility Index. Empirical evidence generally shows that firms engaging in CSR tend to obtain superior performance in terms of higher profitability. However, firm's age and sound corporate governance have little additional benefit on the effect of a firm engaging in CSR on performance. Finally, greater CSR engagement is associated with larger PPS. Principal outcome does not shift under two-stage estimation and propensity score matching (PSM) to correct for sample self-selection of CSR engagement.","[Chang, Yuan; Shu, Min-Cheng] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Finance, Bao Shan Campus,2 Shi Da Rd, Changhua 500, Taiwan; [Chen, Ting-Hsuan] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",National Changhua University of Education; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chang, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Dept Finance, Bao Shan Campus,2 Shi Da Rd, Changhua 500, Taiwan.",ccuecon@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,66,15,16,2,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The formulation of the transfer pricing problem considers costs and taxes in a vertically integrated supply chain. We conceptualize the transfer pricing as a multi-objective problem and present a method for finding the strong Nash equilibrium that maximizes the utility of the entire multidivisional firm. The approach consists on determining a scalar lambda*and the corresponding strategies v* (lambda*) fixing specific bounds on the Pareto front. Bounds correspond to restrictions imposed by each division over the Pareto front that determine the maximum and minimum transfer price legally authorized. For ensuring the existence of a unique strong Nash equilibrium, we employ a penalized regularization method for poly-linear functions. We implement a recurrent procedure for finding the extremal point. For finding the strong Nash equilibrium, we select the Pareto optimal strong strategy v*(lambda*)with minimal distance to the utopia point. We show that the regularized functional of the game decreases and converges, proving the existence and uniqueness of strong Nash equilibrium. The usefulness of the method is successfully demonstrated by a numerical example.","[Clempner, Julio B.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Poznyak, Alexander S.] Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Clempner, JB (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",julio@clempner.name; apoznyak@ctrl.cinvestay.mx,"Poznyak, Alexander/U-1729-2019",,,,,,25,7,7,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

However, there is a view that citizens in most other regions don't have as many opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the e-participation practices in regional and local government agencies in the Volgograd region in order to develop measures for improvement of the existing system. The study utilizes the following two methods: analysis of e-participation modes offered by regional and local governments and an expert survey. The survey was completed by 48 regional and local government officials responsible for information policy. The findings can be summarized as follows. All existing regional platforms provide opportunities to give feedback or ask questions related to the city's life. The local government website gives opportunities to participate in surveys that help to accumulate users' opinions and improve the quality of life in the city. On the other hand, the studied platforms do not provide collaborative tools (chat, shared agenda, forum, etc.). Their main aim is to give information, but not to involve citizens in decision-making processes. The experts evaluated the level of e-participation in the Volgograd region and identified the most important challenges. It has been concluded that citizens in the Volgograd region have fewer possibilities to participate in decision-making processes than citizens of the country in general. Among the variety of electronic services developed in Europe and the United States only a few (the least interactive as a rule) exist in Russia at the regional level. The most important problem highlighted by a majority of the experts (75%) is lack of clear and detailed e-participation strategy developed in the region. It has been reported that there is a need for developing this strategy at the regional and local level and citizens should be engaged in this discussion process. The other identified obstacles are the insufficient activity of citizens, lack of transparency in the local governments, and the complexity of e-services. Based on the investigations of this paper the following areas of improvement in this field can be proposed: development of an e-participation strategy in the region with citizen involvement in this process, enhancement of the existing e-participation services proposed by regional and local governments and adoption of new services, development of collaborative tools on existing platforms, simplification of e-services, using benefits of social advertising and social media.","[Demushina, Olga] Russian Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, 8 Gagarina St, Volgograd 400131, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Demushina, O (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, 8 Gagarina St, Volgograd 400131, Russia.",Olga-demushina@yandex.ru,"Demushina, Olga/H-8330-2017",,,,,,29,0,1,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1283,1294,,,,,,12,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200109,0

From the perspective of balance sheet law the initiation of the innovation process requires that the enterprise separate research work from development work. The classification of conducted work as well as the assessment of their results becomes a key issue. Classification of work in the framework of R & D activity due to the technical and production criterion was adopted as binding in the balance sheet law, thus determining the principles of recognizing costs under the financial accounting. Research costs are incurred at the stage prior to development phase. From the Polish Accounting Act and IAS 38 point of view it is possible to capitalize only the costs of development work after specified conditions have been met.

To do this, I present an ethnographic study of environmental reverse auctions conducted in Cidanau, Indonesia. I invert the question of how economic assumptions transform environmental management decisions to specific practical challenges and their resolution as revealed in decisions taken by auction organizers, such as where to conduct the auction, how many participants are needed to engender competition, which exchanges among competing participants to restrict, how to organize facilitators, and what to announce to encourage strategic bidding. In contrast to sociological theories of auctions or the microeconomic model of individual competition, specific attributes of the auction's materiality, such as the design of bid slips, sealed bids, announcements of winners, and the multi-round auction structure, sustain the performance of competition. A paradoxical tension emerges in the process of auction organizing, wherein sticking to the auction script necessitates working around it. Building on ethnomethodological studies of economic activities, I argue for a need to go beyond studying how auctions are socio-materially performed and instead study how the performance is demonstrated as adequately accountable for the concerns at hand.","[Ghosh, Ritwick] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Ghosh, R (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",rg535@cornell.edu,,,"Institute of Social Sciences, Cornell University; Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies in Cornell University","Institute of Social Sciences, Cornell University; Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies in Cornell University","This work was supported by the Institute of Social Sciences, Cornell University; Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies in Cornell University.",,74,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Under the assumption that the pass-through effect of the exchange rate changes on prices is high and that goods subject to foreign trade are elastic, depreciation or appreciation of the national currency is expected to affect the terms of trade by setting the relative export price. This study investigate the existence of co-integration and causality relationship between the real effective exchange rate and terms of trade in Turkey for the period 2010-2017. The results demonstrated the existence of a long-term co-integration relationship between terms of trade and real effective exchange rate.

In other words, it was found that both the changes in the real effective foreign exchange rates affect the external terms of trade and the changes in the external terms of trade affect the real effective foreign exchange rate.","[Gunes, Sevcan; Yildirim, Canan] Pamukkale Univ, Denizli, Turkey",Pamukkale University,"Günes, S (通讯作者)，Pamukkale Univ, Denizli, Turkey.",sgunes@pau.edu.tr; cananizzzm@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,UNIV WISMAR,WISMAR,"PHILIPP-MULLER-STRASSE 14, WISMAR, 23966, GERMANY",,,978-3-942100-56-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,96,102,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN0CA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000472641400012,0

But the housing problem is one of the most pressing problems in the contemporary society. The scale of the problem is large and the forms of its manifestation differ, depending on natural-climatic and socioeconomic environment of the country. Methods of the housing problem solving, the forms of central and local authorities' participation, the extent and mechanisms of financial support depend on certain situation. The main factors are the level of economic development of the country; standard of living, availability and afford-ability of housing; state of the housing stock; mortgage lending development; terms of residential mortgage loans; state of housing construction sphere; features of the legislation regulating the housing sector. Though some features of contemporary housing problem in CEE countries have common genesis the others are specific and formed in previous period as well as in transition. The objective of the current paper is to compare of the main features characterizing the housing problem and the ways of its solving in CEE countries. Research methodology includes analysis of theoretical and applied scientific publications on financial-economic aspects of the housing problem and analysis of official statistics by comparisons and identifying structural and tempo proportions. The data of Eurostat are used. The study considers the theoretical positions related to the economic and financial aspects of the housing problem, implements the analysis of the current situation and trends of the housing problem in CEE countries. The explanation of some differences is suggested and recommendations for practical application of theoretical positions are made.","[Guzikova, Liudmila A.; Plotnikova, Ekaterina V.] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm & Financial Management, St Petersburg, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,"Guzikova, LA (通讯作者)，Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm & Financial Management, St Petersburg, Russia.",guzikova@mail.ru; katrusia_91@mail.ru,"Koroleva, Ekaterina/E-8256-2019; Guzikova, Liudmila Aleksandrovna Aleksandrovna/M-7075-2013",,,,,,9,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,193,205,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_12,0.0,,,13,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500012,0

Yet, when it comes to the application of its Common Commercial Policy, the EU has been treating the two cases differently. With respect to Israel, the EU determined that the 1995 EU-Israel Association Agreement is not applicable to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, thereby denying Israel any trade benefits with respect to the Territories, whereas for many years it insisted that its 1996 Association Agreement with Morocco is applicable to occupied Western Sahara, thereby enabling Morocco and Moroccan corporations to enjoy trade benefits with respect to Western Sahara. The willingness of the EU to pursue its CCP vis-a-vis Morocco and Western Sahara (de facto application with no de jure recognition) in a manner inconsistent with, if not contradictory to its practice towards Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip (no application and no recognition), raised much criticism. In December 2016 the European Court of Justice adopted a verdict that rejects the applicability of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement to Western Sahara (The Front Polisario Verdict). This article aims to (1) analyse the gap between the EU's trade policy and practice in these two cases and the legal and other implications thereof, and (2) address the question whether the verdict in Front Polisario eliminates this gap. Within this context, the article analyses the interface between the CCP and international law. In tackling these themes, the article will contribute, more broadly, to scholarship dealing with the interface between public international law (including issues of statehood, occupation and self-determination) and international trade, with specific reference to the applicability of international trade agreements to disputed and occupied territories.","[Harpaz, Guy] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, European Law, Law Fac, Jerusalem, Israel; [Harpaz, Guy] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Harpaz, G (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, European Law, Law Fac, Jerusalem, Israel.;Harpaz, G (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Int Relat, Jerusalem, Israel.",guy.harpaz@mail.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,34,3,3,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This paper uses the introduction of plastic packaging into food markets in the post-Second World War Australia to pursue this question. This empirical foray is informed by recent debates about the 'government of things' and explorations about how political and ontological processes interact. Making plastic packaging into a mundane market device involved the development of accountability relations that established the 'responsibilities' of the package: what it was obliged to do across various networks from production to self-service. Equally important were processes that attached consumers to this new material and provoked changed practices. This history shows how the normalisation of plastic packaging changed the ontological status of food in markets. Plastic provided a new point of articulation between the natural and the synthetic in relation to governing the life of food that also conditioned the governance of consumers: convincing them that food wrapped in plastic was better across numerous registers. What the case of mundane plastic packaging shows is that 'government' does not exist first and enrol technologies to achieve its aims. Rather, that devices and technologies can become capable of introducing new conducts into markets and everyday life.","[Hawkins, Gay] Western Sydney Univ, Inst Culture & Soc, Social & Cultural Theory, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Hawkins, G (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Inst Culture & Soc, Social & Cultural Theory, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",g.hawkins@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Hawkins, Gay/0000-0002-9057-6729",Australian Research Council Discovery Program [DP130101249],Australian Research Council Discovery Program(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery Program (DP130101249).,,28,35,36,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In their complexity, the present economic phenomena bring to the human decident an increasing amount of data with particular volumes and structures characteristic of the types of processes represented, so the process of decision making becomes a particularly difficult, interdisciplinary task, the human responsible is required a high standard of professional training. Any economic organization that proposes in its developing strategies to maximize generated added value and profitability, should develop at the level of I .T . compartment policies and methods of prevailing, managing and storing information as effectively and optimally as possible. Compressing this data without losses and preserving its quality is one of the arguments that make the difference in an economy of the successful decisional-management competition. We present in this paper, possibilities of saving the memory spaces allocated to the information used in the operational processes, possibly later extrapolated strategically, with a percentage rate of 20%, up to 90%, depending on the dependence on the type and characteristics of the compressed data in the studied processes. For operational, concrete cases, solutions such as variable length code tables are proposed, thus source code symbols are coded, whose interpretation is essential in developing optimized managerial decision generating organizational performance. In this paradigm of approach, the data used is perceived as character sequences, with the HUFFMAN Code algorithm developed, the approach selected in the study is a succession of tabloid structures, is developed step by step, the optimal way of representation to each character as a binary string. For a top organizational decisional-manager this is a competitive alternative in developing an improved, efficient and successful decision-making process. The selected example involves the design of a binary code, in which each character is represented by a string, also binary, unique. The selected operation, a business model used in an economy of performance, substantiates the structures within the HUFFMAN Code.","[Ionescu, Marian Sorin] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Ionescu, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania.",marian.ionescu@man.ase.ro,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,868,880,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200074,0

Tesla Motors Inc., that has developed the most efficient and long-lasting batteries for the manufacture of its electric vehicles, belongs to companies that are most sensitive to a change of cobalt and lithium prices. The aim of this paper is to examine effects of cobalt and lithium price fluctuations on volatility of Tesla Motors Inc. shares. In order to model mutual relationships between cobalt and lithium prices shocks and Tesla Motors Inc. volatility, we utilized the DCC GARCH model. Empirical analysis is provided on daily data in the period of 2013 - 2017 years.

This is a fairly young scientific discipline, but it has been growing fast in recent years and its importance is growing. The issue of logistics is paid considerable attention at present time. This is mainly due to the development of the market environment, which increases the competition, but also provided the higher demands of the customers on the quality of the services. Due to the proper implementation and operation of logistics processes, the company can achieve competitive advantage. Logistics processes need to be mutually supportive to act synergistically to achieve the set goals. The aim of this article is to use ABC analysis as a management method in the rationalization of selected logistic warehousing processes in the two chosen companies. The ABC analysis method is a well-established categorization scientific method based on the Pareto principle for determining items that should be prioritized in company inventory management.

The main purpose of the study is to identify common/similar characteristics of managers in different countries and differences, as well as building of typology of countries on the basis of socio-demographic and economic characteristics of managers. The surveys hypotheses were tested using the ANOVA mean module analysis and the Chi-square criterion. In addition, groups of countries with similar characteristics were identified by hierarchical cluster analysis. As a result of the study, there were obtained the average characteristics of managers in European countries, which reflect the specifics of the organization of labor, the development of social and labor relations, the career of managers in these countries.","[Lapina, Tatiana; Stuken, Tatiana] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Mira 55-A, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Lapina, T (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, Mira 55-A, Omsk 644077, Russia.",Lapinaomgu@gmail.com; Stuken@mail.ru,"Lapina, Tatyana A./G-6635-2013; Stuken, Tatiana/H-6777-2016",,,,,,14,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1038,1047,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400104,0

The results reveal a positive relationship between IPA's performance and longer experience, larger staff, larger overseas IPA staff members, autonomous private agency types, and upper ministry-level IPAs. However, an IPA's performance was negatively associated with the combined promotional service of inward investment and trade, and inward and outward investment.

The Spanish context is characterized by decentralization of public responsibility to a greater extent than in neighboring countries, feeding the debate on the operational efficiency of local government and the importance of gender in public management. Results show that councils with women mayors have lower annual interest and debt repayment obligations and have higher expenditure on security, protection, and social promotion. Thus, the presence of women in politics may serve to improve councils' economic situations, which is necessary not only for social justice but also for economic efficiency. In addition, in councils with more inhabitants, women mayors are more common, but women are less likely to occupy the office for longer periods.","[Maria Hernandez-Nicolas, Carmen] Univ Murcia, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Francisco Martin-Ugedo, Juan] Univ Murcia, Corp Finance, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Minguez-Vera, Antonio] Univ Murcia, Financial Econ, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia; University of Murcia; University of Murcia,"Hernández-Nicolás, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",cm.hernandeznicolas@um.es; juanfran@um.es; minver@um.es,"Minguez-Vera, Antonio/Z-5658-2019",,Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain) [FEM2013-40578-P]; Fundacion CajaMurcia,Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain); Fundacion CajaMurcia,This research is part of the project FEM2013-40578-P financed by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain).

Our research is focused on a quantitative approach content analysis, by taking into consideration the ratings of FTSE Russell and MSCI considering Romania's country classification. The results of our study indicate that despite the positive changes, Romania's rating as a frontier market implies a set of challenges that Romania must face in order to become an emergent capital market: free and well-developed equity market- market accessibility and facilities for international investors and liquidity. A very important criterion for Romania to achieve the emergent capital market status is represented by listing new public (such as Hidroelectrica and the National Company Bucharest Airports) & private IPO.

These predictions have been hypothesizing to be linked with the reality of the labor market. Therefore, an analysis of the basic labor market indicators in relation to the above is also included. This paper shows the importance of understanding potential psychological sources both to public policy and business viewpoints. If certain countries exhibit psychological traits that support income inequality, the psychological set-up of people themselves may be the reason why some countries are not achieving economic growth in even in long run. On these bases, it is argued that understanding the relationship between personality traits, which were found in all cultures, and income inequality have significant policy implications. It suggests that there are strong differences in egalitarian believes and perception of pathological behavior between countries.","[Obergruber, Petr] Italska 36-25, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic; [Obergruber, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Obergruber, P (通讯作者)，Italska 36-25, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic.;Obergruber, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",petr.grub@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1273,1286,,,,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400126,0

First, we evaluate the average connectedness of oil price with the Korean domestic variables over the precrisis period. We then investigate the time-varying contribution of oil price to the Korean financial and real sectors during and after the global financial crisis through recursive estimation. It is found that the contribution of oil price becomes very large in the case of real exports, equity prices, and real output, but plays a much less prevalent role in the remaining cases. In the meantime, the time-varying contribution of oil price to the Korean economy has not changed during and after the global financial crisis. Interestingly, we find that the Korean economy is affected mostly by overseas financial conditions in the short-term but it becomes more susceptible to oil price fluctuations in the long run, suggesting that Korea's reliance on energy imports leaves the economy exposed to volatility in energy prices.","[Park, Hail] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Shin, Yongcheol] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England",Kyung Hee University; University of York - UK,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",hailpark@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The Forestry plans of the subjects of the Russian Federation (i.e. regions) were defined in the 2006 Forest Code in documents for forestry planning. However, while the regional forestry plans reflect forest management projects, they do not provide the economic landmarks suitable for the effective development of the forestry sector. These forestry plans are also proving insufficient to serve as tools to assess the effectiveness of the powers delegated to the regions of the Russian Federation. Based on the forestry plans of the Sverdlovsk Region, the authors believe it necessary to prepare, in the near future, a working document on the regional strategic planning of the development of the total forestry sector, built on the principles of business planning.

The article therefore examines if and how LGB(TI)Qs are being counted and, importantly, what it means if queers are counted.","[Schoenpflug, Karin] Inst Adv Studies IHS, Dept Secur & Stabil, Vienna, Austria; [Klapeer, Christine M.] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Gender Studies, Gottingen, Germany; [Hofmann, Roswitha] Uebergrenzendenken Forsch & Wissenschaftl Beratun, Vienna, Austria; [Muellbacher, Sandra] Austrian Minist Finance, Vienna, Austria",University of Gottingen,"Schönpflug, K (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies IHS, Dept Secur & Stabil, Vienna, Austria.",karin.schoenpflug@ihs.ac.at; christine.klapeer@uni-goettingen.de; office@uebergrenzendenken.at; sandra.muellbacher@bmf.gv.at,"Schönpflug, Karin/GPX-1985-2022","Schoenpflug, Karin/0000-0002-6511-9817",Austrian National Bank's Jubilaumsfonds [14170],Austrian National Bank's Jubilaumsfonds,This work was supported by the Austrian National Bank's Jubilaumsfonds [grant number 14170].,,85,4,5,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In this paper is analysed the current situation in the EU and politic thoughts of young first-graders in the University of Economics in Prague, in the Czech Republic. This research is based on a questionnaire which contains 10 questions on economic issues, with a special regard to the EU. The subjective views that come from 61 respondents, were anonymized, evaluated and extended by statistical data from the available statistical databases from the Czech Republic. 34 (55,7%) of the respondents were men, their average age was about 20 years and 42 (68,9%) of them were born in a bigger city (calc. 50 000+ people). The first question was whether the respondents had participated in the election to Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic in 2017 or not. Over 60% of them voted. The assumption of their interest in politics has been confirmed. Students responded that they would cooperate with the USA/UK rather than with France/Germany. On the other hand, it was surprising that most of the students selected Emmanuel Macron as the best president. One of the main problems today is the migration crisis, which these days has become a dominant part of populism, was another question of the survey. I have to admit that the responses to the questions were strictly profiled (yes or no), therefore more than 80% of students answered that they are against migration policy of the EU. This result is due to the rising Euroscepticism and fear that spreads across whole Europe. Maybe that's why only 54% students chose to stay in the EU and the rest calls for its reformation (6,6%) or become again an autonomous sovereign state (39,3%). Next two questions were concerned with positive and negative impacts of the EU. As the greatest positive impact was selected the free movement of persons and the free market. Many of them cannot differentiate between the EU and Schengen Treaties. Among the negative impacts belong bureaucracy (35%), regulations and directives (31%) and migration policy (30%). The last two questions focused on the subsidy policy. These results show that perception of the EU subsidy policy are again balanced (50/50), i.e. one group of respondents is happy that we are using the EU structural funds but the other one is neutral or negative concerning this issue.","[Spetlik, Vaclav] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spetlík, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic.",xspev05@vse.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1755,1763,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400174,0

The results of building a city or region identity determine economic and social sustainability, competitiveness, real estate market or demographic development. Municipal management often resigns from active policy setting of housing. Housing is, however, the key function of the city. Although the tools of strategic planning of cities are not all-powerful, in long-term horizon they can be cleverly using for brand and reputation building and location value growing. The identity of the city (district) influences the quality of life of its inhabitants. Maintaining an attractive community identity depends directly on the smart direction of development and the ability to influence the physical space and urban character in the locality. The reality of public investments management and processes of negotiation with developers often ignores the long-term strategic public interest of the city and only address economic aspects and limits of the master plan. Other qualitative aspects of public investments are excluded usually from considerations, and the way to develop brand is seen just in PR campaigns rather than the quality of city development. This article reflects a case study of one of the edge of the capital city of Prague - Kolovraty. The management of the Prague - Kolovraty district prepared a strategic plan in cooperation with the Czech Technical University in Prague. A key paradigm of this strategic plan is the effort to preserve the identity of the city and its goodwill.","[Stepanek, Petr] Czech Tech Univ, Kolejni 2a, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Stepánek, P (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Kolejni 2a, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic.",petr.stepanek@cvut.cz,,,Technology Agency of the CR -Eta programme,Technology Agency of the CR -Eta programme,The paper presents partial results of the research project (supported by Technology Agency of the CR -Eta programme) Sustainable and affordable housing in strategic urban planning processed at Czech Technical University in Prague.

As a result, author identifies four key perspectives that play important role in usage of social media: international advertising, role of culture, role of technology and traditional vs. social media perspective. These perspectives are furtherly discussed and possible areas for future development, together with its limitations are identified. All these perspectives show the importance of social media topic and why it should not be overlooked. Practical implications might be seen mainly by managers who deal with social media. Managers might get inspired by these perspectives, use its opportunities and be aware of its limitations in order to create successful international online marketing campaigns.

As a response, new kind of economic policy called macro-prudential policy has been created to safeguard financial stability. Monetary policy principles have remained unchanged and firmly focused on inflation targets. The decade of ultra-loose monetary policy has been driven by low output, low productivity and threat of deflation as being justified by policy makers. At the same time, during previous decade, the notion of fourth industrial revolution (digital revolution) has been increasingly discussed. Once this phenomenon is at least partly accepted, the problems with measurement of macroeconomic indicators have been gaining on importance. Under new economic circumstances, output and productivity may be undervalued shedding different light to the nature of too low inflation and growth. The phenomenon of deflation should be revisited in modern macroeconomics with special attention paid to how address the issue of present quite low inflationary environment in current monetary policy frameworks without side effects. Such a deeper understanding would help to strike a delicate balance between the risk of overreaction, on the one hand, and of insufficient preemptiveness, on the other one. The debate about whether monetary policy should or should not lean against the wind had started as early as in Seventies and might be useful to be revisited as well. At the same time, monetary policy rule incorporating at least some monetary or financial stability indicators may be more efficient than the current status quo.","[Zamrazilova, Eva] Czech Fiscal Council, Holeckova 103-31, Prague 15000, Czech Republic",,"Zamrazilová, E (通讯作者)，Czech Fiscal Council, Holeckova 103-31, Prague 15000, Czech Republic.",Eva.Zamrazilova@unrr.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [17-02509S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Financial support from the Czech Science Foundation (Project No. GA 17-02509S) is gratefully acknowledged.,,16,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,2001,2013,,,,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400199,0

The forests that provide these ecosystem services are managed by a multitude of forest owners. Different forest owners have their own objectives and will thus adjust their forest management differently to socioeconomic developments. The FoLDS framework breaks down the connection from socio-economic developments to the landscape level in three steps. In the first step, a structure is provided for deciding on scenarios combining the socio-economic factors that have most influence on forest owners. In the second step, the scenarios are translated to the distribution of forest management approaches in the landscape by invoking a behavioural matrix of forest owner types and forest management decisions. The third step involves the implementation of these forest management approaches in a forest modelling tool that is tailored to the specific landscape at hand. The results of these calculations are then translated to a set of indicators for the ecosystem services of interest A survey among researchers experienced with the FoLDS framework indicates that there is an added value in systematically including both qualitative and quantitative scenario methods for forested landscapes.

We aimed to estimate WTP for health status with different severity level and identify determinant factors on WTP. For determining main factors in WTP, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Shiraz in the southeast of Iran, in March to April 2015. The open-ended method was used to estimate monthly WTP in private and altruistic section. Multivariate regression analyses using ordinary least squares were applied to examine the effect of Scio-demographic factors on WTP using SPSS software 21. Participants were willing to pay an average amount of $ 295 in health status 1 and an average amount of $ 596 in health status 6 (worst status) for internal preferences. Altruistic WTP for health status 1 was $ 294 and participants were willing to pay an average amount of $ 416 in health status 6. Multiple regression analysis identified monthly income as the key determinant of WTP for internal preferences and caring externalities (P < 0.01). With an increase of 1% in income, private WTP increase 1.38% in health status 1.

Eutrophication is a widespread problem threatening the biodiversity and usability of waters. Unfortunately, the means to alleviate eutrophication are either difficult to realize, inefficient, or effective only on the short-term. In addition, the use of various means is laden with interests, contradictory values and cultural goals, which further complicate the wicked problem of eutrophication and lake management. To scrutinize the problem, a two-round, international Delphi study was carried out. This paper uncovers lake experts' views on how eutrophic lakes will and should be managed and restored in the future up to 2030. Through cluster analysis, the variety of the views of the experts was condensed into five coherent future images: Business as Usual, Let's Heal the Lakes, No More Nutrient Discharges, Back to Nature, and Dystopia. The Delphi panel evaluated the Business as Usual as the most probable and the Let's Heal the Lakes as the most preferred of the future images. In this paper, we discuss the future images, their preconditions and policy requirements.

Thus, teaching foundational microeconomic concepts to millennials could be very challenging. This paper proposes an attractive method to improve millennials' learning experience by projecting short YouTube movie clips (3 minutes on average) in the classroom. The clips were not specifically uploaded to YouTube for a microeconomics lecture; they were already available on YouTube as movie scenes. The objective of the apparent absence of connection between the clip and the lecture is to inspire students' interest, which helps to involve millennial students in the lecture by giving them a real-world emphasis and they can improve their understanding. This short break in the lecture contributes to engage millennials by giving them a focus using social media. The results of a student self-assessment survey support the expectations of the literature that the use of YouTube clips would improve students' assimilation of economic concepts by helping them realize how economics is applicable to the real world, enhancing their internalization of those notions, and recognizing the relevance of economic ideas to their lives.

The oversupply of facts in science for governance is explained as a matter of complexity, defined as irreducible pluralism in the knowledge base. The paper shows how complexity provides an interface to engage with the multiple facts of science through three different examples. First, water narratives are used to show how different scales of analysis produce contradictory scientific representations of the same system. Second, smart electricity grids are assessed to demonstrate how different levels of uncertainty are associated with different representations. Third, the case of slum upgrading is used to discuss the need to take into account stakes in science for governance. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

After examining mean-based compression ratios, we estimate salary percentiles and explore stochastic dominance relationships between estimated salary distributions for different disciplines and professorial ranks. Although salary compression is not seen in most academic disciplines, it is prevalent in business-related disciplines, is increasing in these disciplines, and exhibits examples of stochastic dominance. In addition, salary compression increases as competing nonacademic salaries increase. Finally, we evaluate our methodology, showing that it would likely be useful in a variety of settings.

First, I will describe Japanese commitment to PNS, which consists of a part of the long history of the Japanese response to European citizens' science/technology movement, in the framework of the introduction of Post-Normal Science in East Asia. Then I will re-examine the relationship between techno-science and democracy after 3/11 Japan, where triple disaster has radically changed the relationship between science/technology and society, and hence the very nature of Japan as a democratic society. Japan had been returning to an authoritarian state and technocratic nation in the aftermath of 3/11. As for the citizens' sphere, since 3/11, Japanese society has been badly divided; in fact, the current division of Japanese society is as bad as that of the Trumpian US. I have applied several conceptual tools to analyze this post-3/11 situation of Japan, that it was created by a combination of 'disaster capitalism' (a concept described by Naomi Klein (2008)), and 'normalcy bias'. The new political climate in post-3/11 Japan results in part from the politics of emergency, and partly from the manipulation and distortion of democracy. From the viewpoint of democracy and science, cases of thyroid cancer in Fukushima and its surroundings are a serious and even pathetically painful issue. One hundred seventy two children in and around Fukushima have already had their thyroids removed in surgical operations. But any suggestion of causality between the Fukushima incident and thyroid cancer is officially rejected. It is announced by the authority's voice that radioactivity risk is safe, take it, because risk creates chance, like the proclamation given in the novel 1984 by George Orwell. Behind this is another historical psychology, that Japan has overcome Hiroshima and Nagasaki and made a great success in economic development. Post 3/11 Japan is judged as not a good place to discuss science and technology in a deliberate manner supported by a reasonable deniocracy with mutual understanding and value-free examination of techno-science in action. But, in this time of serious social divide and political populism, can PNS and a citizens' science approach now lead the way to fill in the gap? Are there any lessons from PNS that can be applied to post3/11 Japan? The question is still open.","[Tsukahara, Togo] Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University,"Tsukahara, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",byz06433@nifty.com,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K01163, 16H03116] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,19,6,6,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2017,91.0,,,,SI,,84,89,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.008,0.0,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FJ3DL,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412610600012,0

We propose a stylized model of intergenerational decision making on SRM research, greenhouse-gas abatement and SRM deployment, under uncertainties about (a) the extent of future climate damage and (b) effectiveness and potential harmful side-effects of SRM. Open-ended research may reveal either that SRM effectively reduces climate damage, or that it would cause more harm than benefits. We find that SRM research increases the likelihood of deployment (slippery slope), and derive conditions that it decreases abatement effort in expectation (moral hazard). Neither of these provides a rationale against SRM research, though. The rational decision is to perform SRM research, unless (i) discounting is hyperbolic and (0) the absolute prudence of expected climate damage is smaller than absolute risk aversion. These results generalize to the case where SRM research also provides information on dimate sensitivity. (C) 2017 The Authors.

However, the negative signalling effect seems to be much weaker in a group of clients of job-coaching services who acquired their disability during their working life.","[Deuchert, Eva; Kauer, Lukas] Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Disabil & Integrat, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Deuchert, E (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Disabil & Integrat, St Gallen, Switzerland.",eva.deuchert@unisg.ch; lukas.kauer@unisg.ch,"Deuchert, Eva/IXD-1412-2023","Kauer, Lukas/0000-0003-1754-6942",Ernst Gohner Foundation,Ernst Gohner Foundation,"The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Ernst Gohner Foundation and the excellent research assistance provided by Karina Schindler.

Will this mandate significantly affect the take-up of employer health insurance? This paper analyzes the Massachusetts Health Care and Insurance Reform Law of 2006 to gain some insight on the impact of employer mandates on coverage distributions. Results suggest that the large-firm employer mandate to offer health insurance was effective at reducing subsidized insurance crowd-out of employer-sponsored health insurance among workers who were income-eligible for subsidies. Using a triple-differences identification strategy and a synthetic control group approach, this paper finds that roughly half of those newly taking up employer-sponsored insurance in large firms subjected to the mandate would have enrolled in subsidized coverage had their employer been exempted from or subjected to a more lenient employer mandate.","[Lyons, Sean] Congress Budget Off, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Lyons, S (通讯作者)，Congress Budget Off, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",sean.lyons@cbo.gov,,,,,,,23,4,5,1,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

The Cluster Rule combines regulatory requirements from the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act that are based on plants altering their production processes away from chlorine-based bleaching agents. In addition to, or instead of, altering production processes, plants may plausibly comply with the regulation by reducing output of bleached products or dropping some of these products entirely. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach, we find evidence that plants facing both air and water Cluster Rule regulation (treatment group) are more likely to drop bleached products relative to unbleached products compared to plants facing only air Cluster Rule regulation (control group). Furthermore, we find evidence that plants in the control group alter their product mixes toward bleached products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, there is a wider context of increasing farm diversification, and a need for greater understanding of farmers' attitudes and behaviour related to afforestation. This paper uses a representative survey of Scottish farmers (survey year: 2013, respondents used in analysis: 1735) to compare farmers who intended to expand forestry in future and farmers with alternative combinations of intended and past behaviour in relation to forestry. Overall, we find that certain characteristics: already operating forestry, reporting types of non-farming activities, involvement in environmental schemes, having a high education level, having a relatively high number of employees, and being relatively recent entrants to holdings, were more frequently found among farmers intending to increase forestry in future than farmers described as 'non-increasers' who did not intend to increase forestry and also had not expanded it in the past. Farmers with these characteristics could be a useful focus in attempts to expand woodland at larger scales, and encouraging small-scale tree planting could be an effective policy approach.

Participants (n = 2279) over 40 years old, sampled from the greater area of Athens using a multistage stratified quota sampling method, completed both EQ-5D versions, while information was also collected on socio-demographics and health-related characteristics. The EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-3L were evaluated in terms of agreement, ceiling effects, redistribution and inconsistency, informativity, and convergent and known-groups validity. The agreement between the EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L was high (ICC = 0.85). Ceiling effects decreased significantly in the EQ-5D-5L in all domains (P < 0.001), with usual activities (-21.4 %) and self-care (-20.1 %) showing the highest absolute and anxiety/depression the highest relative reduction (-32.46 %). Inconsistency was low (5.7 %). The increase in prevalence of problems was larger than the decrease in their severity, resulting in a lower mean health utility for the EQ-5D-5L. Overall absolute and relative informativity improved by 70.5 % and 16.4 %, respectively, in the EQ-5D-5L. Both instruments exhibited good convergent and known-groups validity, with evidence of a considerably better convergent performance and discriminatory ability of the EQ-5D-5L. Both EQ-5D versions demonstrated good construct validity and had consistent redistribution. The EQ-5D-5L system may be preferable to the EQ-5D-3L, as it exhibited superior performance in terms of lower ceiling effects, higher absolute and relative informativity, and improved convergent and known-groups validity efficiency.","[Yfantopoulos, John N.; Chantzaras, Athanasios E.] Univ Athens, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, 6 Themistokleous St, Athens 10678, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Yfantopoulos, JN (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, 6 Themistokleous St, Athens 10678, Greece.",yfantopoulos@gmail.com,"Yfantopoulos, John/ABA-7730-2020; Chantzaras, Athanasios/N-4778-2019","Chantzaras, Athanasios/0000-0001-6740-8420",,,,,54,45,48,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The DSU provides limited guidelines on the RPT, stating only that it should not normally exceed 15 months. In practice, Arbitrators have developed the standard that the RPT should reflect the shortest possible period under the domestic legal system of the defending Member to make the changes necessary to comply with the WTO rulings. Our research confirms that in practice Arbitrators have determined this period by splitting the difference' approximately between the periods suggested by the complaining and defending Member.

Using the German Socio-Economic Panel for the years 1984 to 2009 and macroeconomic variables for 24 countries of origin, we exploit country year variation for identification of the effect and panel data to control for migrants' observed and unobserved characteristics. We find strong evidence that migrants' well-being responds negatively to an increase in the GDP of their home country. That is, migrants seem to regard home countries as natural comparators, which grounds the idea of relative deprivation underlying the decision to migrate.

Wind turbines, however, are not free of externalities themselves, particularly interference with landscape aesthetics. We quantify these negative externalities using the life satisfaction approach. To this end, we combine household data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) with a novel panel dataset on over 20,000 installations. Based on geographical coordinates and construction dates, we establish causality in a difference-indifferences design. Matching techniques drawing on exogenous weather data and geographical locations of residence ensure common trend behaviour. We show that the construction of wind turbines close to households exerts significant negative external effects on residential well-being, although they seem both spatially and temporally limited, being restricted to about 4000 m around households and decaying after five years at the latest. Robustness checks, including view shed analyses based on digital terrain models and placebo regressions, confirm our results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper considers potential modifications of the HHS risk adjustment methodology to maintain plan protection against risk from high-cost cases within the current regulatory framework. We show analytically that modifications of the transfer formula and of the risk adjustment model itself are mathematically equivalent to a conventional actuarially fair reinsurance policy. Furthermore, closely related modifications of the transfer formula or the risk adjustment model can improve on conventional reinsurance by figuring transfers or estimating risk adjustment model weights recognizing the presence of a reinsurance function. In the empirical section, we estimate risk adjustment models with an updated and selected version of the data used to calibrate the federal payment models, and show, using simulation methods, that proposed modifications improve fit at the person level and protect small insurers against high-cost risk better than conventional reinsurance. We simulate various attachment points for the reinsurance equivalent policies and quantify the trade-offs of higher and lower attachment points.","[Layton, Timothy J.; McGuire, Thomas G.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Layton, TJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",Layton@hcp.med.harvard.edu,,,NIMH [R01-MH094290]; Laura and John Arnold Foundation,NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Laura and John Arnold Foundation,This research was supported by NIMH R01-MH094290 and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.,,31,5,5,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

This study is the first to test the equality between wage and marginal productivity losses due to absenteeism separately for team workers and non-team workers. Our estimates are based on linked employer-employee data from Canada. Results indicate that team workers are more productive and earn higher wages than non-team workers. However, the productivity gap between these two groups is considerably larger than the wage gap. In small firms, employee absenteeism results in lower productivity and wages, and the marginal productivity loss due to team worker absenteeism is significantly higher than the wage loss. No similar wage-productivity gap exists for large firms. Our findings suggest that productivity loss or gain is most likely to be underestimated when valued according to wages for team workers. The findings help to value the burden of illness-related absenteeism. This is important for economic evaluations that seek to measure the productivity gain or loss of a health care technology or intervention, which in turn can impact policy makers' funding decisions.","[Zhang, Wei; Sun, Huiying; Anis, Aslam H.] St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, 588-1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Zhang, Wei; Anis, Aslam H.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, 2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Woodcock, Simon] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",St. Paul's Hospital; University of British Columbia; Simon Fraser University,"Anis, AH (通讯作者)，St Pauls Hosp, Ctr Hlth Evaluat & Outcome Sci, 588-1081 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.;Anis, AH (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sch Populat & Publ Hlth, 2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",aslam.anis@ubc.ca,"Zhang, Wei/P-3692-2016","Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-7988-1979; Woodcock, Simon/0000-0002-6157-1646",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [231571]; CIHR Doctoral Research Award in the Area of Public Health Research; Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR Doctoral Research Award in the Area of Public Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research(Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research),This study was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) operating grant (#231571).

Recipients of living donor kidney transplantation (N = 46) were randomly allocated to either (1) standard aftercare or (2) standard aftercare plus additional telemedically supported case management. A range of cost figures of each patient's medical service utilization were calculated at month 3, 6 and 12 and analyzed using two-part regression models. In comparison to standard aftercare, patients receiving telemedically supported case management are associated with substantial lower costs related to unscheduled hospitalizations (mean difference: (sic)3,417.46 per patient for the entire one-year period, p = 0.003). Taking all cost figures into account, patients receiving standard aftercare are associated, on average, with one-year medical service utilization costs of (sic)10,449.28, while patients receiving telemedically supported case management are associated with (sic)5,504.21 of costs (mean difference: (sic)4,945.07 per patient, p < 0.001). With estimated expenditures of (sic)3,001.5 for telemedically supported case management of a single patient, we determined a mean difference of (sic)1,943.57, but this result is not statistically significant (p = 0.128). Sensitivity analyses show that the program becomes cost-neutral at around ten participating patients, and was beneficial starting at 15 patients. Routine implementation of telemedically supported case management in German medium and high-volume transplant centers would result in annual cost savings of (sic)791,033 for the German healthcare system. Patients with telemedically supported case management showed a lower utilization of medical services as well as better medical outcomes. Therefore, such programs should be implemented in medium and high-volume transplant centers.","[Kaier, Klaus; Hehn, Philip; Hauschke, Dieter; Bogatyreva, Lioudmila] Univ Freiburg, Fac Med, Inst Med Biometry & Stat, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Kaier, Klaus; Hehn, Philip; Hauschke, Dieter; Bogatyreva, Lioudmila] Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Hils, Silvia; Schmid, Anja; Jaenigen, Bernd; Pisarski, Przemyslaw] Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Fac Med, Transplantat Ctr,Dept Gen & Visceral Surg, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Fetzer, Stefan] Aalen Univ, Fac Econ, Beethovenstr 1, D-73430 Aalen, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Hochschule Aalen,"Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Fac Med, Inst Med Biometry & Stat, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.;Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",Kaier@imbi.uni-freiburg.de,"Kaier, Klaus/B-4227-2009","Kaier, Klaus/0000-0003-0837-6945",European Union [A 12 - Promethee]; Novartis,European Union(European Union (EU)); Novartis(Novartis),"The project was funded by the European Union within the INTERREG IV Program (grant reference number A 12 - Promethee).

Economic development must deal with the economic, social, political and institutional mechanisms, both public and private, necessary to bring about rapid and large scale improvement in the standard of living for the masses of povertystricken, malnourished and illiterate people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. One of the main drivers for economic development that has become apparent over recent years is technology. Technology is not something that just happens to economies, it is a process that countries need to consciously and actively promote and nurture. It is now widely accepted that information and communications technologies (ICT) and e-commerce are at the centre of an economic and social transformation that is affecting all countries. The Third World has a well-recognised e-commerce and marketing potential. A significant proportion of the Third World is already partially developed and a significant proportion of the population has a demographic profile similar to that of the developed economies. It is generally believed that e-commerce enables developing country producers to overcome traditional limitations associated with restricted access to information, high market-entry costs, and isolation from potential markets. The majority of developing countries face limitations on the development of their electronic economy (e-economy) stemming largely from low income levels, low literacy rates, lack of payment systems that can support online transactions, and cultural resistance to online trade. Developing countries need to take into consideration that building telecommunications infrastructure is costly. In many cases, countries will need inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to improve domestic infrastructure. The revolution of e-commerce presents micro-and macroeconomic challenges, not only for organisations, but also for governments.","[Almadani, Alseddig] John Naisbitt Univ, Goce Delceva 8A, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",,"Almadani, A (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Goce Delceva 8A, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",Almadani_2022@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,437,443,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000045,0

Financial derivatives, which are not only highly representative of the underlying indices but can also be traded on both the spot and futures markets, include Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which is a tradable spot index whose aim is to replicate the return of an underlying benchmark index. When ETF futures are not available to examine spillover effects, generated regressors may be used to construct both Financial ETF futures and Energy ETF futures. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the co-volatility spillovers within and across the US energy and financial sectors in both spot and futures markets, by using generated regressors and a multivariate conditional volatility model, namely Diagonal BEKK. The daily data used are from 1998/12/23 to 2016/4/22. The data set is analyzed in its entirety, and also subdivided into three subset time periods. The empirical results show there is a significant relationship between the Financial ETF and Energy ETF in the spot and futures markets. Therefore, financial and energy ETFs are suitable for constructing a financial portfolio from an optimal risk management perspective, and also for dynamic hedging purposes.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Wang, Chien-Hsun] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; National Tsing Hua University; National Tsing Hua University,"McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X; McAleer, Michael/0000-0003-2707-3835","National Science Council, Taiwan; Australian Research Council; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors are grateful to Wen-Ping Hsieh and Leh-Chyan So for helpful comments and suggestions.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2013, p. 3) noted that: a number of weaknesses have been identified with using VaR for determining regulatory capital requirements, including its inability to capture tail risk. The proposed reform costs and impact on bank balances may be substantial, such that the size and distribution of daily capital charges under the new rules could be affected significantly. Regulators and bank risk managers agree that all else being equal, a better distribution of daily capital charges is to be preferred. The distribution of daily capital charges depends generally on two sets of factors: (1) the risk function that is adopted (ES versus VaR); and (2) their estimated counterparts. The latter is dependent on what models are used by bank risk managers to provide for forecasts of daily capital charges. That is to say, while ES is known to be a preferable risk function based on its fundamental properties and greater accounting for the tails of alternative distributions, that same sensitivity to tails can lead to greater daily capital charges, which is the relevant (that is, controlling) practical reference for risk management decisions and observations. In view of the generally agreed focus in this field on the tails of non-standard distributions and low probability outcomes, an assessment of relative merits of estimated ES and estimated VaR is ideally not limited to mean variance considerations. For this reason, robust comparisons between ES and VaR will be achieved in the paper by using a Stochastic Dominance (SD) approach to rank ES and VaR.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Jimenez-Martin, Juan-Angel; Perez-Amaral, Teodosio] Univ Madrid, Inst Econ Anal Complutense ICAE, Dept Quantitat Econ & Complutense, Madrid, Spain; [Maasoumi, Esfandiar] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; Emory University; National Tsing Hua University; University of Canterbury,"McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/H-7230-2015","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X; MARTIN, JUAN ANGEL JIMENEZ/0000-0001-5608-3288",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Spain [ECO2012-31941],Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Spain(Spanish Government),"The first author wishes to thank the National Science Council, Taiwan, the second and fifth authors acknowledge the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Spain through the research project ECO2012-31941 and Comunidad de Madrid, and the fourth author is grateful to the National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan and the Australian Research Council.

It is an outcome of economic growth which is treated as a means to reach higher standard of living. However, it creates negative effects on growth (the solution). Growth increases the proportion of the old-age population which contributes to the increase in public spending on health which results in the expansion of the public sector. In the analysis of the population ageing, there are some important aspects that one needs to be familiar with. This paper examines and highlights some of such striking features of the population ageing by reviewing literature and examining relationships between variables in the light of secondary data. To avoid the expansion of the public sector, the paper proposes imposing a payment on children so that their old-age parents could lead better lives. Also, the paper recognizes the population ageing as a cost of growth and emphasizes the analytical tools to be used for countries where direct approach to welfare is adopted. Finally the study highlights a greater volatility in economic growth than in life expectancy as another issue and lower levels of labour force in developing Asian countries than in developed economies in the region which may create rigorous problems for these developing nations once their income increases in the future.","[Herath, Tikiri Nimal] Univ Sri Jayawardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka",University Sri Jayewardenepura,"Herath, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Sri Jayawardenepura, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka.",,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,0,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,131,140,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100011,0

It compares the educational attainment difference between immigrants and nonmigrants who remain in the home country and demonstrates that immigrants to the US are more educated than their home-country counterparts across all immigrant groups (positive selection). Regression results further indicate that higher gender inequality in the home country influences more highly educated women to migrate.

The parameter stability test shows instability in the short run and the result is inappropriate for estimation due to the presence of structural changes. The Sub-sample rolling window test is used to address the time-varying, and it provides bi-directional causality at different sub-sample. The finding does not support the neoclassical profit-maximizing model, which states that PPI is not a single factor of fluctuation in CPI for Romania. It indicates the bidirectional relationship between the PPI and CPI, suggests that both these price indices play a significant role.

As a main consequence of market frictions, financing constraints have sizeable impacts on how CFOs behave and design their financial policies. We use a sample of firms from the six GCC countries and specify a range of investment equations to explore the behavior of cash flow sensitivities to fixed investment, working capital, and R&D. Our results show that GCC firms seem to have less costly financing sources when financing their inventories and/or holding cash than investing in fixed assets and R&D. Our results indicate that there is heterogeneity of the impact of financing conditions on the behavior of GCC firms. The Omani and Bahraini firms seem to be more oriented toward building their working capital during periods of financial distress in order to finance their fixed and R&D investments. This behavior does not seem to be consistent with the other countries. Indeed, we find sheer evidence that the Saudi, Qatari, Kuwaiti, and Emirati firms do not opt for an alleviation of financing constraints by smoothing the cash flow fluctuations with changes in working capital.","[Mansour, Walid] King Abdulaziz Univ, Islamic Econ Dept, POB 80214, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Mansour, Walid; Saci, Karima; Khalifa, Saida] Dar Al Hekma Univ, Banking & Finance Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Mansour, Walid] Univ Carthage, ECSTRA Res Lab, IHEC, Tunis, Tunisia; [Mansour, Walid] Univ Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia",King Abdulaziz University; Dar Al Hekma University; Universite de Carthage; Universite de Sousse,"Mansour, W (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Islamic Econ Dept, POB 80214, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",walid.mansour@fulbrightmail.org,,,Dar Al-Hekma University,Dar Al-Hekma University,"The authors would like to thank Dar Al-Hekma University for sponsoring this research.

Other qualities which achieved a high response rate (over 1/4 of participants) included: responsibility, emotional intelligence, self-discipline as well as diligence and reliability. As part of the discussion the obtained results were compared to models of effective managers presented by other authors.","[Moczydlowska, Joanna M.] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Moczydlowska, JM (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",joanna@moczydlowska.pl,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education for learning,Ministry of Science and Higher Education for learning,The research has been realised within the confines of paper no.

With the help of survey among the managers of enterprises that work in the sphere of forestry, evaluation of risk and income during creation and exploitation of forest plantations was performed. It was established that the age of cutting (or turnover) of forest plantations, together with assortment and agricultural technique of growing, influences significantly the entrepreneurial revenues and risks. Forest plantations with minimal turnover of cutting are the most risky and unprofitable. A criterion of entrepreneurial certainty in effectiveness of creation of forest plantations is combination of acceptable level of revenues with acceptable risk. It is proved that significant factors for development of entrepreneurship in this sphere are measures for support and tax subsidies. A large part of entrepreneurs that work in the forestry sphere of the central part of Russia are not sure in effectiveness of plantation forestry, as these activities are related to risk and uncertainty in receipt of the final result, due to long time intervals of growing plantation trees. The economically expedient plantation forestry is based on combination of two conditions-turnover of cutting for the criterion of maximum of receipt of the targeted assortments and price for assortments that is sufficient for compensation of production costs which appear in the process of cutting. A large contribution into reduction of the turnover of cutting and, as a consequence, reduction of production costs could be done by biotechnologies. It is determined that with the use of biotechnologies, the cost of creation of forest plantations grow significantly. That's why entrepreneurial structures are not interested in creation of plantations. This task could be solved in the sphere of development and establishment of the State program of support for development of agricultural forestry and plantation forest breeding. The program should envisage economic mechanisms of stimulation of development of plantation forest breeding.","[Morkovina, S. S.; Sibiryatkina, I. V.; Ivanova, A.

Developed economies such as the European Union (EU) have adopted measures to lower chemical content in food products, and there is a growing demand for organic food in such markets. Since the EU is one of the key markets for Indian agriculture exports, Indian exporters have to adhere to the EU's food safety requirements and consumer needs. A number of them have started exporting organic food products to the EU. The organic food market in developing countries such as India is also growing and a number of EU companies are also keen to export to such markets. Given this background, this paper examines the possibility of enhancing India-EU trade in organic food products. Since bilateral trade data is not available for organic food products, the paper is based on indepth interviews with 55 companies (40 in India and 15 in the EU) which are engaged in organic food product trade. The paper found that the EU is a key market for a majority of Indian exporters, especially in product categories such as tea and rice, and there is enormous export potential. However, in order to further develop EU-India trade relations in organic, certain trade barriers have to be addressed and policy initiatives have to be taken by the Indian government on its own as well as by working together with EU stakeholders.","[Mukherjee, Arpita; Kapoor, Avantika; Goyal, Tanu M.] Indian Council Res Int Econ Relat, New Delhi, India",,"Mukherjee, A (通讯作者)，Indian Council Res Int Econ Relat, New Delhi, India.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,"MASTERS INT CONSULTANCY RES PUBL, MIRDEC",KUCUKCEKMECE,"CINARLICESME SK, NO 21-13, KUCUKCEKMECE, ISTANBUL PK-34303, TURKEY",,,978-605-82290-3-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,27,42,,,,,,16,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ5TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426276100003,0

It has taken root in China, Southeast Asia, most of Latin America, Eastern Europe and even the former Soviet Union. There are many things that the markets do extraordinarily well. Countries with long experience of the capitalist system - Western Europe and North America - have great wealth They are also the melting pot of remarkable technological innovations, scientific discoveries, and educational and social progress. The emergence of modern capitalism three hundred years ago made possible material progress of unprecedented magnitude. Today, however, almost a generation after the fall of the Soviet Union, a form of disappointment seems to be taking hold. Capitalism is certainly prosperous. Economic activity continues to grow, world trade is exploding, multinational enterprises are spreading in the developing world as in the former Soviet bloc, technological advances are multiplying. But not everyone benefits. The distribution of world income confirms this: 94% of the world's income comes to 40% of the population, while the remaining 60% must live with only 6% of world income. Half of humanity lives on $2 a day or less; Nearly one billion people live on less than $1 a day. Poverty is not uniformly distributed on the surface of the globe: some regions suffer from its worst effects. In sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America, hundreds of millions of poor struggles to survive. Periodic disasters, such as the tsunami which devastated the regions around the Indian Ocean in 2004, continue to kill hundreds of thousands of poor and vulnerable people. The gap between the North and the South, between the richest and the rest, has widened. Some countries have, however, paid a high price for their economic success over the past three decades. Since China embarked on economic reforms in the late 1970s, it has grown rapidly; According to the World Bank, more than 400 million Chinese people have emerged from poverty. As a result, India has become the nation with the largest poor population, even though China has a larger global population.","[Nechad, Abdelhamid; Housni, Hamid] Univ Abdelmalek Essaadi, Tetouan, Morocco",Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan,"Nechad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Abdelmalek Essaadi, Tetouan, Morocco.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,632,640,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000068,0

However, a deeper analysis leads to the other variables, such as life expectancy, education, health care, the use of modern technology and etc. which are in direct correlation with the development of a country. Considering, this fact, it is clear that the creation of new economic models for sustainable development must include the human aspects, which have been largely neglected, so far in economic theory. Past models were based primarily on the use of the basic factors of production. As the example of this is Switzerland, the first ranking country in the Global Competitiveness Index for the last eight years. But also the same ranking country in the efficiency of the work force, innovation and readiness in accepting the new technologies. Switzerland is fourth ranking in index of education and eight of the health care index. These indicators show us precisely the importance of human capital in creating a new framework for economic development. The new model of economic growth and development must include the four aspects, namely: human capital, innovation and technology, capital investment and natural resources. An important role in the formation of such a model of sustainable economic growth and development must have the government, as the main strategist in defining desirable priorities.","[Radicevic, Tatjana Dragicevic; Stanojevic, Ljiljana] Fac Geoecon, Belgrade, Serbia; [Nestorovic, Milica] Fac BusinessStudies, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Radicevic, TD (通讯作者)，Fac Geoecon, Belgrade, Serbia.",tdragicevic@naisbitt.edu.rs; mnestorovic@naisbitt.edu.rs; ljstanojevic@naisbitt.edu.rs,"Stanojevic, Ljiljana/M-8491-2019; García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021; Radičević, Tatjana Dragičević/ABH-5610-2020","Stanojevic, Ljiljana/0000-0002-4157-4989; Radičević, Tatjana Dragičević/0000-0002-5995-7347",,,,,9,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,149,158,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000016,0

The results of research show that marketing students value the most the combination of theoretical and practical knowledge, intelligence and imagination, interactivity with their academics, and the use of contemporary examples from practice on classes and in textbooks. The holistic approach to marketing knowledge leads towards the differentiating marketing actors as a genius as a combination of Einstein and Picasso. Genius marketers understand the significance of the interactions of all marketing actors (academics, students and practitioners) in the process of the co-creation of marketing knowledge, observe marketing as a science and an art, give equal significance to the marketing theory and practice, intelligence and imagination.

Poor infrastructure and discriminatory policies, combined with Israel's rapid economic privatization, set contradictory expectations for Palestinian-Israeli women: their opportunity-cost calculations include entitlements to economic protection alongside obligations to provide expenditure-saving domestic labor. Yet growing pressure and desire to join the paid workforce suggest that the gender contract may be changing. This cultural schema, which links women's economic strategizing to their sense of feminine propriety, is transforming as part of a broader transition to a market-led gender regime, with the paradoxical effect of encouraging women's employment while simultaneously impoverishing them. By dwelling on the dialectics of culture and the structure of work opportunities, and women's agency, this paper aims to resolves an impasse in the current debate on women's low workforce participation.","[Sa'ar, Amalia] Univ Haifa, Dept Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Sa'ar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",saaramalia@gmail.com,,,Israel Science Foundation [1094/08],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"Research was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Israel Science Foundation, research grant No. 1094/08, and a philanthropic fund that wishes to remain anonymous.

Using provincial-level data over the 2003-2011 period and employing a spatial Durbin model (SDM), the empirical results reveal strong spillover effects in both the input and output processes of regional innovation.

By contrast, externalities from absorptive capacity are spatially localized, and foreign direct investment (FDI) can lead to negative spillover effects in this context.

Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is to identify the level of cooperation of business with business environment institutions in chosen business sectors in Poland and Belarus and the possibilities of strengthening this cooperation in the near future. The research problem was answered through posing the following questions: which factors affect the level of cooperation with business environment institutions? How do respondents rate the current level of cooperation with business environment institutions? To what degree do individual factors affect the current level of cooperation of businesses with business environment institutions? What is the level of interest of the researched firms in strengthening cooperation with business environment institutions? To what extent could positive changes in individual factors lead to an improvement in the cooperation of businesses with business environment institutions in the near future? Data and Methods: The research encompassed over 500 businesses. The data was interpreted with the use of tables, descriptive statistics and nonparametric statistics. Results and conclusions: The research carried out indicated both a low level of current cooperation of businesses with business environment institutions (a mean average of 3.07 (on a scale of 1-7)) and an average level of interest in strengthening this in the future (3.69).","[Tomaszuk, Anna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Tomaszuk, A (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",a.tomaszuk@pb.edu.pl,,"Tomaszuk, Anna/0000-0002-2675-0323",,,,,40,2,2,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,232,243,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700024,0

Comparative characteristics are performed. Audit is viewed from the point of view of criteria as an independent competent study of an economic subject. Information base is studied from the point of view of organizational & legal, tax, financial & analytical, and reserve regulation according to the set criteria and standards. During the research, the authors used the international standards of audit of the ISO series, defining audit as a documented process of obtaining the proofs of audit and their objective evaluation for the purpose of establishment of the level of execution of coordinated criteria of audit. It is established that audit is an independent verification of authenticity of financial accounting and economic subject accounting, performed by external auditor and internal competent employee on the basis of observation of existing provisions and standards. Besides, a reason for negative phenomena in organizations is inadequate system of management, which characterizes instability and uncertainty of managerial decisions. Thus, quality of development and organization of management process determines the work of the organization on the whole and its structural departments in particular. Based on this, the authors set limits and peculiarities of management quality. One of the forms of management control is internal audit. The sense of audit of organization's management control is defined as a process of study and evaluation of authenticity of data of financial accounting and other financial information that characterizes financial and economic activities of organization. It is emphasized that goals of revision, internal and external general audit, internal and external audit of management quality are determined by organization's management. However, during conduct of external general audit, the tasks are determined not only by organization's management but by the law as well (in case of mandatory audit). Besides, during revision, performed by revision commissions formed by the above organization, the goals are determined not by the management of inspected organization but by the above organization.","[Volkova, M.

This study analyzes how the spatial and sectoral patterns of employment growth have changed between 2000 and 2010 by estimating aggregate and sectoral employment growth equations using county-level employment data. The results support significant beta convergence effects in all sectors in which employment growth is negatively correlated with their initial sectoral shares. Also, preferential policies targeting the western China have successfully stimulated faster sectoral employment growth. However, there are considerable sectoral heterogeneities when examining the effects of policies targeting the central and northeastern China. The results also reveal nonlinear effects of labor pooling economies proxied by initial total employment on sectoral employment growth for the majority sectors. A few other stylized facts are also in line with the expectation.","[Wang, Xuejun; Tian, Xi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Tian, X (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tian@njau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403126, 71403128]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Nanjing Agricultural University [SKCX2016001]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Nanjing Agricultural University; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71403126, 71403128]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Nanjing Agricultural University [grant number SKCX2016001]; Project of Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,39,1,1,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

An analysis of the Polish labor market also shows differences in the way women and men are treated. It is confirmed by several coefficients which have remained unchanged for years: a lower coefficient of professional activity of women, a lower coefficient in hiring women, a higher level of unemployment among women, inequality in regards to remuneration and weak presence of women in regards to positions within upper management and on boards of directors of companies. Sex is still an important factor in determining the place and position of current and potential labor market participants. Despite the progressing process of feminization the problem of the professional life of women is still noticeable.

The cost of bonds is more likely to decrease when the syndicate has more membersspecifically, more joint managers. Additionally, by measuring the information asymmetry using several methods, we observe that this negative relationship is more pronounced when the information asymmetry between issuers and bond investors is more serious.

This paper shows for the first time that unemployment not only affects enrollment but also changes the composition of the student body and students' educational path, with important consequences for intergenerational mobility. Results show that unemployment stimulates university enrollment especially among individuals with highly educated parents. This has consequences for educational inequality. Students are also more likely to choose university over community college when unemployment rises. Thus, labor market conditions affect the type of education and skills that students acquire. Further, unemployment is shown to affect the decision of workers to return to school and complete their unfinished studies or acquire additional training.","[Alessandrini, Diana] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Antigonish, NS, Canada",Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada,"Alessandrini, D (通讯作者)，St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Antigonish, NS, Canada.",dalessan@stfx.ca,"Alessandrini, Diana/GXH-3816-2022",,,,,,33,12,13,0,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

However, it is less clear why, historically, loose credit arrangements were so widespread. Somewhat misleadingly, much conjecture has laid blame at the feet of financial institutions themselves. While it is true that duplicitous and even corrupt lending practices were consequential antecedents of the crisis, a legacy commitment to certain - laudable - elements of New-Dealism created context for these elements to become established. To understand really what went wrong, it is necessary to look back before the 2000s and appreciate the interaction that was occurring between a long-term policy commitment to neoliberalism and piecemeal/fragmented application of approaches that aimed to assist financially disadvantaged people.

This paper addresses institutional arrangements between subjects who can provide a public good (insiders) and subjects who also benefit from the public good but cannot provide it (outsiders) due to technical, physical or institutional reasons. Using laboratory experiments, we compare a setting of passive outsiders to situations where outsiders can either make unconditional or conditional transfers to the group of insiders, in environments where transfers are shared equally among insiders. The primary behavioral questions are to what extent outsiders will use the opportunity to subsidize the contributions of insiders and how insiders will respond to those subsidies. In summary, outsiders make transfers to insiders, but reciprocal increases in contributions by insiders to transfers are small. Both transfers and contributions decay over time. Indeed, contributions to the public good with transfer institutions are no greater than those without such institutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Their coexistence, however, rather than producing larger output inefficiencies, can move optimal output closer to the first best when negative conservation externalities are minor.

Further, it has been shown that households' receiving food stamps fail to smooth consumption over the benefit month and experience periods of meaningful nutritional deficiencies. This paper exploits detailed administrative data on standardized math tests scores and randomized food stamp receipt dates to allow us to measure the impact of these low nutritional periods on student performance. Our main results demonstrate that scores are notably lower when the exam falls near the end of the benefit cycle and when food stamps arrive on the 4 days immediately preceding the exam. While both male and female students experienced a similar penalty with receipt near the end of the cycle, the effect from receipt just prior to the exam appears to be partially explained by a large negative effect associated with weekend receipt, which coincides with the 4 days prior to the exam. Our results provide evidence that households do not sufficiently smooth consumption and that this has measurable effects on student performance.","[Cotti, Chad] Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Gordanier, John; Ozturk, Orgul] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Cotti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",cottic@uwosh.edu; jgordartier@moore.sc.edu; odorturk@moore.sc.edu,"Ozturk, Orgul/ACY-8203-2022",,,,,,32,13,26,1,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

However, insufficient attention has been paid to how such measures might affect geoengineering in terms of the incentive structures which underwrite scientific progress. There is a tension between the features that make science productive, and the need to govern geoengineering research, which has thus far gone underappreciated. I emphasize how geoengineering research requires governance which reaches beyond science's traditional boundaries, and moreover requires knowledge which itself reaches beyond what we traditionally expect scientists to know about. How we govern emerging technologies should be sensitive to the incentive structures which drive science.","[Currie, Adrian] Ctr Study Existential Risk, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QY, England",,"Currie, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Study Existential Risk, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QY, England.",Ac2075@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,6,6,4,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,78,88,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.02.002,0.0,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900008,0

Poachers use chainsaws to remove and they sell them at local burl shops. Consequently, targeted trees are left susceptible to disease and can die. Given the limited resources RNSP have at their disposal, the study reports an empirically driven resource allocation strategy. The study first explores the spatial distribution of poaching incidents and other potentially important drivers of poaching in RNSP before employing an econometric approach informed by crime pattern theory to better understand how features of the natural and built environment within RNSP explain burl poaching. An exact logistic model suggests areas that include a greater number of targets (i.e. redwood burls) that are accessible to roads, as well as areas that are near to a greater number of burl shops are at an increased risk of burl poaching. The odds-ratios for each respective variable in the model are utilized to highlight those areas at greatest risk, and in turn to provide practical guidance for more spatially focused ranger patrols and interventions. A comprehensive intervention strategy that works on multiple levels to reduce opportunities for burl poaching in RNSP is discussed.","[Kurland, Justin] Univ Waikato, New Zealand Inst Secur & Crime Sci, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Pires, Stephen F.] Florida Int Univ, Steven J Green Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Dept Criminal Justice, 11200 SW 8th St,PCA 368A, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Marteache, Nerea] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Criminal Justice, 5500 Univ Pkwy, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA",University of Waikato; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; California State University System; California State University San Bernardino,"Pires, SF (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Steven J Green Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Dept Criminal Justice, 11200 SW 8th St,PCA 368A, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",sfpires@fiu.edu,,"Marteache, Nerea/0000-0003-4534-5320; Pires, Stephen/0000-0002-8525-0185",California State University San Bernadino,California State University San Bernadino,This research was made possible through an internal seed grant provided by California State University San Bernadino.,,72,18,21,0,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,SEP,2018,94.0,,,,,,46,54,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.06.009,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GP0VG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440528900007,0

Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) aim to address this problem of asymmetric information. In this paper, I exploit cross-state variation in PDMP implementation dates to estimate the effect of PDMPs on drug quantities and deaths. I expand upon previous work by analyzing outcomes for prescription drugs within and outside the opioid class, by considering spillovers into the illegal drug market, and by relying on high-frequency administrative data spanning the years 2000-13. I also estimate the effect of two PDMP characteristics with the potential to narrow information asymmetries among providers: direct PDMP access and required PDMP use. I find that neither PDMP implementation nor direct PDMP access had a significant effect on outcomes. These findings hold across drug classes, drug markets, and specifications. I find evidence, however, suggesting that required PDMP use reduced prescription opioid and stimulant quantities by 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively. In turn, prescription opioid and benzodiazepine deaths decreased by 9 percent and 13 percent, respectively. I also find evidence, albeit weak, suggesting that illegal drug deaths increased.","[Meinhofer, Angelica] RTI Int, Behav Hlth Econ Program, Raleigh, NC 27616 USA",Research Triangle Institute,"Meinhofer, A (通讯作者)，RTI Int, Behav Hlth Econ Program, Raleigh, NC 27616 USA.",anm@med.cornell.edu,,"Meinhofer, Angelica/0000-0002-6597-6755",,,,,31,39,48,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

I describe at what point students send scores to colleges and which score sends ultimately become applications, resulting in three main points. First, score sends are not synonymous with applications-rather, only 62 percent of score sends in this sample turn into applications. Second, the conversion from score send to application is nonrandom as it relates to college characteristics: Score sends are more likely to convert into applications when they are to colleges with lower tuition, higher graduation rates, and relatively near a student's home. Third, the timing of score sends is related to the probability of its becoming an application, whereby score sends sent relatively early are least likely to become applications. These facts imply that there is room for improvement when modeling the application process and, in addition, the timing of an intervention or policy may be critical to its success.","[Smith, Jonathan] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Smith, J (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",jsmith500@gsu.edu,,,,,,,35,6,8,1,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

By demand effects, we mean anything in the survey that unintentionally influences respondents' beliefs about appropriate behavior, which in turn might affect their responses in the survey. We implement two methods for measuring and implicitly reducing the influence of demand effects. The first approach-random selection of good to be valued-does not have any effect on respondent behavior. The second approach-a demand script and a control question with feedback-has a sizable and statistically significant effect on respondent behavior. In particular, estimated marginal willingness to pay for improvements in water quality are substantially (around 50 percent) lower than a control treatment; we attribute this decrease to a reduced demand effect. Our results suggest that stated preference methods tend to lead to biased willingness-to-pay estimates due to demand effects, but that the bias can be reduced using simple measures.

We elicit risk preferences on a sample of 1500 French general practitioners (GPs) using two different classes of tools: scales, which measure GPs' own perception of their willingness to take risks between 0 and 10; and lotteries, which require GPs to choose between a safe and a risky option in a series of hypothetical situations. In addition to a daily life risk scale that measures a general risk attitude, risk taking is measured in different domains for each tool: financial matters, GPs' own health, and patients' health. We take advantage of the rare opportunity to combine these multiple risk attitude measures with a series of self-reported or administratively recorded medical practices. We successively test the predictive power of our seven risk attitude measures on eleven medical practices affecting the GPs' own health or their patients' health. We find that domain-specific measures are far better predictors than the general risk attitude measure. Neither of the two classes of tools (scales or lotteries) seems to perform indisputably better than the other, except when we concentrate on the only non-declarative practice (prescription of biological tests), for which the classic money-lottery test works well. From a public health perspective, appropriate measures of willingness to take risks may be used to make a quick, but efficient, profiling of GPs and target them with personalized communications, or interventions, aimed at improving practices.","[Massin, Sophie] Artois Univ, UMR 9221, LEM, UFR EGASS, 9 Rue Temple,BP 10665, F-62030 Arras, France; [Nebout, Antoine] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, ALISS UR1303, F-94205 Ivry, France; [Ventelou, Bruno] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Cent Marseille, CNRS,EHESS, Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno] Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, IRD, SESSTIM, Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno] Reg Hlth Observ Provence Alpes Cote Azur ORS PACA, Marseille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm),"Massin, S (通讯作者)，Artois Univ, UMR 9221, LEM, UFR EGASS, 9 Rue Temple,BP 10665, F-62030 Arras, France.",somassin@gmail.com,"Massin, Sophie/AAV-4609-2020","Massin, Sophie/0000-0002-4617-1089","Direction de la Recherche, des Etudes, de l'Evaluation et des Statistiques (DREES) - Ministere du travail, des relations sociales, de la famille, de la solidarite et de la ville, Ministere de la sante et des sports","Direction de la Recherche, des Etudes, de l'Evaluation et des Statistiques (DREES) - Ministere du travail, des relations sociales, de la famille, de la solidarite et de la ville, Ministere de la sante et des sports","We thank all GPs who participated in the survey as well as members of the supervisory committee of the French Panel of General Practices.

The model comprises three modules used to calculate: i) potential financial damage (temporary-or -permanenth--ii)-the-annual-probability-of-extreme-events-(fires-and-storms),-iii)-the-insurance premium for each site. Research focused on a multiscale approach able to provide outputs at a regional (NUTS-2) and national scale in Italy. Results reveal the high variability of forests in the case study area from the standpoint of both the value of woodlands and the probability of extreme meteorological events. In general, premiums seem to be consistent in the southern regions, in high forest and in Mediterranean forest typologies. The model can be used to analyse different scenarios and variables related to forest characteristics/management as well as financial options. Additional analysis can reveal where and how public subsidy of insurance premiums could favour the diffusion of this form of risk management.","[Sacchelli, Sandro; Cipollaro, Maria; Fabbrizzi, Sara] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forest Syst Management, GESAAF, 18 Ple Cascine, I-50144 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Sacchelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forest Syst Management, GESAAF, 18 Ple Cascine, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",sandro.sacchelli@unifi.it,,"SACCHELLI, SANDRO/0000-0002-7031-1125",,,,,46,11,13,0,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2018,92.0,,,,,,106,118,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.011,0.0,,,13,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GJ9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435750000011,0

This paper analyses trends of intensification and expansion at the national level, particularly in the oil palm sector in Indonesia and Malaysia. Despite similar starting points and also comparable rates of increasing productivity and profit in this sector, both countries have developed almost opposite trajectories of land use. While both intensification and expansion has occurred in these countries, national indicators show that Malaysia has largely pursued intensification while Indonesia has overwhelmingly favoured expansion. Using the framework of the Jevons paradox, this paper contributes to the existing literature by arguing how and why political and social factors, rather than technology and market incentives, can better account for the differences between yield and land use efficiency in Indonesia and Malaysia today. The paper argues that expansion in Malaysia has been curtailed by the Malaysian government's pledge to maintain at least 50% forest cover in the late 1990s, coupled with a government supported corporate strategy of establishing plantations in Indonesia. Indonesia has made no such pledge, leading to expansionist policies focused on market creation and production goals with limited incentives for technology-driven intensification. It also notes however that in recent years, new socio-political developments in both countries may yet change this clear dichotomy of opposing land use strategies between these two countries, namely Sarawak's recent autonomous tendencies over land use and Indonesia's new leadership and international No Deforestation Peat and Exploitation (NDPE) commitments.","[Varkkey, Helena] Social Sci Univ Malaya, Fac Arts, Dept Int & Strateg Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Tyson, Adam] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna] Univ Indonesia Depok, Dept Int Relat, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Nusantara 2 Bldg,2nd Floor, Jawa Barat 16424, Indonesia",Universiti Malaya; University of Leeds; University of Indonesia,"Varkkey, H (通讯作者)，Social Sci Univ Malaya, Fac Arts, Dept Int & Strateg Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",helenav@um.edu.my; A.D.Tyson@leeds.ac.uk; shofwan.albanna@ui.ac.id,"Varkkey, Helena/K-7934-2012; Varkkey, Helena/IZP-8781-2023; Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna/AAU-5918-2020","Varkkey, Helena/0000-0002-4622-0450; Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna/0000-0002-9736-9677; Tyson, Adam/0000-0002-4458-6870",British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme [PM160069]; British Academy,British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme; British Academy,"This work was supported by the British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme (Award Reference Grant Number: PM160069).

Using a regression discontinuity design and data from North Carolina, this study examines the of effects of this policy on teacher turnover and attrition. Subgroup-specific accountability had no overall effects on teacher turnover or attrition, but the policy caused black teachers who taught in schools that were held accountable for the black student subgroup to leave teaching at significantly lower rates, compared with black teachers who taught in schools not accountable for the black subgroup's performance. The policy also caused shifts in the students assigned to black teachers, with schools that were held accountable for the black subgroup less likely to assign black students to black teachers the following year. These findings demonstrate that subgroup-focused policies-particularly those that use cutoffs to determine subgroup accountability-can shape the composition of the teacher labor force in unintended ways, and have implications for the design of future accountability systems that aim to close racial/ethnic gaps in achievement.","[Shirrell, Matthew] George Washington Univ, Grad Sch Educ & Human Dev, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Shirrell, M (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Grad Sch Educ & Human Dev, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",mshirrell@gwu.edu,"Shirrell, Matthew/HJP-0635-2023","Shirrell, Matthew/0000-0002-7783-8579","Albert Shanker Institute; National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation; Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305B080027]","Albert Shanker Institute; National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation; Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education)","Work on this paper was primarily completed while the author was at Northwestern University.

Therefore, ensuring efficient service provision is essential for a sustainable health care system. This paper investigates the performance of regional health care services in six West European countries between 2005 and 2014. We apply a stochastic metafrontier model to capture the different conditions in the health care systems in the countries within the European Union. By means of this approach, it is possible to detect performance differences in the European health care systems subject to different conditions and technologies relative to the potential technology available. The results indicate that regional deprivation plays a key role for the efficiency of health care provision. Furthermore, a pooled model which assumes a similar technology for all countries cannot sufficiently account for differences between countries. Surprisingly, the Scandinavian regions lag behind other regions with respect to the metafrontier.","[Schley, Katharina] Univ Goettingen, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Schley, K (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",kschley@uni-goettingen.de,,"Schley, Katharina/0000-0002-0975-4154",German Research Foundation (DFG) via the research training group 1644 Scaling Problems in Statistics,German Research Foundation (DFG) via the research training group 1644 Scaling Problems in Statistics(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The research project was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) via the research training group 1644 Scaling Problems in Statistics.,,37,6,6,1,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Exploiting the staggered implementation of food-waste collection across Swedish municipalities, we use a difference-in-difference design to measure the causal effect of introducing such collection on another pro-environmental behavior, namely the sorting of packaging waste. Results suggest a positive spillover effect on packaging waste which corresponds to 5-10% of the population average and rises gradually over time, possibly due to slow implementation of food-waste collection in many municipalities. These estimates are unconfounded with a number of shifts in the waste-related incentives facing households, e.g. introduction of curbside collection of packaging waste from single-family homes. Although we are unable to directly account for all such factors, indirect robustness tests provide no compelling evidence that estimated spillovers are spurious. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike under long-term carbon sequestration commitments over a rotation period, landowners are allowed in this scheme to sell temporal carbon credits based on stored carbon for one year and reissue them annually. Using numeric optimization we show that the short-term carbon payment mechanism has a profound effect on the timing and intensity of thinning, and the optimal rotation length showing up in higher timber yield and improved profitability. A comparison of the case where all carbon or only additional carbon above that in timber management benchmark is accounted for by the short-term payment scheme shows that the optimal forest management remains roughly the same. However, the increase in the profitability of forestry introduced by carbon credits is relatively small, if only additional carbon is credited. Hence the short-term mechanism may be feasible only under high carbon prices and it would most likely increase rotation length of mature stands with additionality requirement in boreal forests.","[Juutinen, Artti; Ahtikoski, Anssi] Univ Oulu, Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Juutinen, Artti] Univ Oulu, Dept Econ, POB 4600, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Lehtonen, Mika] Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 18, FI-01371 Vantaa, Finland; [Makipaa, Raisa] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Oulu; University of Oulu; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Helsinki,"Juutinen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",artti.juutinen@luke.fi; anssi.ahtikoski@luke.fi; mika.lehtonen@luke.fi; raisa.makipaa@luke.fi; markku.ollikainen@helsinki.fi,"Mäkipää, Raisa/AAC-6548-2022","Mäkipää, Raisa/0000-0003-3146-4425; Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683; Ahtikoski, Anssi/0000-0003-1658-3813; Juutinen, Artti/0000-0003-4300-5365",,,,,53,28,32,5,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,115,127,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.02.005,0.0,,,13,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300014,0

Following Borghans and Schils (2012), we exploit exogenous variation in the ordering of questions asked by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to decompose student performance into two components: the starting performance and the decline in performance during the test. The latter component is interpreted as a measure of noncognitive skills. Students from different countries exhibit differences in performance at the start of the test and in their rates of deterioration in performance during the test. Both components have a positive and statistically significant association with economic growth, and the estimated effects are quite similar and robust.

A comparison of key design features suggests that future technology-based interventions should aim to provide proactive, personalized, and regular support.","[Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Petronijevic, Uros] York Univ, Econ, N York, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; York University - Canada,"Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，150 St George St,Suite 30, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca,,,Ontario Human Capital Research and Innovation Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant [435-2015-0180]; JPAL Pilot Grant; Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Ontario's Graduate Scholarship,Ontario Human Capital Research and Innovation Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); JPAL Pilot Grant; Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(CGIARSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ontario's Graduate Scholarship,"Philip Oreopoulos is a professor of economics at the University of Toronto.

The issue of China's increasing timber imports is now receiving extensive attention from the international community. Existing studies that analyze China's global timber sourcing focus on international trade data or rules at a predominantly macro-level, while few empirical studies exist. This paper takes a grounded approach to empirically study the timber trade from Myanmar to China via Yunnan Province. Using a global value chain analysis, the research identifies the flow of timber along the value chain, the different actors involved in the trade, and the institutions that shape the actor's access to the value chain, before calculating the profits among the different actors. The results show the Sino-Burmese border timber trade originated from traditional border trade and was recently booming along with the economic development of China. Along the timber value chain, however, a few privileged actors parasitize the timber value by exploiting real market participants with the power entitled to them by both governments. The research argues the challenges to improve sustainable timber trade lie not only in national law enforcement, but also improving the governance structure of the value chain by improving the transparency and accountability of timber harvesting concessions and trade permits.","[Dong, Min] Southwest Forestry Univ, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Dong, Min] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [He, Jun] Yunnan Univ, Natl Ctr Borderland Ethn Studies Southwest China, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [He, Jun] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ethnol & Sociol, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Southwest Forestry University - China; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Yunnan University; Yunnan University,"He, J (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ, Natl Ctr Borderland Ethn Studies Southwest China, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",jun.he@ynu.edu.cn,"He, Jun/A-5340-2019","He, Jun/0000-0002-1994-8075","Yunnan Provincial Foundation of Social Sciences [QN2013016]; Ministry of Education of China [16JJD850015]; Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University","Yunnan Provincial Foundation of Social Sciences; Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Program for Excellent Young Talents, Yunnan University","The fieldwork for this research was financed by the Yunnan Provincial Foundation of Social Sciences (Project no.

Of the 106 papers, most used three scenarios to assess changes in from two to four ecosystem services over the next 20 to 30 years. Overall, not all of the scenarios were used in a predictive capacity, and of the ecosystem services examined, regulating and provisioning services were analyzed more frequently than cultural services. In practice, when using the outcomes of this scenario approach, either an administrative unit or a basin approach is an advisable scale for decision making. As a basin includes various micro ecosystems and various stakeholders, a participatory approach is the most favored.","[Hasegawa, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Biodivers Ctr, Tenpaku Ku, 5-230 Motoyagoto, Nagoya, Aichi 4680066, Japan; Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan",Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan,"Hasegawa, Y (通讯作者)，Nagoya Biodivers Ctr, Tenpaku Ku, 5-230 Motoyagoto, Nagoya, Aichi 4680066, Japan.",lect.y.hasegawa@gmail.com,,,"Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-9, S-15]","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-9 and S-15) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",,47,7,8,0,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,FEB,2018,96.0,,,,,,23,31,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.11.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,FX4EB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426024400002,0

For the vast majority of WTO members the significance of mode 5 services is considerable, both in exports and imports. However unlike traditional GATS services trade, mode 5 services 'in boxes' pay tariffs. This article estimates that the global GDP gains from liberalizing mode 5 services at multilateral level could reach up to EUR 300 billion by 2025 and world trade could increase by over EUR 500 billion. The article also examines the interplay between mode 5 services trade and the growing importance of future technological developments (e.g. software, digitalization, the Internet of Things). Our preliminary set of results shows that a Mode 5 Services Initiative is important not only because of the positive impact it would have on global trade flows but also because it would facilitate trade-led technological progress in all regions of the world.","[Antimiani, Alessandro; Cernat, Lucian] European Commiss, DG TRADE, Brussels, Belgium",,"Cernat, L (通讯作者)，European Commiss, DG TRADE, Brussels, Belgium.",lucian.cernat@ec.europa.eu,,"antimiani, alessandro/0000-0002-7280-9373",,,,,23,7,9,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This double jeopardy of lower subsidies and greater offshoring restrictions must reduce domestic profits as well as domestic welfare. Finally, we show that there is no guarantee that such an offshoring quota will raise domestic employment in the oligopolistic sector, calling into question the efficacy of such a barrier.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Ghosh, Koushik] Cent Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Ellensburg, WA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Central Washington University,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",bandyopadhyay@stls.frb.org,"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543",,,,,12,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

I argue that the film is an early representative example of a public narrative based on behavioral economics. A popular movie informed by this discipline has a good deal of political potential for challenging injustices produced by neoliberal approaches to the financial services industry. However, I also argue that despite this political potential, The Big Short is unable to fundamentally challenge the belief in efficient markets that justify many of Wall Street's practices.

Women have been found less likely to respond correctly to financial test questions and more likely to select 'Don't know' option as compared to men in many national surveys, although causes of the phenomenon are still not fully explained. The main goal of this article is to check whether the gender differential exists among university students based on a new dataset derived from five European countries (self-administered survey, 1,022 respondents). To pursue this goal, we asked a series of questions: (1) Does the way in which financial literacy scores are determined matter for the gender gap measurement outcomes? (ii) Can the gap be explained by the presumably higher inclination of males to guess or greater tendency of males - as compared to females - to overestimate their capabilities? (iii) If the gender gap in financial literacy of university students exists, what factors can explain the gap? We used three-question single choice test to measure debt literacy - a little-studied aspect of financial literacy - and processed its results to obtain different markers of the literacy, allowing us to control for guessing and overconfidence effects. To gauge the possible gender gap in the literacy, we checked the statistical significance of differences in the test responses between female and male survey participants. We also ran a series of logistic regressions to rule out the possibility that gender differences found in the debt literacy test scores due to non-parametric tests were driven by factors other than gender. We confirm the gender differential in debt literacy among university students comprising our sample. We find that the observed gender gap cannot be explained by the combined effects of test guessing and overconfidence. Female business (including finance) students scored significantly better in a debt literacy test compared to their non-business female peers - an effect not present among male students. This could suggest that - unlike women who tend to increase their debt literacy through professional education - men may acquire the literacy differently and outside the formal education system.","[Cwynar, Andrzej; Cwynar, Wiktor] Univ Econ & Innovat, Projektowa 4, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland; [Szuba, Przemyslaw] Exacto Ltd, Siemienskiego 20-38, PL-35234 Rzeszow, Poland",,"Cwynar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Innovat, Projektowa 4, PL-20209 Lublin, Poland.",andrzej.cwynar@wsei.lublin.pl; wiktor.cwynar@wsei.lublin.pl; pszuba@exacto.pl,"Cwynar, Andrzej/AAD-5409-2019; Cwynar, Wiktor/AAA-9664-2020","Cwynar, Andrzej/0000-0003-2702-0397; Cwynar, Wiktor/0000-0001-6890-5189",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant [0057/DLG/2016/10],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",This work was supported by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education grant [contract no. 0057/DLG/2016/10 under the program 'Dialogue' (within a project entitled 'Debt Watch')].,,40,1,1,0,9,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,212,224,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200019,0

The article presents the results of assessing the level of development of the information and telecommunications sector of the Russian regions. Determining the level of information and telecommunications development in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation requires the development of analytical assessment indicators that reveal priority areas and constraints at the regional level. The following groups of factors are presented in the study: indicators of the level of human potential provision; indicators of the level of use of information and telecommunications technologies. The multidimensional data array was processed using the analytical platform Deductor Academic. The study was conducted on the basis of the construction of an aggregate indicator used to assess the regions of the Russian Federation in terms of the level of development of the information and telecommunications sector of the economy. The spread in the values of indicators for the main blocks is revealed, which generally determines the significant interregional differentiation. A complex of typological groups of regions was formed in accordance with the rating of the development level of the information and telecommunications sector. The practical significance of the results obtained is that they can be used to carry out transformations in the sphere of strategic territorial management in order to improve the performance of the information and telecommunications sector of the economy.

Married women in states with unilateral divorce spend less time on core housework than those in states without unilateral divorce, and married men contribute to a greater share of housework. This paper also uses cross-state and time variation in divorce law adoption by including additional data from the early 1990s to estimate the effect of a state's adoption of unilateral divorce on daily time use. The analysis confirms the findings for women in the 1970s: the availability of unilateral divorce substantially decreases married women's time spent on housework. The results suggest that the adoption of unilateral divorce law shifts the relative bargaining power within heterosexual married households to women.","[Genadek, Katie R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, 1440 15th St, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Genadek, KR (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, 1440 15th St, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",katie.genadek@colorado.edu,,,Minnesota Population Center from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [P2C HD041023]; Time Use Data Access System from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD053654]; IPUMS Redesign from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD043392],Minnesota Population Center from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD); Time Use Data Access System from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD); IPUMS Redesign from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD),"This work was supported by the Minnesota Population Center (P2C HD041023), the Time Use Data Access System (R01HD053654), and IPUMS Redesign (R01HD043392), all funded through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).",,60,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Note that the scope and degree of pathological phenomena in the public procurement system is largely influenced by applicable legislation in this field. Admittedly, regularly introduced legal institutions intended to reduce improper behavior proved to be partly ineffective. Curbing the risk of irregularity in the field of public procurement requires a multi-faceted impact, including efficient checks by the special bodies.

Qualitative information, obtained in successive fieldwork campaigns, was used to assess trends and structure uncertainty. Empirical data also helped to describe three future scenarios that oscillate between the continuation of current agro-neoliberal trends (facilitated by the appropriation of sustainability and innovation agendas), the return of strong state interventions or the decline and eventual collapse of the agribusiness sector (due to sanitary risks or politico-economic reactions). The overall conclusion is that it is difficult to envisage the emergence of any radical alternative focused on agrarian justice or the production of basic food. Alternative developments would require a strong coordination of national and international social groups and political will to construct a different future for farmers, consumers and wider society.","[Ioris, Antonio A.

Obtaining reliable estimates of removal costs, however, is challenging because the effectiveness of invasive species control is often unobserved. As a result, there are few, if any, estimates of invasive species removal costs in the literature. To address this challenge, we couple a spatial population dynamics model with standard econometric methods and estimate a removal cost function when control effectiveness is unobserved. Our cost estimates are based on unique panel data from 2004-2011 for 122 sites in the Invasive Spartina Project, a control program in the California San Francisco Bay Area. Contrary to common assumptions on removal costs in the invasive species literature, we find that removal costs are linear in removal suggesting that a bang-bang type of control is optimal, which is largely consistent with the Invasive Spartina Project's policy of rapid eradication.

The article aims to study the competitive strategy of Zara, its ability to adapt to the changing business environment, as well as to define the major competitive advantages in comparison with the direct competitors. Inditex has a number of brands in the low-price, middle-price, and the high-price segments of the clothing market. The authors analyze the competitive positions of Inditex in the middle-price segment of the Russian clothing market, with the Zara brand as the most popular one among the customers. The market is selected for the case study, because being one of the most promising regional markets, it is at the same time challenging for a European producer due to differences in consumer preferences and purchasing patterns. The authors' approach of the analysis is based on Porter's five forces of competition. Numerical score is used to evaluate the threats of intra -industry competition. It is concluded that the Russian women's clothing market is characterized by a high level of saturation, tough competition, and slowing pace of growth. The authors identify the main competitive advantages of Inditex in comparison to the direct competitors: Benetton, Marks & Spencer, H&M and GAP. Inditex is the market leader, with Zara securing half of the company's market share, thus being the most recognizable clothing brand in many countries of the company's presence. The success of Zara proves that the company's strategy is adaptive and competitive. At the same time, the analysis reveals changes in the business environment. The buyers are currently focused mainly on offline shopping. However, Zara's main competitors develop online stores and delivery services. As estimated by the authors, the threat of intra -industry competition is high; competition with online stores will be increasing. The threat of new players entering the clothing market is estimated as high. The threat of losing consumers of the Zara brand is estimated to have an average degree. The threat of loss of suppliers is low. The authors propose managerial tactics and formulate development strategy basics. The paper presents the following opportunities for Zara promotion: increasing online sales, expanding sales through large outlets and closing small stores, preserving the existing solutions and searching for new ways of differentiating the brand, reducing costs by developing clusters of suppliers.","[Kapustina, Larisa; Agababaev, Mushfig; Drevalev, Andrei] Ural State Univ Econ, 62,8 Marta Str, Ekaterinburg 620219, Russia",Ural State University of Economics,"Kapustina, L (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, 62,8 Marta Str, Ekaterinburg 620219, Russia.",lakapustina@bk.ru; agmush@yandex.ru; adrevalev@usue.ru,"Drevalev, Andrei A/G-7692-2015; Древалев, Андрей/HHN-6897-2022",,,,,,19,0,0,1,45,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,779,791,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200068,0

Traditional delivery of this lesson is, however, limited in its scope of application and can be unnecessarily convoluted. The author shows that the universe of application is greatly expanded and a more transparent logic is embraced by noting that definition of Pareto efficiency directly implies the tangency of aggregate production/endowment and aggregate weakly preferred sets. This tangency condition can itself serve as a necessary condition for Pareto optima. For convex, but not necessarily differentiable, environments this tangency condition implies nonempty intersection of multi-valued marginal rates of substitution and transformation rather than outright identity.","[Kolpin, Van] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Kolpin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",vkolpin@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The dispute concerned India's import prohibition affecting certain agricultural products from countries reporting Notifiable Avian Influenza (NAI) to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The United States complained that India's Avian Influenza (AI) measures amounted to an import prohibition that was not based on the relevant international standard (the OIE Terrestrial Code) or on a scientific risk assessment. The provisions invoked were provisions from the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures SPS Agreement) and the panel found in its report that the measures undertaken by India are inconsistent with inter alia Articles 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.6 of the SPS agreement. Article XX (b) of GATT which provides for exceptions related to protect human, animal or plant life or health (... nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures. necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health) was not invoked by India to justify its measures related to the import of poultry products from US. In a different dispute - United States - Certain Measures Affecting Imports of Poultry from China - the Panel Report was circulated on 29 September 2010. Certain measures that were initiated by US were disputed by China in the Panel Proceedings. As with the India - US dispute referred in paragraph above, several provisions of the SPS Agreement were invoked. US however invoked Article XX (b) of GATT to justify its measures of restricting imports from China. The panel presented a finding that measures adopted by the US were inconsistent with not only the provisions of the SPS agreement but also with the provisions of Article XX (b) of the GATT. Though the present dispute related to the import of poultry products from China and the measures imposed and adopted by the US to restrict imports from China were on grounds different to the ones invoked in the present India - US dispute besides the SPS agreement, yet the case is relevant from the point of view of understanding the present dispute as the findings of the panel in both the disputes are identical though the reasons for the measures imposed are different. This article seeks to compare and analyse the Panel Report in the India - Measures Concerning the Importation of Certain Agricultural Products from the United States (hereinafter India - Measures) and the Panel report in United States - Certain Measures Affecting Imports of Poultry from China (US - Measures) and present an understanding on the invocation of Article XX (b) for cases involving consumption of food of animal origin. The article would seek to analyse the reasoning and findings of the panel in both the disputes and attempt to analyse the similarities and differences in the two reports. It would then present its analysis regarding the need and utility of invoking Article XX (b) of GATT looking at the interpretation of the provision in the previous Panel and Appellate body reports.","[Mayank, Veer] Sikkim Univ, Dept Law, Gangtok, Sikkim, India",Sikkim University,"Mayank, V (通讯作者)，Sikkim Univ, Dept Law, Gangtok, Sikkim, India.",veer.mayank@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The Majority Voting Ensemble method is superior in prediction accuracy to single classifier models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine, but the computational cost is very expensive since it considers all the hyperparameters of single classifier models. The current study proposes a revision of the majority voting method to improve the computational efficiency. The proposed method lets each single classifier model find its own hyperparameter values and this modification speeds up the computation by 500 times compared to the standard majority voting method while maintaining the accuracy. The numerical experiments show the ranking of the classifier models in the order of the proposed majority voting, the standard majority voting, and then other single classifier models including the support vector machine. This improvement will allow the majority voting ensemble method to be applied in the financial market in practice. The algorithms are tested on 7 national indices from 3 continents for the past 3 years, and the performance is measured in two criteria, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the percent correctly classified.","[Moon, Kyoung-Sook] Gachon Univ, Math Finance, Seongnam, South Korea; [Jun, Sookyung; Kim, Hongjoong] Korea Univ, Math, Seoul, South Korea",Gachon University; Korea University,"Moon, KS (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Math Finance, Seongnam, South Korea.",ksmoon@gachon.ac.kr; tnzzzrud@korea.ac.kr; hongjoong@korea.ac.kr,,,Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2014R1A1A2058271]; Gachon University,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); Gachon University",The research of Kim was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2014R1A1A2058271).

The relationship between a country's economic development level (measured as GDP per capita) and labour productivity in the agriculture and across the entire agribusiness was measured in 39 countries around the world (which are entered to the World Input-Output Database and for which the relevant I/O tables were prepared) in 2000 and 2014. The input-output analysis, employed as the main research method, enabled the calculation of value added in the agriculture and elsewhere in the agribusiness. The results suggest the existence of a positive linear association between agribusiness labour productivity and economic development level, as corroborated by previous observations. In turn, two separate groups are noticeable in the relationship between agricultural labour productivity and the level of development of a country. In the first group of countries, agricultural labour productivity grows fast as the economy grows whereas in the second group, the growth rate of labour productivity clearly decreases as the economy grows. This study is a part of the discussion on the global agricultural development model which, on the one hand, calls for increasing the productivity of agricultural labour and, on the other, shows a need to reduce environmental degradation.","[Mrowczynska-Kaminska, Aldona; Bajan, Bartlomiej] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Mrówczynska-Kaminska, A; Bajan, B (通讯作者)，Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",mrowczynska-kaminska@up.poznan.pl; bartlomiej.bajan@up.poznan.pl,"Bajan, Bartłomiej/AAV-4825-2021","Bajan, Bartłomiej/0000-0003-1393-6580; Mrowczynska-Kaminska, Aldona/0000-0001-5439-7339",,,,,13,0,0,0,3,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,191,197,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.24,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600024,0

In fact, the EU has fallen into the trap of the economic reality of globalization and the application of virtual neoclassical ideology. The process of structural adjustment of the European Union into the global economy has brought to the surface two contradictions which became differentia specifica of a protracted systemic crisis. The first contradiction will be presented from the aspect of the core-periphery model by describing the development strategies and structural differentiations in the European economic area. The second contradiction of the systemic crisis refers to the erosion of 'the social state and national state'. Discrepancies between the promoted values for economic and social equality and the widening economic gap among the states make this process of erosion very obvious. This creates a dangerous potential for opening a new chapter in European history which will be characterized by intense processes of disintegration and fragmentation, deepening of the connection with the elite agglomerate enclaves of mega-capitalism and reducing the power of the national (social) state. Both processes have a common denominator and are products of the global market capitalism and the functional integration of mega capital. They confront the EU with the challenge to improve the competitiveness of its economy. Thus, the perspectives of the EU regarding its catching up with the global competitiveness will be analyzed from the point of view of this position, and the prospects of the Euro on the global market.","[Natalija, Nikolovska; Daniela, Mamucevska] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Natalija, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia.",natalijan@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; danielam@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,397,409,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_26,0.0,,,13,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500026,0

In this paper, three special distributions such as generalised hyperbolic distribution (GHD), skew Student t distribution (STD), and normal inversed Gaussian distribution (NID) are applied to measure market risk of the four European countries. By analysing the risk management in four European Union markets as United Kingdom, France, Greece and Spain, the final results show that Normal inversed Gaussian distribution outperforms three other models in most of cases (including Normal distribution). Then, the predicting results exhibited the instability of European economy from 2014 to the end of 2018. The risk measurement model did not capture the extreme loss in Greece well. The same situation also happened on Spain. Conversely, England and France were slightly conservative in risk management. Interesting that, the risk forecasting model could predict the  Brexit event in UK instead of other countries.","[Ngan Pham Thi; Duc Tran Cong] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Business Adm, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"Thi, NP (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Business Adm, Tan Phong Ward, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",phamthingan@tdt.edu.vn; trancongduc@tdt.edu.vn,"Tran, Cong Duc/ABE-3243-2020","Tran, Cong Duc/0000-0003-0765-5571",,,,,12,0,0,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1388,1400,,,,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400137,0

The author chooses a qualitative case study research design and explores several research questions: Why is sustainability considered in such intensity? What path dependencies influenced sustainable development? What are the obstacles to the more sustainable university campus? The data were gathered by interviewing main actors, by studying documents, participant observation, and analyzed using standard content analysis method. Path dependence concept was used as the theoretical underpinning. The case study shows, sustainable development evolves not in a linear way; the breakthroughs are achieved by negotiations with various internal and external stakeholders, by the pragmatic attitude of a part of the management team and academics, by embracing various windows of opportunities, including exogenous shocks. Development is strongly influenced by path dependencies and historical contingencies.

Discussions regarding stimulants and barriers of economic development, as well as development disparities and the ways adopted for their measurement can be found in scientific literature. The problem of possible ways and methods of overcoming negative effects of 2008+ global crisis arouses considerable interest of researchers. The main goal of the paper is to examine and evaluate disparities in development of ten Latin American countries. The economic development of the following economies was analysed: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. Because of the complexity of the category of economic development, many elements had to be taken into consideration during the comparative study. The following diagnostic variables were taken into account: GDP growth, GDP per capita, share of service sector in GDP creation, inflation rate, unemployment rate, general government deficit, general government gross debt, infant mortality rate and life expectancy. Selected taxonomic methods were used, and in particular classification and hierarchization methods. Multidimensional comparative analysis resulted in identification of economies in the best economic condition and the worst one. Additionally, the analysed countries were classified into four classes in terms of synthetic measure of economic development. Moreover, the scale of income inequalities in the analysed economies was presented. Finally, international competitiveness of studied Latin American economies was presented.","[Pawlas, Iwona] Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Pawlas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Katowice, Poland.",iwona.pawlas@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,300,309,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300033,0

Input-specific technical inefficiency (pond area and feed) is negatively associated with the experience and education level of pangasius farmers. Location of the farm in a saltwater intrusion area is positively associated with the inefficiency of producing fish. Outcomes of this study are useful to identify successful strategies to minimize the use of inputs while simultaneously maximizing fish production.","[Pham Thi Anh Ngoc; Gaitan-Cremaschi, D.; Meuwissen, Miranda P.

The implementation of the research objective will consist in determining an adequate composition of territorial units for the purpose of analysing economic phenomena related to the situation of agriculture in Poland. Due to the assumed research objective, the author proposed a two-step procedure, the application of which will allow the Aggregation Problem to be solved positively. According to the proposed procedure, the boundaries of agricultural macro-regions were determined based on the analysis of the agrarian structure at the district level (NUTS4). The analysis of the agrarian structure carried out in the paper allowed the determination of homogeneous agricultural macroregions in terms of the culture and development of agriculture.

The results show that the local authorities have been aware of numerous opportunities and barriers of local economic development. Sometimes, if there is one barrier, it causes the formation of new ones, for example the shortage of own financial resources or municipal debt make it impossible to finance investments from the local budget or to apply for EU funds, which require co-financing from the beneficiary's own resources. Most of mayors make efforts to mitigate exogenous conditions by local activeness, such as co-operation with neighbouring or foreign municipalities or offering preferential tax rates to investors.

Theories of economic development and political economy, such as world-systems theory and Petty's Law, are being contested by the digital revolution. As technological advances bypass old theory, the service sector is locating globally, with decreasing regard for geography and the assumptions of the old international economic order. This presents new challenges for a legal, commercial and international trade norms and system, which are designed to facilitate tangible cross-border commerce. Old theories of political economy must be revisited to account for the rise of digitally traded services and some, like Petty's Law, may not survive emergent conditions. The services trade itself is inadequately considered in official government policy, and by international organizations seeking to promote trade, investment and greater cooperation. This work critically evaluates the policy initiatives of major players in trade in light of these trends in the digital economy. While economic institutions claim to advocate policies that are up to date with the new reality of trade, their approaches are still grounded in the superseded economic theories of the twentieth century.","[Robbins, Mark] Univ Toronto, Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Robbins, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",mark.robbins@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,54,4,4,7,82,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Convergence/divergence is studied through two different concepts: sigma- and beta-convergence. following results were obtained. Firstly, the study of sigma-convergence does not provide convincing evidence in favor of the unification of fertility levels in the regions. Secondly, research into beta-convergence has also not provided definitive proof that regions are becoming more homogenous as regards fertility levels. Thirdly, a comparison of the convergence of total fertility rate and crude birth rate shows that the level of the latter indicator is more homogenous, and the pace of their convergence is higher. The conclusions are as follows. Regional imbalances in fertility rates persist and are not declining over time. Evidently, countries composed of many constituent parts with a high degree of variability as regards demographic development require demographic policies that are aimed at smoothing regional variations. However, it appears that the active implementation of federal and regional demographic policies in Russia has yet to make a positive impact as regards mitigating these differences.","[Shubat, Oksana] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shubat, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",o.m.shubat@urfu.ru,"Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144",Russian Federation [NSh-3429.2018.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Fertility and parenting in Russian regions: models, invigoration strategies, forecasts, supported by the President of Russian Federation, project no.

The economics of monetary unification analyze the (mainly economic) costs and benefits that member states draw from replacing multiple national currencies with a single currency. The political factor has been habitually put aside as the benevolent despot view of the government was tacitly embraced with regard to the creation of the monetary union. Similarly, the process of euro adoption by countries that entered the European Union (EU) later is usually described as being driven by economic factors. The process of nominal and real convergence with older members has been carefully analyzed. Much less weight has been put on the complex interaction of economic and political dimensions during preparations for euro adoption, such as the political interests of national governments and their relation with major internal economic players. The multifaceted interplay of economic and political factors suggests the opportunity to take a political economy perspective on this complex issue. In this sense, a number of key political-economy related issues can be distilled in relation to the process of euro adoption, which will structure the following analysis. What are the key national winners and losers of this possible event? What role has interest-groups pressure played in this process? Under what circumstances may bureaucracies such as the central bank body of experts act as a deterrent for the political end that is the common currency adoption? How are internationally exposed companies expected to behave and to promote their interests in relation to this event? What is the relative importance of the internal politics dynamic for euro adoption? We rely on process tracing to approach these questions for the Romanian case. Policy documents, newspaper articles, academic articles, economic indicators and elite interviews are used to create an analytical narrative based both on a one-point-in-time description of the situation and on a timeline that lists the sequence of some relevant events. We argue that a specific combination of economic and political factors leads to the failed euro adoption in Romania.","[Simandan, Radu; Leustean, Beatrice; Dobrescu, Razvan] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Simandan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania.",radu.simandan@upb.ro; beatrice.leustean@upb.ro; razvan.dobrescu@upb.ro,"Dobrescu, Razvan/AAX-7663-2020; Dobrescu, Razvan/ACW-5055-2022; Simandan, Radu/GRT-0057-2022; Simandan, Radu/AAC-6062-2021; Simandan, Radu/GQH-3169-2022","Dobrescu, Razvan/0000-0002-6390-5400; Simandan, Radu/0000-0001-6003-6695; Simandan, Radu/0000-0001-6003-6695;",,,,,30,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,53,62,,,,,,10,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200005,0

Although the industry is mature, there is only a limited number of papers investigating deal sites adoption and use from a customer perspective. Most of the research published on the topic is rather exploratory than using existing theories. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is an information systems theory that explains adoption and continued usage behavior. There already exists the second version of the theory. The aim of this research is to test if UTAUT and UTAUT2 motives influence intention to use deal sites. As it is a preliminary study, only four core UTAUT and core seven UTUAT2 (a superset of UTAUT) motives are investigated, not factors moderating the core motives.

The sample comprises of top 100 listed firms in Vietnam. Specifically, financial statement figures of pre-adoption period and post-adoption are utilized. Descriptive statistics and least square regression are conducted to analyse the effect of new corporate accounting regime adoption on earnings management. To examine earnings management from the perspective of managing earnings toward a positive target, this study pools all observations for the pre-adoption and the post-adoption periods to measure the frequency of small positive earnings. The finding suggests that there has been an improvement to accounting quality after Vietnamese listed firms moved to new corporate accounting regime. In particular, the result indicates that the pervasiveness of earnings management by way of smoothing has reduced post-adoption.","[Trang Cam Hoang] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Tan Phong Ward,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"Hoang, TC (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho St,Tan Phong Ward,Dist 7, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",hoangcamtrang@tdt.edu.vn,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,572,579,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400057,0

It is common knowledge that consumer debt, especially mortgage, is a major factor of quantitative and qualitative changes of living conditions of households. Housing conditions belong to most commonly investigated aggregative social data in many respects. Research on the role of indebtedness in changing housing conditions is a rather neglected area in this field. Recent significant increase in household debt is a good opportunity to investigate its relationship with household conditions. We use data from the household budget survey conducted by the Polish Central Statistical Office during the period 2005-2015. Using microlevel data, we assess various symptoms (diagnostic features) related to both flat size and quality. We have adopted the mathematical theory of fuzzy sets to construct a multidimensional index to examine housing conditions. Similar to the analysis of the risk of poverty, the hazard indicator for poor housing has been calculated for each household. On average, we have found improvement of housing conditions in Poland after accession to the European Union. As expected, our research demonstrates that indebted households are characterised by better quality of housing.","[Walega, Agnieszka] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Walega, Grzegorz] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Walega, A (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",agnieszka.walega@uek.krakow.pl; grzegorz.walega@uek.krakow.pl,"Wałęga, Agnieszka/ABD-6566-2021; Wałęga, Grzegorz/T-9206-2019","Wałęga, Grzegorz/0000-0002-4355-5204; Walega, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6386-0433","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) [UMO-2015/19/D/HS4/02569]","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland)(National Science Centre, Poland)","This paper was supported by funds from the National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) through grant No. UMO-2015/19/D/HS4/02569.",,14,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,573,582,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.58,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700058,0

First, a dataset of 2,162 observations was obtained for three metric variables describing economic efficiency of small manufacturing enterprises. These unit-level data were aggregated at district level and turned into interval-valued symbolic data. Economic efficiency of small manufacturing enterprises was evaluated using a hybrid approach. In the first step, multidimensional scaling (see Borg and Groenen, 2005; Mair et al., 2017) is applied to obtain a visual representation of objects in a two-dimensional space. In the next step, a set of objects is ordered linearly based on the Euclidean distance from the pattern (ideal) object. The proposed approach provides new possibilities for interpreting linearly ordered results of a set of objects.","[Walesiak, Marek] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Comp Sci, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland; [Dehnel, Grazyna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Walesiak, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Comp Sci, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",marek.walesiak@ue.wroc.pl; g.dehnel@ue.poznan.pl,"Walega, Agnieszka/T-9466-2019; Walesiak, Marek/B-2937-2018; Wałęga, Grzegorz/T-9206-2019; Dehnel, Grażyna GD/R-1552-2018","Walega, Agnieszka/0000-0002-6386-0433; Walesiak, Marek/0000-0003-0922-2323; Wałęga, Grzegorz/0000-0002-4355-5204; Dehnel, Grażyna GD/0000-0002-0072-9681",Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2015/17/B/HS4/00905],Polish National Science Centre,The project is financed by the Polish National Science Centre DEC-2015/17/B/HS4/00905.,,20,4,4,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,563,572,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.57,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700057,0

This paper discusses landscape planning as strategy to improve connectivity in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of ecologically valuable areas across land owners. A tax-fund system is proposed, that following the principle of conunon but differentiated responsibility, tries to spread the burden of conservation equally across land owners while optimizing the environmental outcome. Design options of such a tax-fund system are discussed along the lines of a simple theoretical model. Financial effects of a tax-fund system are computed for a small model landscape set in Sweden. Two design questions stand out as particularly important. The first is whether the policy is intended to be self-sustained among the land owners or if the budget can be supplemented by general tax, money. The second is whether the land owners or the relevant authority select the stands for conservation set-aside.","[Zabel, Astrid] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci, Langgasse 85, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland; [Bostedt, Goran; Ekvall, Hans] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, CERE, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Bostedt, Goran; Ekvall, Hans] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, SLU, Dept Forest Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Zabel, A (通讯作者)，Bern Univ Appl Sci, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci, Langgasse 85, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland.",astrid.zabel@bfh.ch,"Zabel, Astrid/B-6580-2009","Zabel, Astrid/0000-0002-3953-7505; Bostedt, Goran/0000-0002-6540-743X","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [802-0243-15]; EFINORD, the Northern Regional Office of the European Forest Institute","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; EFINORD, the Northern Regional Office of the European Forest Institute","We kindly acknowledge funding by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency Dnr: 802-0243-15.

'The article argues that the non-market economy antidumping rule contemplated in Article 15 must be terminated according to the fifteen-year deadline. Through a careful examination of the negotiating records of Article 15 and China's Accession Protocol under both the GA'TT/WTO multilateral negotiations and the US-China bilateral negotiations, the article submits that the bilateral records show convincingly that the compromise reached between the US and China on Article 15 was that while China accepted the application of the special antidumping rule, the US agreed that the rule would remain applicable for fifteen years only. There were no negotiating records to suggest that this compromise was not endorsed by the WTO membership.

Boreal forests have long been an important contributor to commodity products. However, in recent decades, commercial production in the boreal forest industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from traditional wood products to multiple value-added products including residues for bioenergy production. In order to help decision makers select economically optimal forest management alternatives, we conducted an empirical study, the first of its kind, to explore the impact of varying silvicultural intensities, forest compositions, rotation ages, and harvest methods on profits in a portion of boreal forest in Northwestern Ontario. We found that silvicultural intensity, forest composition, rotation age, and harvest method significantly affected profit. The profit was on average the highest from coniferous stands, followed by mixedwood and broadleaved compositions. The profits in mixedwood stands increased continuously with rotation age using both Full-Tree to Roadside Tree-Length-to-Mill harvesting method (FT-TL) and Full-Tree to Roadside Shortwood-to-Mill method (FT-SW), and increased with rotation age but decreased at late-succession stage using Cut-to-Length method (CTL). The profits were on average higher using FT-TL than using FT-SW and CTL. The maximum profit ($3305/ha) was solved for low silvicultural intensity (conifer conifer), with a rotation age of 100 years, using the FT-TL harvest method. This analysis provides an example of finding economically optimal forest management solutions.","[Chen, Si; Shahi, Chander; Chen, Han Y.

The rejection of the unit root test suggests that it is also not I(1). It is estimated that log prices are fractionally integrated with A grade prices being I(0.78) and the natural logarithm of A grade prices being I(0.83). The implication is that log prices should be modelled using fraction Brownian motion (FBM) rather than geometric Brownian motion (GBM) or as a stationary autoregressive process. The difference in the NPV calculated using FBM compared to the NPV of classic Faustmann or GBM depends on the fractional difference, log price and volatility. Analysis of the extended A grade price series indicates an H value of about 0.3. At this level the differences at stand age 0, from both Faustmann and GBM, are modest in terms of NPV. However the differences are marked in terms of reserve log price strategy, probability of harvest and rotation age. Differences in NPV between FBM and Faustmann increase and become material as volatility increases.","[Manley, Bruce] Univ Canterbury, New Zealand Sch Forestry, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Niquidet, Kurt] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Canterbury; Bank of Canada,"Manley, B (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, New Zealand Sch Forestry, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",bruce.manley@canterbury.ac.nz; KNiquidet@bank-banque-canada.ca,,,,,,,34,8,8,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017,85.0,,1.0,,,,76,84,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.08.017,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR3SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418986200008,0

With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted. Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security.

This raises questions about whether and how risk information is understood and acted upon, and how responses vary across contexts. To characterize such variation, we stratified a randomized experiment related to household water quality across two periurban areas in Cambodia. When we showed specific evidence of water contamination to lower-SES households who were initially more optimistic about water safety, they altered their beliefs about health risk and increased their demand for a treatment product. However, demand for the treatment product among higher and initially more pessimistic SES households did not change significantly. These findings highlight the importance of better understanding heterogeneity in the specific drivers of responses to health risk information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to consequences for climate change, present-day health externalities may also substantially increase the social cost of coal. Health consequences of air pollution have proven important in studies of developed countries, but, despite clear importance, similarly well-identified estimates are less available for developing countries, and no estimates exist for the important case of coal in India. We exploit panel data on Indian households, matched to local changes in exposure to coal plants. Increased exposure to coal plants is associated with worse respiratory health. Consistent with a causal mechanism, the effect is specific: no effect is seen on diarrhea or fever, and no effect on respiratory health is seen of new non-coal plants. Our result is not due to endogenous avoidance behavior, or to differential trends in determinants of respiratory health, either before the period studied or simultaneously. (C) 2017 The Authors.

One hundred and nineteen patient-caregiver dyads participated in our multicenter observational cost-of-illness study. The modified Resource Utilization in Dementia Questionnaire was used as the main tool to collect data from patients and caregivers. Medical specialists provided additional data from medical records. The average costs of dementia were calculated and patients were then divided by the level of cognitive impairment. A generalized linear model was used to determine if differences were present for selected cost variables. The mean (standard deviation) for direct cost per a patient in a month was estimated to be a,notsign243.0 (138.0), a,notsign1727.1 (1075.6) for the indirect cost, and a,notsign1970.0 (1090.3) for the total cost of dementia in the Czech Republic. All of the costs increased as dementia severity increased. Both the indirect and total costs significantly (p < 0.05) increased if patients were living with their primary caregiver, and if the severity of cognitive impairment was increased. The indirect cost, which was represented mainly by informal care, comprised the main part of the total cost of care for patients with dementia in the Czech Republic.

We construct a dedicated child deprivation indicator that allows us to better capture children's circumstances and examine the effect on them of country and sociodemographic factors jointly through multilevel models. We contribute to the scarce literature on the effects of social spending on child-specific deprivation from a cross-national perspective. We separately estimate the effect of each social benefit function on child deprivation to evaluate whether functions directly targeted at children are more effective than functions with no explicit intention of child deprivation protection. Our findings suggest that child deprivation is sensitive to household and country characteristics, the latter dimension being crucial to explain differences across European countries in the extent of child deprivation. Moreover, social benefits play a key role that remains even when controlling for country-level determinants. Finally, the most effective social benefit functions are not necessarily those targeted at children.","[Barcena-Martin, Elena] Univ Malaga, Fac Econ, C El Ejido 6, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Blazquez, Maite] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Budria, Santiago] CEEAplA, ICADE, Madrid, Spain; [Budria, Santiago] IZA, Madrid, Spain; [Moro-Egido, Ana I.] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Autonomous University of Madrid; Comillas Pontifical University; University of Granada,"Bárcena-Martín, E (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Econ, C El Ejido 6, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",barcenae@uma.es,"Blazquez, Maite/V-8795-2018; MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./O-3432-2014; Barcena-Martin, Elena/J-4833-2013; Budria, Santiago/F-4542-2011","Blazquez, Maite/0000-0002-2152-890X; MORO-EGIDO, ANA I./0000-0002-5992-1408; Barcena-Martin, Elena/0000-0002-6381-7507; Budria, Santiago/0000-0001-5537-4059",Government of Spain [ECO2012-33993]; Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies; Fundacion Ramon Areces,Government of Spain(Spanish Government); Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies; Fundacion Ramon Areces,"The financial support from the Government of Spain through grant ECO2012-33993 to all the authors; the Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies to Ana I.

This paper analyzes the establishment of a REDD + pilot project in Kilosa district, Tanzania. It documents changes in organizations and institutions for land management undertaken to enable villagers to produce and sell stored carbon. Moreover, it evaluates the legitimacy both of the process of introducing REDD + and the outcomes in the form of new governance structures. We find that establishing tradable carbon is demanding. In fact, no carbon has yet been sold. We observe that while the Kilosa REDD + pilot managed to engage local communities to a rather unusual extent, the case also showed that introducing REDD + 'on the ground' faces several challenges regarding legitimacy.","[Vatn, Arild; Mosi, Elvis; Nantongo, Maria] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Kajembe, George; Silayo, Dos Santos] Sokoine Univ Agr, CHUO KIKUU, POB 3000, Morogoro, Tanzania",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Vatn, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",arild.vatn@mnbu.no,,"Silayo, Dos Santos/0000-0003-3580-2209",Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation [GLO-3035 QZA-10/0308]; Norwegian Research Council [230296],Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This research is supported financially by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Project no GLO-3035 QZA-10/0308) and the Norwegian Research Council (project no 230296).

This study clarified the burden of informal caregivers quantitatively and provided policy implications for long-term care policies in countries with aging populations. Using data collected from a nationwide five-wave panel survey in Japan, I examined two causal relationships: (1) high-intensity caregiving and mental health of informal caregivers, and (2) high-intensity caregiving and continuation of caregiving. Considering the heterogeneity in high-intensity caregiving among informal caregivers, control function model which allows for heterogeneous treatment effects was used. This study uncovered three major findings. First, hours of caregiving was found to influence the continuation of high-intensity caregiving among non-working informal caregivers and irregular employees. Specifically, caregivers who experienced high-intensity caregiving (20-40 h) tended to continue with it to a greater degree than did caregivers who experienced ultra-high-intensity caregiving (40 h or more). Second, high-intensity caregiving was associated with worse mental health among non-working caregivers, but did not have any effect on the mental health of irregular employees. The control function model revealed that caregivers engaging in high-intensity caregiving who were moderately mentally healthy in the past tended to have serious mental illness currently. Third, non-working caregivers did not tend to continue high-intensity caregiving for more than three years, regardless of co-residential caregiving. This is because current high-intensity caregiving was not associated with the continuation of caregiving when I included high-intensity caregiving provided during the previous period in the regression. Overall, I noted distinct impacts of high-intensity caregiving on the mental health of informal caregivers and that such caregiving is persistent among non-working caregivers who experienced it for at least a year. Supporting non-working intensive caregivers as a public health issue should be considered a priority.","[Kumagai, Narimasa] Kindai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan",Kindai University (Kinki University),"Kumagai, N (通讯作者)，Kindai Univ, Fac Econ, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.",narimasa@kindai.ac.jp,,"KUMAGAI, Narimasa/0000-0002-6303-7420","Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (JSPS KAKENHI Grant) [JP15K03528]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03528] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (JSPS KAKENHI Grant); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful for the helpful comments of anonymous reviewers, professors Seiritsu Ogura and Haruko Noguchi.

An analysis of Brazil's recent forest governance changes allows to outline the political dynamics, thrust and ideas that most influence the use of forests in a political economy whose overall developmental and environmental policies are defined primarily by agribusiness. The Brazilian Congress passed a New Forest Code in 2012, greatly relaxing the previous Code from 1965. The law-changing project was an illustration of the tension between the large landholders-lobby, and the new sustainability demands of various sorts of green economy proponents. The recent framing of forests by the agribusiness lobby and the Minister of Agriculture are assessed to explain why and how the understanding and pathway of sustainability in relation to forest and other land uses has changed since 2012. Studies on the major impacts of the post-2012 forest laws are also reviewed. A novel approach is taken, uniting an analysis of large-scale agriculture, tree plantation companies, and socio-environmentalists. It is shown how the New Forest Code and other measures that have brought together the agricultural and forestry frontiers, policies and vocabularies in Brazil have made their united analysis necessary. Brazil provides an important case to study how some parts of the brown economy and green capitalism pathways are supporting each other in practice, and how the forest industry has become a key actor in this alliance, to the detriment of socio-environmentalism.

In this compliance proceeding, the United States claimed that the Redetermination issued by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) continued to violate WTO law. At the center of the dispute were MOFCOM's findings that the US imports had the effect of suppressing and/or depressing the prices of domestic like products. While the Panel reached the conclusion that the MOFCOM findings were inconsistent with WTO rules, it did not clarify the criteria for determining such price effects. In this comment, we call for the adoption of a clearer and more objective standard for determining price suppression and price depression in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, via the tools of economic modeling.","[Qin, Julia] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Qin, Julia] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Vandenbussche, Hylke] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",Wayne State University; Tsinghua University; KU Leuven,"Qin, J (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.;Qin, J (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ya.qin@wayne.edu; Hylke.Vandenbussche@kuleuven.be,,"Vandenbussche, Hylke/0000-0002-4073-0097",,,,,7,1,1,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2017,16.0,2,,,,,203,226,,10.1017/S1474745616000513,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EQ6NA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398197500004,0

This article uses Markov chain analysis to study the labour market transitions of South Korean women in different age groups. It shows the importance of differentiating the effects of contemporary labour market conditions, shaped by the forces of the moment, from conditions created by the institutional legacy of the past. Women's traditional position in the labour market has resulted in age-linked gendered precariousness, while the conditions of the moment are generating a tendency towards less precarious employment. Transition matrices are developed for types of precarious employment defined by the combination of job stability and job quality, taking into account duration by age group, time period, and covariates. These matrices yield distributions of asymptotic prevalence, reflecting labour market conditions of the moment. The forces of the moment favour the predominance of stable good-quality employment, whereas observed prevalence at a given date is characterised by the polarisation of the labour market between stable good-quality and unstable bad-quality employment. Asymptotic prevalence reveals a steady increase in stable but bad-quality employment. Older women are observed mostly in unstable bad-quality employment, but labour market conditions are tending to attenuate this age cleavage over time, as the conditions of the moment are reducing the proportions of older women in stable bad-quality and unstable good-quality employment. The conclusion is an age-based polarisation, in which older women are faring badly, but where possibilities are now opening up to younger South Korean women, reflected in the sharp break between the situation inherited from the past and the conditions of the moment. But possibilities for younger women will be realised only through a reinforcement of government policies to support career breaks and work-family balance through decent part-time jobs.

This paper investigates two potential strategies to reduce adverse selection: (1) differentiating the premium to the duration of the contract for which the VD holds (ex-ante approach) and (2) differentiating the premium to the number of years for which insured have opted for a VD (ex-post approach). It can be hypothesized that premiums will decrease with the duration of the contract or the number of years for which insured have opted for a VD, providing an incentive to insured to opt for a deductible also in (incidental) years they expect relatively high expenses. To test this hypothesis, we examine which premium patterns would occur under these strategies using data on healthcare expenses and risk characteristics of over 750,000 insured from 6 years. Our results show that, under the assumptions made, only without risk equalization the premiums could decrease with the duration of the contract or the number of years for which insured have opted for a VD. With (sophisticated) risk equalization, decreasing premiums seem unfeasible, both under the ex-ante and ex-post approach. Given these findings, we are sceptical about the feasibility of these strategies to counteract adverse selection.","[van Winssen, K. P. M.; van Kleef, R. C.; van de Ven, W. P. M.

When deciding where and how protection of land should be achieved (e.g., through different contracting arrangements), conservation organizations must account and plan for variation in the costs of protecting land if they are to make efficient use of the limited resources they have available. We seek to examine how the costs of protected area acquisition are affected by the size of the protected areas under a fee simple or permanent easement transaction, as well as in comparison to unprotected forest parcels. In particular, we sought to determine whether acquisition costs show economies of scale under fee simple and permanent easement transactions while controlling for the effects of other covariates and how these economies of scale are different from those of unprotected areas. We use as a case study areas acquired by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a land trust, to protect Central and Southern Appalachian forest ecosystems of the US. We compare TNC's protected forest sites with other land transactions not purchased for conservation but that share similar characteristics as inferred by the statistical technique of propensity score matching. First, we found that fee simple transactions achieve economies of Scale, whereas permanent easement transactions do not. Further, the comparison of the elasticities of acquisition costs with respect to Size between the protected and unprotected areas clearly show evidence that the presence Of a large conservatiorl organization as a buyer leads to deviations from general market behavior, likely because the conservation buyer has quite different goals and preferences, including preferences tied specifically to parcel size. These differences underscore the value of further studies of this type, which focus on protected area transactions per se rather than broader market trends, if we are to account for the costs of conservation correctly when designing habitat protection programs.

This should be thought of as a movie rather than static images and includes emotions. Mental time travel is still a new method in foresight processes, in generating futures, futures research or future-oriented technology analysis (FTA) in general, and is only rarely used to open up the minds of participants at the beginning of workshops so that their thinking does not remain fixed in the past or the present. Time travelling can be applied to different cases and at different stages of a foresight process (phases of strategic intelligence gathering, sense-making or even implementation), e.g. participants are also able to think disruptively in new pictures instead of just extrapolating from the past. Clinical and psychological studies do not yet exist for this kind of time travel, but first experiences from very different foresight processes are available. This paper presents the experiences gained from six national and international foresight cases, in which time travel was applied. Different ways of performing it are reported and set in the context of the specific foresight process concepts. Experiences are shared by examining the lessons learned and the pros and cons of this new method, so that the organizers of foresight processes can better assess how the method could fit their specific context, objectives, method mix and participants.

Using a non-equilibrium structuralist macroeconomic model, it demonstrates that the dual aim of economic growth and increases in men's and women's employment can be achieved by adopting gender-sensitive expansionary macroeconomic policies. Based on historical data series, three scenarios for Europe for the 2015-25 period are compared: continued austerity, a gender-neutral expansionary scenario, and a gendered expansionary scenario. Projections for the gendered expansionary scenario suggest that 7.4 million more jobs could be created for women in the Eurozone and United Kingdom by reversing austerity policies and gendering and increasing government expenditure and private investment. Further, higher growth rates under this scenario lead to significant reductions of debt-to-GDP ratios and lower budget deficits. The study recommends Europe should roll back austerity policies and embark on a new gender-aware economic trajectory.","[Bargawi, Hannah] Univ London, SOAS, Econ, Thornhaugh St Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Cozzi, Giovanni] Univ Greenwich, Ringgold Standard Inst, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Greenwich,"Bargawi, H (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Econ, Thornhaugh St Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",hb19@soas.ac.uk; gfcozzi@gmail.com,,,"FEPS, Brussels","FEPS, Brussels","This work has been made possible by generous financial support from FEPS, Brussels.

The paper provides an analysis of certain tendencies in the CJS, general information on the PL and a possible positive effect of a wider PL implementation. During the last 5-year period, the CJS records generally lower numbers of unsolved cases, but the number of solved cases relates to the number of new cases. Such results cast doubts on the improvement of efficiency of Croatian judiciary as predominantly curative social instrument. The PL concept is opposite to such reactive model. The PL, sometimes being related to, or considered a synonym for, the preventive law, law as competitive source etc., has recently been supported by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) urging a shifting in the existing paradigms. Further local empirical researches have been restricted due to a limited material basis and novelty of the PL concept. The paper contains theoretical support and elementary directions for an effective CJS improvement in practice. Such improvement would have been primarily achieved by means of reducing the inflow of new court cases to the CJS, thus unburdening the CJS itself, allowing its limited capabilities to be redistributed towards an overall speed and quality, rather than quantity only.

The estimation compares how investor-owned (IOs) plants in states with restructuring changed their behavior relative to IOs in states without. Our analysis finds that restructuring led to: (1) a 1.4 percent improvement in fuel efficiency, (2) an 8 percent decrease in unit cost of heat input, and (3) a lower capacity factor even after adjusting for cross-plant generation re-allocation due to dost reductions.

We find that spending on FEMA ex-ante mitigation and planning projects leads to greater reductions in property losses than spending on ex-post adaptation programs - specifically, a one percent increase in annual spending on ex-ante risk reduction and warning projects reduces damages by 0.21 percent while a one percent increase in ex post recovery and clean-up spending reduces damages by 0.12. Although both types of program spending are effective, we find the marginal return from spending on programs that target long-term mitigation and risk management to be almost twice that of spending on ex-post recovery programs. With the predicted increases in the frequency and severity of North Atlantic hurricanes in the future, our findings suggest there are important potential gains that could be realized from the further diversification of FEMA spending across project categories.

Regional countries were confronted with a huge number of refugees coming from different parts of the world, as well refugees coming from neighbouring countries. The Republic of Macedonia became a transit country within the Balkan states. It is one of the so-called victim countries of the migration process. There is a tendency for migration and asylum processes taking place towards, in and out of Macedonia, bearing in mind its geographical location. Consequently, there has been a need for public institutions to regulate migration processes. During the process of transition, legal acts were signed, amended and annexed which have regulated these issues. During the process of migration, in 2015 in the Republic of Macedonia as well as in other countries in the region many measures were undertaken which have been drastically different to the previous legal bases related to this problem. The main aim of these measures is to provide legal support, transport, and hygienic and food supplements to the refugees on the one hand, whilst providing state security on the other. One serious dilemma for the Republic of Macedonia and other Balkan and European countries is the doubt in the cause for migration: whether it is the armed conflicts in the countries which lies at the origin of migration, or is the main aim for migration which involves looking for better economic living conditions. Bearing in mind that most of the migrants are not fleeing to their neighboring countries, but are heading towards the European Union, makes us conclude that most of them are searching for better economic living conditions.","[Gjorgjievska, Nena Nenovska] Univ Sts Cyril & Methodius, Fac Philosophy, Study Program Int Relat & Conflict Resolut, Skopje, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Gjorgjievska, NN (通讯作者)，Univ Sts Cyril & Methodius, Fac Philosophy, Study Program Int Relat & Conflict Resolut, Skopje, North Macedonia.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,Univ Amer College Skopje,Skopje,"Treta Makedonska Brigada nr. 60,, Skopje, MACEDONIA",,,978-608-4607-39-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,19,33,,,,,,15,Demography; Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics; International Relations,BO5LL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000518175100002,0

In this paper, we study the stability of lEAs in a repeated game framework where we restrict to strategies which are simple and invariant to renegotiation. Our main contribution is that we characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of an IEA when pollution has both a global and local effect. Local pollution spillovers are represented by a network structure. We find that stable IEAs exist if the network structure is balanced. Too large asymmetries in the degree of local spillovers may, however, lead to non-existence of stable structures. We also discuss the implications of our results for welfare.

(with the question mark) was published by Samuel Huntington in Foreign Affairs. Three years later Huntington's expanded thesis was published in book format. Article and book generated both discussion and controversy, given that the author had posited the idea that civilizations, which may also be read as cultural communities or cultural fault lines posed a great threat to world peace in the New World Order that had emerged from the end of the Cold War. Is his work simply rooted in its own time period as a response to Fukuyama's End of History and the Last Man (1989 and 1992) and the beginning of the War against Terrorism (11 September 2001) - roughly a ten yearlong period? Or, does it still resonate today at the 'End of the End of the Cold War' in the continuing aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis, growing terrorism and the rise of right-wing populism? This chapter will revisit Huntington's Clash of Civilizations with reference to key Russian intellectuals writing in the period, most notably Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Igor Chubais and Alexander Dugin. It will demonstrate how these writers have influenced Russian opinion both during the crisis years of the 1990s and in Vladimir Putin's resurgent Russia. The focus of this chapter will be on Russia, Europe and the influence and fluid nature of identity politics.","[Hudson, Robert C.] Univ Derby, European Hist & Cultural Polit, Derby, England; [Hudson, Robert C.] Univ Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Hudson, Robert C.] Exeter Coll Art & Design, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hudson, Robert C.] Univ Rennes, Rennes, France",University of Derby; University of Sarajevo; Universite de Rennes,"Hudson, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Derby, European Hist & Cultural Polit, Derby, England.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,0,Univ Amer College Skopje,Skopje,"Treta Makedonska Brigada nr. 60,, Skopje, MACEDONIA",,,978-608-4607-39-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,149,164,,,,,,16,Demography; Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics; International Relations,BO5LL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000518175100010,0

The results suggest that the detailed classification of extreme net capital flows provides insight into these movements' macroeconomic impacts and policy implementations.","[Hwang, Inbin; Jeong, Deokjong; Park, Hyungsoon; Park, Sunyoung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Daejeon, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Park, S (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Daejeon, South Korea.",sunyoung.park@kaist.ac.kr,"Jeong, DeokJong/AAL-1311-2021; Park, Sunyoung/G-2715-2011","Jeong, DeokJong/0000-0002-4363-0032;","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant - Korean Government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) [NRF-2013R1A1A1076066]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant - Korean Government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) (No. NRF-2013R1A1A1076066).",,42,6,7,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Partnership between private and public sectors in terms of implementing public tasks has been a greatly promoted instrument in recent years in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy (Dobrowolski, 2014, p. 138). The prerequisite for cooperation between the two sectors is primarily trust between the private entity and the public partner. It determines willingness of stakeholders to cooperate and willingness to take joint risk. Today, trust in public institutions is understood as a belief in their competence, diligence and integrity of public institutions. We live in the world of global interdependence, declining level of confidence, increasing uncertainty and risk (Castells, 1996; Bauman, 2007; Beck 2004; Hardin 2009). Although cross-perception of sectors is slowly changing - officials and entrepreneurs are increasingly aware of the mutual benefits of cooperation and strive to build it on partnership - there are still many barriers and unidentified areas of possible cooperation. The purpose of this article is to determine the willingness and level of co-operation between Polish companies and public institutions: both governmental and self-governmental and to identify any barriers that may limit this cooperation. In particular, the factors influencing low level of cooperation between enterprises and public administration institutions in Poland were analyzed. This article uses methods of critical literary analysis and statistical analysis of research conducted among 381 Polish companies based in the Podlaskie province (Poland). Spearman's rank correlations were used in the statistical analysis to determine the relationship between the level of cooperation between companies and public administration institution, cooperation with them and potential for tightening it in the future. In conclusion of the study it should be stressed that the researched companies show a rather low level of willingness to cooperate with public sector institutions. In particular, the respondents indicated low level of cooperation with governmental institutions and weak desire to tighten it in the future. The companies that indicated higher level of cooperation with public institutions assessed higher also the possibility of tightening it in the future. Among the factors influencing current cooperation between enterprises and public institutions evaluated lowest were: the offer prepared by administration, the image of administration in Polish society, the experience of cooperation so far. On the other hand, positive changes in such factors as financial support and organizational support for enterprises from the administration would be most likely to improve cooperation between sectors in respondents' opinion.","[Kobylinska, Urszula] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Kobylinska, U (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",u.kobylinska@pb.edu.pl,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education [S/WZ/3/2015],"Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The research have been carried out the framework of work S/WZ/3/2015 and founded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education,,21,1,1,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,222,231,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700023,0

However, extensive public debt raises interest rates, extrudes private investments, worsens fixed balance, widens short-term fluctuation and has a negative impact on economic growth. The performance of the economy can be measured mostly by GDP, which is expressed as the monetary value of all finished products and services produced in a certain time period in one country. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship, or rather identify the mutual correlation of public debt of one country and its performance (GDP). The research includes countries of the European Union, which have an identifiable timeline of public debt and GDP. The source of this data is the database of the World Bank. The information is from the period of years from 1995 through 2015. The correlation of the whole file of countries and then individual countries is ascertained.

The British East India Company (EIC) also faced strong resistance when the firm representatives threatened to jeopardize the royal court system of so-called Old Corruption and engaged in all sort of unethical activities for personal enrichment. In the end, all regulation attempts faded out and came to nothing. The EIC set standards in many areas, positive and negative. However, the political process step by step introduced laws, rules and regulations to ensure more transparent and controllable business practices. Considering just the current discussion on governance, the will to reliable rule of law and prosecute breaches of law in many areas and countries is still not very distinct despite corresponding legal frameworks. What impact has legacy on current organizational and individual behavior? And what needs to be done to change it? The hypothesis is that the Old is still present in the New, and we need to be aware of cultural influences on corporate behavior if we want to change it. Especially the CFA today wants to ensure ethical behavior of its members, but old habits often die hard.

The results provide supporting evidence for the role played by the human capital of domestic firms, i.e., the ratio of skilled, in realizing mainly horizontal spillovers.","[Ozer, Seda Koymen] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Boke, Selin Sayek] Grand Natl Assembly Turkey, Ataturk Blvd 153, TR-06543 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Turkiye Buyuk Millet Meclisi (TBMM); Grand National Assembly of Turkey,"Özer, SK (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.;Böke, SS (通讯作者)，Grand Natl Assembly Turkey, Ataturk Blvd 153, TR-06543 Ankara, Turkey.",skoymen@bilkent.edu.tr; selin.sayekboke@tbmm.gov.tr,,"Koymen Ozer, Seda/0000-0003-0937-5418",,,,,62,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Actually, this research is an attempt to overcome the identified disadvantages of the generic SERVQUAL instrument, and to develop a more reliable and more valid instrument for measuring retail banking service quality in Macedonia. For that purpose, the perceptions section of the SERVQUAL scale, i.e. SERVPERF scale was adapted and refined for measuring the functional aspects of service quality and the instrument proposed by Lassar et al. (2000) was used for measuring the technical aspects of service quality. New items in the inventory were added as a result of the conducted qualitative analysis, identifying the specific aspects of the industry and country context. Further, factor analysis was conducted for data reduction and for refining the generated inventory of items. The sample consisted of 208 private clients of banks in Macedonia. Inventory refinement resulted in a reliable and valid instrument for measuring Macedonian banking service quality, encompassing both functional and technical aspects of service quality. Additionally, the conducted analysis identified three dimensions of service quality in the banking sector of Macedonia: reliability/responsiveness, tangibles and price. The developed instrument would be of great importance in fulfilling the sectorial and cultural gap in understanding and measuring service quality. Additionally, this research would be of great managerial and academic importance as a basis for further research and measurement of service quality in the banking sector in Macedonia.","[Palamidovska-Sterjadovska, Nikolina] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ Skopje, Blvd Goce Delcev 9V, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Palamidovska-Sterjadovska, N (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ Skopje, Blvd Goce Delcev 9V, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia.",nikolina@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,,"Palamidovska-Sterjadovska, Nikolina/0000-0002-2926-5649",,,,,41,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,448,457,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700048,0

The aim of the paper is to provide food security in the lamb market in the EU, where there are shortages. The research period covered the time from 2005 to 2013. The sources of the materials include literature and data of FAPA and EUROSTAT. The study used descriptive, tabular and graphical methods and the Pearson linear correlation coefficient. It was found that the production of lamb meat in 2005-2013 decreased as volume of import and consumption per person decreased, while the share of self-supply increased. Security in quantitative terms, however, has improved. There was a significant positive correlation between the volume of production of lamb and beef and pork consumption (consumption of these meats fell). The consumption of lamb was affected by the economic situation in the EU and prosperity of its citizens. Similar situation was observed in the case of lamb imports.. Heavy lamb prices rose sharply and found a strong significant negative correlation with the volume of production of this type of meat in the EU, the consumption of lamb per person and imports of the lamb. Lamb has become a rare product; hence its price has increased. Lamb ensures food security, because it has valuable nutritional properties and health benefits.","[Rokicki, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Rokicki, T (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",tomasz_rokicki@sggw.pl,"Rokicki, Tomasz/GPT-2120-2022","Rokicki, Tomasz/0000-0003-3356-2643",,,,,27,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-261-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,45,,,,,344,350,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406530100042,0

Estimates show that a first-born son may provide economic advantages through a reduction in total children born and also from an adult son's labor supply contribution to his parents' household. The observed pattern of incentives is also compared with observed patterns in sex selection as a test of whether the relative economic value of first-born sons and daughters can explain the prevalence of sex-selective abortion.","[Rosenblum, Daniel] Dalhousie Univ, Econ, Dept Econ, POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Rosenblum, D (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Econ, Dept Econ, POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",Daniel.Rosenblum@dal.ca,,"Rosenblum, Daniel/0000-0003-0056-9734",,,,,36,5,5,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Most of the research and policy have been directed towards mitigation of irresponsible borrowing. Considering the disappointing results of such policies (ever growing number of over-indebted households), this research points to the neglected problem of irresponsible lending practices of the financial industry actors. This direction of research is additionally supported by previous research findings: consumers perceive banking sector as responsible for debt problem, and believe that they act unethically when promoting the easy access to credit. Responsible lending practices span across broad range of lenders' activities: from information disclosure in pre-contractual stage, creditworthiness assessment to impartial counseling in case of difficulties in repaying debt, just to name a few. This research is focused on the problem of adequate information provision to consumers through marketing activities of principal credit providers. Prior to the field research, desk research of the existing regulation on information disclosure in the advertisement stage of the consumer credit is carried out. The next method applied is content analysis of advertising tools in Croatian financial sector and comparison of the results within European Union. Analysis entails two aspects of advertising content compliance with national legislation and European consumer credit directive (CCD): first, quantity of information disclosed and second, quality of information disclosed. Due to the small credit market and scarce number of specialist lenders the analysis is contained to the banking sector which covers vast majority of consumer credit agreements. Results show that compliance of bank marketing efforts, both quantitative and qualitative, with the information requirements at the advertisement stage is extremely low. That gives evidence to the claim that banks engage in irresponsible lending practices and therefore show very low level of corporate social responsibility. Results also indicate that adequate supervision of the analyzed bank lending practices by responsible regulatory bodies is completely missing.","[Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunja; Dimitric, Mira] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Skalamera-Alilovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",dunja.skalamera-alilovic@efri.hr; mira.dimitric@efri.hr,"Dimitric, Mira/R-9274-2018; Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunja/R-6910-2018","Dimitric, Mira/0000-0001-6941-5392; Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunja/0000-0003-2346-154X",Croatian Science Foundation [6558],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project 6558 Business and Personal Insolvency: The Ways to Overcome Excessive Indebtedness.,,34,1,1,0,9,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,390,401,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000040,0

Numerous agents in corporate organizations thus face a conundrum of creativity versus branding, which is perhaps nowhere more pronounced than in the fashion business. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in a fashion company, I argue that these seemingly incompatible imperatives are inextricably entangled, as their paradoxical relation is solved, even dissolved, in a dynamic interplay between 'a totemic logic' and 'an animist practice'. Thus, a dynamics of totemism and animism unites creativity and branding in the continual pursuit of uniqueness. While totemic and animist modalities are most commonly associated with non-western ontologies and perceived as mutually exclusive, I contend that they are also at work in contemporary commercial processes and that they are enmeshed in, and propelled by, each other. This suggests that these modalities operate together particularly when the making of distinctive identities is critical - as in economic competition today.","[Vangkilde, Kasper Tang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anthropol, Sch Culture & Soc, Hojbjerg, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Vangkilde, KT (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Anthropol, Sch Culture & Soc, Hojbjerg, Denmark.",etnkvangkilde@cas.au.dk,,"Vangkilde, Kasper Tang/0000-0002-0971-2827",,,,,45,2,2,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In other word, sentiment analysis is applied for understanding of customer's opinions and attitudes expressed through review published (Misopoulos et al. 2014). This study was designed to apply sentiment analysis to evaluate the foreign tourists' satisfaction of Moscow, using Twitter data. Moscow was chosen for this study because of its rapid growth as tourist destination. As theoretical models for sentiment analysis of touristic destinations are rare the author proposed own theoretical model based on the performance only attributive approach. Five attributes were chosen for this study of tourist satisfaction while visiting Moscow namely: sightseeing, restaurants, night life, accommodation and transport. Totally through 5 attributes 676 tweets were gathered and the overall sentiment score was calculated. After sentiment analysis the tweets were manually read and the problems which the tourists face in Moscow during travelling were anticipated.

The problem with the desire to struggle over surplus is that Marxism contains no disenchanting, infraliminal moment within its analysis of the commodity and, without that infraliminal dimension, it is doomed to irrelevance as a theoretical constellation capable of moving beyond the commodity form because, while they renounce valorization and commodities, they do not necessarily renounce value and, while demonizing the capitalist class, have a romance for capital itself. It matters not if we ask a communist or a recovering communist, the only difference is timbre, not substance: Capitalism is something of a goose from the standpoint of abstract reason and the ideal of perfection.

Since non-traditional trademarks have received broad protection among WTO Members, the international registration of non-traditional trademarks has raised certain questions. This article focuses on issues of the registration of non-traditional trademarks from an international perspective. With a brief introduction to the new category of trademarks, Section 2 discusses whether non-traditional signs can constitute trademarks by analyzing the trademark definition that is stipulated in Article 15.1 of the TRIPS Agreement and introduces the current status of the legal protection afforded to non-traditional trademarks under the domestic trademark legislations in WTO Member states. Section 3 presents an in-depth analysis of Article 6quinquies of the Paris Convention and aims to address the significance of Article 6quinquies with regard to the international registration of non-traditional trademarks by comparing the essential difference between the two modes of international registration of trademarks. The conclusion provides strategical suggestions and practical guidance for both trademark applicants and competent authorities of WTO Members.","[Zhan, Qian] East China Normal Univ, Sch Law, Shanghai, Peoples R China",East China Normal University,"Zhan, Q (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Sch Law, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhanqian813@hotmail.com,"yang, xu/JMP-5558-2023",,Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [14YJC820071],"Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","The author gratefully acknowledges the insightful comments received from Professor Naigen Zhang, Professor Doris Long, and two anonymous reviewers of the WTR.

The Impact of College Class Size on Student Retention and Graduation,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; UNIVERSITY,"This paper measures the effects of collegiate class size on college retention and graduation. Class size is a perennial issue in research on primary and secondary schooling. Few researchers have focused on the causal impacts of collegiate class size, however. Whereas college students have greater choice of classes, selection problems and nonrandom sorting make it difficult to estimate causal impacts. Using unique data and exogenous variation in class size, we estimate the impacts of class size using a sample of nearly 60,000 four-year college students. Using an instrumental variables approach to control for selection bias, the results suggest an increase in collegiate class size leads to an increase in dropout rates and a reduction in on-time degree completion, but no change in long-run degree completion.","[Bettinger, Eric P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bettinger, Eric P.] NBER, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Long, Bridget Terry] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Long, Bridget Terry] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bettinger, EP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Bettinger, EP (通讯作者)，NBER, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ebettinger@stanford.edu; bridget_long@gse.harvard.edu,"Islam, Rakib/AGS-6833-2022","Bettinger, Eric P./0000-0002-0337-8223; Long, Bridget/0000-0003-2333-9245",Ohio Board of Regents,Ohio Board of Regents,"We are grateful for helpful comments from Eric Hanushek, Victor Lavy, David Figlio, and members of the NBER Education Group.

While conservatives and corporate interests use the crisis to weaken regulations, their opponent deny the existence of a science's crisis altogether. Thus, for the conservative National Association of Scholars NAS the crisis is real and due to the progressive assault on higher education with ideologies such as neo-Marxism, radical feminism, historicism, post-colonialism, deconstructionism, post-modernism, liberation theology. In the opposite field, some commentators claim that there is no crisis in science and that saying the opposite is irresponsible. These positions are to be seen in the context of the ongoing battle against regulation, of which the new rules proposed at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are but the last chapter. In this optic, Naomi Oreskes writes on Nature that what constitutes the crisis is the conservatives' attack on science. This evident right-left divide in the reading of the crisis is unhelpful and dangerous to the survival of science itself. An alternative reading ignored by the contendents would suggest that structural contradictions have emerged in modern science, and that addressing these should be the focus of our attention.","[Saltelli, Andrea] Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Bergen, Norway; [Saltelli, Andrea] UOC, Open Evidence Res, Barcelona, Spain",University of Bergen,"Saltelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Bergen, Norway.;Saltelli, A (通讯作者)，UOC, Open Evidence Res, Barcelona, Spain.",Andrea.saltelli@uib.no,"Saltelli, Andrea/M-8036-2019; Saltelli, Andrea/HTN-9746-2023","Saltelli, Andrea/0000-0003-4222-6975; Saltelli, Andrea/0000-0003-4222-6975",,,,,58,16,17,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,DEC,2018,104.0,,,,,,85,90,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.07.006,0.0,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,HD5RG,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452587000008,0

We relate the arguably exogenous daily variation in air pollution-instrumented by the occurrence of temperature inversion-with student illnesses and absences from more than 3000 schools in Guangzhou City. We find a sizable deleterious effect of air pollution on school attendance through the health channel. The impact persists for at least four days and displays a monotonically increasing pattern. Notably, this harmful effect is non-negligible even when pollution levels are below the official standards for air quality in China, suggesting that the current ambient air quality standards in China are not low enough to protect students.

We find that a 10% increase in the coal stockpiles held by US. power plants results in a 0.09% increase in average PM2.5 concentration levels within 25 miles of these plants. Unlike most sources of variation in local air pollution, coal storage and handling impacts PM2.5 but not other pollutants such as SO2 and NO2. Consequently, using coal stockpiles as an instrument, we show that a 10% increase in PM2.5 causes a 1.1% (3.2%) increase in average adult (infant) mortality rates. Using a value of statistical life approach, our estimates indicate that a one ton increase in coal stockpiles results in local air pollution costs of $197.

The framework is rooted in the notion of variety engineering (Beer, 1979, 1985; Espejo and Reyes, 2011). We introduce the concepts of complexity gradient, flow of complexity and complexity attractor as the main pillars of the proposed mechanism. The design of these complexity attractors implies entering the black-box description of the social system to understand its operational dynamics. We use the capabilities approach of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum (Sen, 1999; Nussbaum, 2000) to show how this mechanism can increase the inner complexity of the system to achieve desirable performance vis-a-vis its environment. We exemplify this mechanism by describing a pilot project that has been developed in a small municipality in Colombia regarding local capabilities building to increase its quality of life. The attractor of complexity connects higher education and innovation with local development.","[Reyes, Alfonso] Univ Los Andes, Carrera 1 Este 19A-40, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Reyes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Carrera 1 Este 19A-40, Bogota, Colombia.",areyes@uniandes.edu.co,,"reyes, alfonso/0000-0001-7247-7594",,,,,28,8,8,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,73,83,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.04.004,0.0,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900008,0

Despite their importance in the Togolese economy, informal sector workers (ISW) do not have a health insurance scheme. This paper aims to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of ISW in order to have access to Mandatory Health Insurance (MHI), and to analyze the main determinants of WTP. Methods: This study used data from the Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) project implemented in 2015 by the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP). It focusses on 4,296 ISW (2,374 in urban areas and 1,922 in rural areas, respectively). The contingent valuation method was used to determine the WTP for the MHI while the Tobit model is used to analyze its determinants. Results and discussion: Findings indicate that about 92% of ISW agreed to have access to MHI, like for formal sector workers. Overall, ISW are willing to pay 2,569 FCFA (USD 4.7) per month. ISW in the poorest quintiles are willing to allocate a higher proportion of their income (15%) to the premium than the richest quintiles (2.5%). Generally, women are more interested in MHI than men, although men are willing to pay higher premiums (3,168.9 FCFA or USD 5.8) than women (2,077 FCFA or USD 3.8). Women's lower WTP can be explained by their low levels of education and income, and a lack of employment opportunities compared to men. The gender of the head of the household, the size of the household and the education and income levels are the main determinants of WTP. Conclusion: We conclude that it is possible to extend MHI to ISW as long as their premiums are subsidized. The annual subsidy is estimated at 4.1% of the state current general budget or 96% of the health sector budget. In setting the premium, policy makers should take into account the MHI benefits package, subsidies from the government, and information about the WTP. It is important to emphasize that resource mobilization and management, as well as health services delivery, would be effective only in a context of improved governance.","[Djahini-Afawoubo, Dosse Mawussi; Atake, Esso-Hanam] Univ Lome Togo, Dept Econ Sci, Lome, West Africa, Togo",University of Lome,"Djahini-Afawoubo, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Lome Togo, Dept Econ Sci, Lome, West Africa, Togo.",dossedjahini@gmail.com,"Djahini-Afawoubo, dossè Mawussi/D-4108-2018","ATAKE, Esso - Hanam/0000-0003-4633-4615; DJAHINI-AFAWOUBO, Dosse Mawussi/0000-0003-0386-0033",,,,,37,8,8,0,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Our study examines the effects of one such statewide articulation and transfer policy, the Ohio transfer module (TM). This agreement is intended to allow individuals who successfully complete the TM at one institution to transfer all of these credits to a receiving institution. We find that students who complete the TM are more likely to transfer to a four-year institution and earn associate's degrees than observationally similar peers who did not complete a TM. We also find suggestive evidence that students who complete the TM are able to bring more credits with them when they transfer. However, students who complete the TM also take slightly longer to complete their bachelor's degrees. Thus, although the TM may improve the probability that students will transfer, it may be inefficient for students, leading them to spend more time enrolled in college. Moreover, because only a small number of students complete the TM, this policy may not be far-reaching enough to dramatically improve Ohio's community college transfer rate.","[Boatman, Angela; Soliz, Adela] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Organizat, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"Boatman, A (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Leadership Policy & Organizat, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",angela.boatman@vanderbilt.edu; adela.r.soliz@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,52,15,22,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Forestry is an important boreal industry; hence, it is necessary to better understand the ecological impacts that directly and indirectly affect this sector. We reviewed published literature concerning ecological impacts of climate change on biome shifts, regional forest disturbances, and tree growth, mortality and species compositional shifts in established forest stands. Subsequently, we examined how each factor influences timber supply and forestry. Tree species ranges have been and will continue migrating north to find more suitable growing conditions, but at a slower rate than climate change. Biome shifts from forests to shrub or grasslands may occur under persistent drought conditions. Warmer temperatures and lower climate moisture availability increase forest disturbances; notably fire and insect outbreaks, creating younger forests dominated by pioneer species and limiting harvestable material. While tree growth and mortality rates are spatially variable across established forest regions, tree mortality has temporally increased with climate change; accompanied by reduced growth or increased growth at a rate lower than mortality loss, resulting in a reduced rate of volume accumulation and timber available for harvest. Moreover, climate change favors pioneer species (Pinus spp. and Populus spp.) over late successional species (Picea spp. and Abies spp.). Our findings suggest that climate change has strong negative effects on boreal timber supply but may prompt operational adaptations, opening opportunities for forest industry to incorporate species such as Populus.","[Brecka, Aaron F.

Brazil has taken several steps to reduce emissions associated with deforestation including the development of policies to promote and reward cattle ranching intensification. Intensification practices are hypothesized to reduce the conversion of tropical forests while simultaneously increasing the productivity of ranching on current pasture lands. This paper assesses the impact of intensification on the demand for productive land. A theoretical model of land use, which considers the degree of intensification in the estimation of the derived demand for pasture, is tested with data from small-scale landowners who operate dairy farms and calving operations in the greater Ouro Preto do Oeste region of Rondonia. Results suggest different trajectories for beef and dairy production. The intensification of cattle production exhibits a nonlinear relationship with the demand for productive land: first as farms become more intensive the demand for newly cleared land increases, but then decreases with further intensification. The results are different for dairy intensification, which is found to be correlated with reduced deforestation. Findings suggest that the reliance on policies that promote intensification can be a risky way of achieving climate change objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This includes viewing states and government actors as predictors of compliance. Yet fine-grained studies on how the interplay of informal institutions and local actors' interests prevents standards being implemented are still lacking. Drawing on seven months of ethnographic fieldwork at the main supply center for sweatshop produced and counterfeit clothing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this article shows how these actors' tolerance toward the sweatshop economy obstructs the implementation of labor standards. According to empirical evidence, this tolerance means protecting certain actors, i.e. non-enforcing the law. Accordingly, the paper distinguishes between two types of protection: provided by state or by political actors. By uncovering the workings of informal institutions and the political actors' logics, this article helps to understand why deplorable labor conditions in the garment industry persist.","[Dewey, Matias] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Dewey, M (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany.",dewey@mpifg.de,,,Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies,Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies,This work was supported by the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies.,,74,10,10,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We exploit a natural experiment where university students have to write a research paper in business, economics, or law during their first year before they choose a major. Due to oversubscription of business papers, the field of the paper is assigned quasi-randomly. We find that writing in economics raises the probability of majoring in economics by 2.7 percentage points. We show further that this effect varies across subfields: the effect is driven by assignment to topics less typical of the public's perception of the field of economics, suggesting students learn through exposure that the field is broader than they thought.","[Fricke, Hans] Stanford Univ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Grogger, Jeffrey] Univ Chicago, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Steinmayr, Andreas] Univ Munich, Ludwigstr 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Fricke, Hans; Grogger, Jeffrey; Steinmayr, Andreas] IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Grogger, Jeffrey] NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Steinmayr, Andreas] IFW Kiel, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Stanford University; University of Chicago; University of Munich; IZA Institute Labor Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Fricke, H (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, 520 Galvez Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hfricke@stanford.edu; jgrogger@uchicago.edu; andreas.steinmayr@econ.lmu.de,"Steinmayr, Andreas/HLX-0802-2023; Steinmayr, Andreas/AAF-4741-2019","Steinmayr, Andreas/0000-0002-2491-5032",Swiss National Science Foundation [P2SGP1_155412]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [CRC TRR 190]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P2SGP1_155412] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),Andreas Steinmayr received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation through grant P2SGP1_155412 and from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through CRC TRR 190.,,31,19,25,4,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Wood, as an eco-friendly construction material, can play an important role in sustainable development. During past decades, the early modern and modern wooden structural industry in Japan has developed rapidly, compared with that in China; this difference is due to the distinct domestic situations of the two countries, which involve forest resources, timber imports and exports, forestry industrial development, government policies, and geographical factors. This study analyzed the modern wooden structure market at the consumer level in Japan and China, given their different market environments. The results show that Japanese consumers have a higher premium acceptance for modern wooden structure residences, whereas Chinese consumers are more willing to pay for modern wooden structure hotels. Several factors were examined as determinants of consumers' willingness to pay for modern wooden hotels and residences. The results indicate that, for modern wooden hotels, affection and prior experience influence both Japanese and Chinese consumers' willingness to pay price premiums, while education negatively impacts the likelihood of paying a premium for modern wooden structure hotels in China. For modern wooden residences, only affective factors increase the likelihood of paying a premium in both China and Japan; moreover, prior experience, positive knowledge, and household size have negative effects on it in China. Compared with cognitive and demographic factors, affective components influence consumers' willingness to pay for modern wooden structures strongly. These results help to provide a better understanding of the modern wooden structure market in Japan and China, and we offer suggestions to policy makers, developers and timber companies regarding modern wooden structure promotions.","[Luo, Wen; Mineo, Keito; Matsushita, Koji; Kanzaki, Mamoru] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan",Kyoto University,"Luo, W (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",wenluoicy@gmail.com,"Mineo, Keito/GQR-1363-2022","Luo, Wen/0000-0003-2451-7381",China Scholarship Council (CSC),China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This research was partly supported by Road Station Woody Keihoku by providing supports in data collection.

Negative effects were found for military affairs (specifically rogue actor violence) and AI. The net effect for surveillance was ambiguous. The effects for the environment, military affairs, and AI appear to be the largest, with the environment perhaps being the largest of these, suggesting that APM would be net beneficial to society.

A mathematical model comparing the efficacy and costs of posaconazole versus fluconazole was adapted to the Spanish National Healthcare System. Clinical data were obtained from the pivotal clinical trial of posaconazole oral suspension for allogeneic HSCT recipients, while pharmacological costs and use of resources were obtained from national sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA), as well as two alternative scenarios, were run to evaluate the robustness of the results under varying input values. Posaconazole tablets reduced the number of IFD events and enhanced overall survival, while maintaining a controlled budget. When compared to fluconazole, it was found to be a cost-effective alternative, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a,notsign13,193/life years gained. The PSA showed that posaconazole remained cost-effective in 74.6% of the cases, while alternatives scenarios yielded similar results as the base case.

However, there are a lack of credible investigations into the long-term returns on investment of afforestation inclusive of positive and negative externalities, project-related costs, and dynamic environmental feedbacks. Using the New York City forest canopy as an example, our integrated bioeconomic-health model illustrates that investments in afforestation produce per planted tree net benefits that are significantly lower than previous similarly comparable estimates ($12 vs. $172) and are nonlinear in canopy size. We also show that a reduction in urban air quality, such as those that may be produced by changes in national air quality policies and enforcement, can be mitigated through increased investment in urban afforestation.

We analyzed 130 Nepalese forest commons to determine how key forest collective action variables are associated with carbon storage. As expected, we find household participation in forest management and public audit have favorable implications for carbon storage. However, we also fad conservation duration, communities' ability to modify rules and existence of penalty system have constraining, and mutual trust have no or neutral implications for carbon storage. These findings indicate that better collective action does not necessarily store additional carbon. If forest commons in developing countries are to contribute to global climate change initiatives, such as the United Nation's program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +), our findings suggest the need for dedicated policies and programs to create additional incentives.","[Luintel, Harisharan; Bluffstone, Randall A.; Scheller, Robert M.] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA",Portland State University,"Luintel, H (通讯作者)，SmartStart Evaluat & Res, 4482 Barranca Pkwy,Suite 220, Irvine, CA 92604 USA.",hluintel@smartstart-er.com; bluffsto@pdx.edu; rschell@ncsu.edu,"Scheller, Robert/B-3135-2009","Scheller, Robert/0000-0002-7507-4499","The World Bank Group [7161880, 7176679]",The World Bank Group,"We would like to acknowledge the financial support of The World Bank Group (7161880 and 7176679).

Survey responses by more than 1,000 eligible voters to questions about how much public spending on road safety should increase are combined with observations of their income tax and road usage to derive the value of a statistical accident avoided. A risk-risk tradeoff elicitation allows decomposing this value into willingness to-pay values for various degrees of accident severity. Our most comprehensive estimate of the value per statistical life is CHF 4.2 million (corresponding to $4.5 million or E3.5 million). We explore the sensitivity of the elicitation approach to anchoring and other framing effects and find that our approach is as least as scope sensitive as other stated preference approaches.

However, these models still have important imperfections; adding information on (diagnoses of) physiotherapy treatment may further improve RE-models. Therefore, a new risk-adjuster based on physiotherapy costs in the prior year was introduced in the Dutch RE-model of 2016. Physiotherapy claims-data (2012) and administrative data on costs and risk-characteristics (2013) for 94% of the Dutch population (N = 15.8 million) are used to evaluate the current risk-adjuster based on physiotherapy costs and to assess the effects of replacing it by different modalities of a risk-adjuster based on physiotherapy diagnoses. Of the 89 diagnoses in the claims-data, 62 are dropped because they relate to temporary health problems. The 27 retained diagnoses are added to the Dutch model in 4 modalities: 27 separate risk-classes, 9 diagnosis-clusters based on main pathology category, 4 diagnosis-clusters based on residual costs, and the 4 clusters of modality 3 interacted with age. Although the cost-based risk-adjuster improves the model's predictive power and removes the average undercompensation (a,notsign919) for enrollees with physiotherapy costs in the prior year, it is outperformed by all 4 diagnosis-based modalities. Of these modalities, modality 3 is preferred based on its simplicity and comparable predictive power. Adding information on physiotherapy can further improve the performance of sophisticated RE-models. Regarding the Dutch model, a risk-adjuster containing 4 risk-classes for clustered diagnoses based on residual costs is the preferred modality.","[Eijkenaar, Frank; van Vliet, Rene C. J.

Existing estimates of the evolution of education returns in the region have not had a causal focus and observed patterns may be driven by changes in selection bias as educational attainment expanded from a privileged few to large masses of the population. This paper exploits three comparable education policy changes over more than two decades in Tunisia to estimate the effect of education on public sector employment for different cohorts born from the 1950s to the 1970s. I combine census and labor force surveys from 2004 to 2010 amounting to more than one million observations of relevant cohorts.

Several proxies for firm size are included in the analysis. We find that firm's share of total sales has a positive impact on profitability, while an alternative proxy, total assets, is negatively linked to profitability. Financial leverage (gearing) has a negative impact, but liquidity (current assets/current liabilities) is not found to significantly affect profitability. Operating efficiency indicators like working capital management (net working capital/total assets) and operating leverage (fixed assets/total assets) are positively associated with profitability. Finally, we find that salmon price variability increases profitability, and that smaller companies are more able to take advantage of the profit opportunities that price variability offer, compared to larger companies.","[Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, 1741 Museum Rd,183 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 1741 Museum Rd,183 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Sikveland, Marius; Zhang, Dengjun] Univ Stavanger, Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, 1741 Museum Rd,183 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 1741 Museum Rd,183 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",frank.asche@ufl.edu,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728","Norwegian Research Council [CT-233689, CT-267572]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"Financial support for the Norwegian Research Council (CT-233689, CT-267572) is acknowledged.",,56,42,43,3,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Using a VECM model, we examine the impact of FDI on the Romanian convergence index covering the period 2000-2013. The obtained results support a unidirectional short-run and long-run Granger causality that runs only from the FDI flows to the convergence index. In the long run a 1% increase of FDI flows would imply an estimated increase of almost 0.61% in the economic convergence index of Romania towards the EU-average. The IRF and the variance decomposition from VECM indicate a short-run positive relationship between FDI flows and the convergence index. The analysis leads to the finding that on the short-run a 1% increase in FDI/GDP contributes to an increase in the convergence index to EU-average by 1% over the next eight quarters.","[Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Labour Market Policy Dept, Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania; [Begu, Liviu Stelian; Apostu, Simona Andreea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Davidescu, AA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Labour Market Policy Dept, Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania.",adrianaalexandru@yahoo.com; liviu.begu@csie.ase.ro,"Apostu, Simona-Andreea/B-8099-2019","Apostu, Simona-Andreea/0000-0003-1727-0114",,,,,34,1,1,1,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This article traces the emergence and expansion of this more firm-specific skills provision system, which diminishes the beneficial constraints for strategic cooperation and, in turn, the provision of collective training standards and transferable skills. The case study builds on the 'gradual institutional change' taxonomy, while pointing to the potential benefits of using different modes of change in combination. Through analysing firms' strategies to initiate change in an institutional grey area between established socio-economic spheres, the article shows how layering, conversion and drift can become interlinked and how each individual process can trigger and feed the next.","[Graf, Lukas] Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Graf, L (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",lukas.graf@unisg.ch,"Graf, Lukas/AAO-5940-2020","Graf, Lukas/0000-0002-1447-4165",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SO 430/5-1]; American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (DAAD research fellowship),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (DAAD research fellowship),This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SO 430/5-1] and the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (DAAD research fellowship).,,68,29,29,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Three figures of the consumer appeared along with the evolving design of the smart home and meter: a behavioural energy saver; a market offer chooser, and an attached consumer. The 'unbundling' doctrine, which states that competition must be sorted out from monopoly in order for the electricity market to function, was often invoked to justify changes in the smart meter and smart home designs. The role of the doctrine was, however, ambiguous. As a rather abstract perspective on the working of markets, unbundling seems to be exceeded by concrete and mundane marketing attempts at re-bundling choice. And yet consumer figures doctrinally compatible with classical/neoliberal economics, which considers the consumer to be an autonomous self, leave open the ground for an attached consumer to emerge, suggesting that the consumer is in fact always 'attached' rather than detached.","[Grandclement, Catherine] EDF R&D, Paris, France; [Nadai, Alain] CNRS, CIRED, Paris, France",Electricite de France (EDF); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Grandclément, C (通讯作者)，EDF R&D, Paris, France.",catherine.grandclement@gmail.com,,"alain, nadai/0000-0003-0383-2729; Grandclement, Catherine/0000-0003-0287-4425","French National Research Agency (ANR, Programme societes innovantes) [2011-SOIN-003-01]","French National Research Agency (ANR, Programme societes innovantes)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This work was carried out with the financial support of the French National Research Agency (ANR, Programme societes innovantes, convention 2011-SOIN-003-01, projet COLLENER).

J,"Guan, WW",,,,"Guan, Wenwei",,,Copyright Anti-Circumvention & Free Trade,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The article examines the contrasting implementation of Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Internet Treaties' anti-circumvention obligation and its free trade implications. While the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)'s implementation established a brand new exclusive right of access control for rightholders, the EU's InfoSoc Directive attempted to balance rightholder's access control with interests of fair use beneficiaries. Examination of copyright's private right nature shows access control in anti-circumvention finds no support from traditional theory, and actually turns copyright into a negative right in rem. Further examination on copyright limitations and exceptions shows that the anti-circumvention mechanism sits right at the centre of the dynamics between the idea-expression dichotomy, and the tension between rights and obligations. Critical examination of the circumstances of treaty conclusion of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Internet Treaties respectively shows that neither framework's settlements have successfully balanced rights and obligations, or private rights and public access. New development of regional trade fragmentation from Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), brings the anti-circumvention diversity further into a terrain of uncertainty. The article concludes with a call for attention to access control's negative impact on public information access and the balance of rights and obligations.","[Guan, Wenwei] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Guan, WW (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",w.guan@cityu.edu.hk,,,Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong [7004990],Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong,This research was partially supported by a Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong (Project No.: 7004990).

However, the noise trading of inexperienced investors in the Chinese stock market negatively affects market efficiency. By employing propensity score matching and multivariate regression analysis, we show that the increased individual investor participation actually lowers market efficiency in their home market after cross-listing. This effect is more evident for stocks that were either listed first on the Chinese stock market or listed on the Chinese stock market and the Hong Kong stock exchange (SEHK) on the same date than for stocks that were listed first on the SEHK.","[Hu, Yingyi] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Tiao] Invesco Capital Management, Houston, TX USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Hu, YY (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",huyingyi@icfs.swufe.edu.cn,,"HU, Yingyi/0000-0003-0151-476X",Humanity and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China [10YJC790087],"Humanity and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",Yingyi Hu acknowledges financial support from the Humanity and Social Science Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (approval number 10YJC790087).

Adapting to the Regulation entails several obligations that any data processor must abide by. Respecting these obligations is a challenge that implies several changes to the corporate structure and internal policies and procedures. Protecting personal data is a costly affair and erroneous implementation of procedures, that leads to data leaks, can be harshly sanctioned. Given the large definition of personal data, maintained by the Regulation, it can be assumed that, even if a company does not directly process information of personal nature, it will encounter, at some points in its activity, incidental forms of data processing. For example, even if a firm's lucrative revenue can mainly be attributed to buying and reselling engross, the company will still process user data on its website. There are several steps that any data processor must comply with. These include a preliminary audit for assessing the quality of current data handling procedures. In this sense, data controllers that already had procedures in place to enforce the legal obligations imposed by the Directive 95/46/CE will be in a privileged position. However, market surveys show that very few processors have actually done so. Given that any real implementation of the GDPR is dependent upon a proper preliminary audit, this study will analyze the proper manner in which such an audit must be conducted. Erroneous preliminary assessments will inevitably lead to future violations of the Regulation. Secondly, after the initial assessment, internal procedures for data handling must be put into place. Clear codification is essential in this process. The processor must ensure that all employees that handle personal information of clients and commercial partners are well trained and able to understand exactly what they must do. Moreover, the procedures should not be limited to mere day to day tasks. Crisis scenarios must be addressed, as this can first of all limit the potential damage and ensure that the subjects of data processing are properly informed, in accordance with recital 85 of the GDPR.","[Ioan, George-Cristian] Babes Bolyai Univ, 7 Sindicatelor St, Cluj Napoca 400029, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Ioan, GC (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, 7 Sindicatelor St, Cluj Napoca 400029, Romania.",georgecristianioan@gmail.com,,,Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj Napoca's program of scholarships,Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj Napoca's program of scholarships,This study is part of Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj Napoca's program of scholarships for student researchers.,,18,0,0,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,970,978,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200082,0

The variable, however, defining preferential credits for agriculture appeared only in two out of nine models constructed and with a negative sign. This concerned small and medium-sized cooperative banks. For large cooperative banks, preferential credit for agriculture were not of key importance in generating net profit.

Furthermore, the purpose of the paper is to draw conclusions for Polish companies interested in taking business activities in Indian market, basing exactly on dimensions. Poland and India differ significantly in many aspects. The crucial differences relay to hierarchy perception, individualistic versus collectivist approach or the degree of uncertainty avoidance. Although both countries exhibit high level of Power Distance, in India there is much more respect for hierarchy. Poles as individualistic culture, may be surprised with the strong group, family in particular, orientation and influence on individual's decisions. Indians seem to be much more relaxed than Poles, not everything has to go according to the plan or schedule. Patience and long-term relations are important. All these differences are visible in negotiation process, project management and implementation, everyday cooperation and subordinate/superior relations.","[Kuzminska-Haberla, Aleksandra] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Mkt, Dept Mkt Management, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Kuzminska-Haberla, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Mkt, Dept Mkt Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",aleksandra.kuzminska@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,27,0,0,2,17,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,267,283,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_17,0.0,,,17,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500017,0

Stochastic simulations of the model suggest that fish price increases by between 0.25 and 1.07% for each 1% increase in world income, and by between 0.30 and 1.20% for each 1% increase in world population. Combining these elasticity estimates with the actual growth in income and population for 1999-2013, results suggest that income and population growth together caused the world price of fish to rise by between 1.0 and 4.1% per year, for a best-bet estimate of 2.1% per year. According to a trend regression the actual rise in fish price over the same approximate period averaged 1.0% per year. This suggests supply growth due to aquaculture cut the increase in price due to demand shifts by about one half. Higher fish prices increase welfare in net-exporting countries at the expense of welfare in net-importing countries. However, our results suggest that net gains to producers and consumers in the two regions combined are positive.","[Ly Nguyen; Kinnucan, Henry W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Nguyen, L (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",ltn0002@auburn.edu,"Nguyen, Ly/AAO-1022-2021; Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224; Nguyen, Ly/0000-0002-3021-534X",,,,,47,7,8,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

To test this hypothesis, EU education policy objectives are described and the methods used in implementing them are presented. This is followed by an analysis of the level of public spending on education in the selected EU countries along with the degree to which European benchmarks have been achieved by individual countries. Statistical methods are used to analyze the correlation between the data. The study found that the variation in the level of spending on education is reflected in the degree to which the individual EU countries have achieved the benchmarks. In addition, the results of research support the conclusion that the degree to which the objectives have been achieved is also determined by objective factors. These include the structure of the education system, management methods, constitutional frames, and by political factors under state policy (reforms implemented, amendments to legal provisions).

Research has shown that institutional solutions have inspired horticulturists to join producer groups//organisations, resulting in an increase in the number of products offered on the domestic and international market. The strength of the correlation analysed between the number of producer groups/organisations and the selected characteristics of the fruit and vegetable market showed that integrated producers have a greater impact on the vegetable market than fruit. This impact had the properties of industrial agriculture. The structure of Polish groups/organisations in terms of their number allows us to suppose that, as small, often family businesses, they have premises to implement the paradigm of sustainable agriculture using the dual model.

We follow James' suggestion to not attribute intrinsic properties to hypotheses, but rather investigate how they came into being and look at the effects they generate. Expectations of digital technologies are a topic of vivid debate in the insurance industry. Before these expectations can become 'live', they have, in the first place, to be generated by market devices. We investigate how the reinsurance blogpost platform Open Minds functions as an 'expectation generation device' on the future of insurance markets. Combining Beckert's work on the role of fictional expectations with the pragmatist turn in sociology of markets, we propose to study 'expectation generation devices', provoking expectations on economic markets. In our empirical analysis, we demonstrate the explicit fictional character of the Open Minds contributions, and analyse how a contained space of openness is generated to provoke expectations. We demonstrate how Open Minds can become live through circulation to other expectation generation sites in the insurance industry and beyond. We conclude by reflecting on the importance of expectation generation devices as a particular type of market devices.","[Meyers, Gert; Van Hoyweghen, Ine] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res, Life Sci & Soc Lab, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Meyers, G (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res, Life Sci & Soc Lab, Parkstr 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",gert.meyers@kuleuven.be,"Van Hoyweghen, Ine/ABC-8853-2020","Van Hoyweghen, Ine/0000-0002-9402-2918; Meyers, Gert/0000-0002-5255-529X","Odysseus project 'Postgenomic Solidarity.

Road transport occupies the leading role in the entire transport by land in almost all countries of Union, and Republiic of Croatia is not an exception. The purpose of this paper was to underline basic characteristics of road freight market in the Republic of Croatia. It is a highly fragmented industry and due to that there is no company which could significantly influence the industry's profitability, as it is consisted of a large number of small companies. Most Croatian transporting companies have small vehicle fleets (up to 5 vehicles) with a poor average age structure. It is necessary to encourage alliances between Croatian road freight transportation companies, through clusters or associations, in order to operate together internationally and domestically. Despite the fact that in the Republic of Croatia, a few clusters have been operating for years now, their role is still marginal. Main problem is that most of Croatian road transporters are still not aware how alliances would influence their operations and make business dealings easier and more successful, both on the domestic and international market.","[Naletina, Dora] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Naletina, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",dora.naletina@efzg.hr,"Naletina, Dora/AAX-3207-2020","Naletina, Dora/0000-0002-6275-7039",,,,,30,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,699,709,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300078,0

The hotel industry is complex with particular reasons and opens up new frontiers in research on customer satisfaction. Respectively, customer service is the hotel industry's backbone that is used to be actual concept of industry itself. No matter the hotel businesses are big or not, a strong service-based philosophy is extremely importance to achieve business success level. The receipt of success in fostering high service quality of luxury hotel is to exhibit to customer that the hotel is serving the best facility they could offer by the best employee performance achievement through the most breathtaking views ever. For most people, hotel or hospitality service means entertaining guests with courtesy and warm, e.g the front desk is the hub of any guest transactions in a hotel to generate customers' problem-free at the beginning and end of cycle of services; housekeeping service is a vital and integral part of guest experience and satisfaction to being good infection prevention, healthy hygiene and cleanliness for guests, staff and visitors; security staffs maintain, safety and protective feeling for any individuals in a hotel, etc. The impact of these functions should not be under-estimated, but well collaboration and intercommunication to treat in-house guests such a family to absorb the feeling of home-away-from home. Therefore, the hotel' service quality especially in room division service is critical in shaping guest' pleasant memories of their stay. Different types of visitor segment regard to customer life cycle have various types of factors in a growth stage, and they unify to performance factors when the products and services mature. The diversity of guest market segments and booking channels have been charged by dynamic price strategy of hotel revenue management to maximize average room rate and occupancy percentage. The main objective of this study is to draw a theoretical framing of elements towards customer satisfaction and brand loyalty on the luxury hotel sector including guest online reviews, rate strategy and hotel website toward customer engagement behaviors through the process of perceived service quality. By integrating multiple marketing effort on brand attitude and customer focused, the multiple levels of customer satisfaction is related to perceptions of guests in order to be very affected in tourist arrivals and competitive performance of contemporary hotel industry.

Erasmus+, as a programme whose aim is to enable the youth mobility, is the best example of the EU initiative for the international cooperation. In fact, Erasmus+ is being focused on exchanges and mobility that have a positive effect on quality development of the work within young people, on strengthening of the higher education quality and on the inclusion of youth in the international business sector.

The research identified four groups of countries distinguished by the criterion of their policy resiliency and sustainability. Resiliency is understood as an energy policy which balances energy flows in an economy without increasing ecological deficit. Sustainability defines countries with demand for energy within an ecological limit of an economy. The most expansive economies increased their ecological deficit, regardless of the advances in some areas of their national energy strategies. Nevertheless, the success of the European Union is mostly defined by the economies which are decreasing their ecological deficit compared to their levels in 1990.

Backcasting is one form of scenario building where a normative view is taken about desirable futures, and the method then investigates different policy packages that can be used to reach those futures and the alternative pathways that can be followed. Where most difficulties have arisen in the past has been in bridging the conceptual elegance of the approach with the practicalities of implementation. Collaborative back casting bridges this 'implementation gap' through a participatory approach in which different stakeholders take an active role in building scenarios, in identifying policy measures and packages, and in evaluating different pathways. Using the region of Andalusia (Spain), this paper brings together the different strands of this collaborative methodology where a set of alternative transport futures have been considered, together with the means to achieve a sustainable transport system for 2050. It discusses eight issues: (i) the selection of participants; (ii) the combination of participatory techniques; (iii) the development of learning processes; (iv) the need for and role of mediators; (v) the diversity of transport futures and integration of policy pathways; (vi) the timeline and future horizons; (vii) the acceptability of different pathways; and (viii) the legal and institutional constraints to effective implementation.

Variability in catch by purse seine vessels and fluctuations in the auctioned volume at Tsukiji Market are used as supply shocks. This study finds an elastic demand for Pacific bluefin tuna with an estimated constant own-price elasticity of demand of -2.631. There is a growing concern for the health of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock, and management measures are being discussed. This estimation of own-price elasticity of demand for Pacific bluefin tuna can contribute to future policy evaluations. Under elastic demand, a price increase is met with more than a proportionate decrease in the quantity demanded. This may pose as a challenge to the Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries.","[Tokunaga, Kanae] Univ Tokyo, Ocean Alliance, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Tokunaga, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Ocean Alliance, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",katokunaga@oa.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Tokunaga, Kanae/0000-0002-6171-5187",Nippon Foundation,Nippon Foundation(Nippon Foundation),"This study was completed as part of the project, Science on Consensus Building Methods Related to Ocean Use, at the University of Tokyo-Ocean Alliance.

However, causalities between these two variables are ambiguous. The purpose of this paper is to investigate Granger causality between trade openness and financial development in 11 new EU member states. The annual data for the period 1995-2016 comes from WDI database. Openness is measured as the ratio of country's total trade (exports plus imports) to the country's GDP, or of exports to GDP, and of imports to GDP, separately. Financial development is proxied by domestic credit to private sector and domestic credit provided by financial sector (both measures as a percentage of GDP). The results show statistically significant causalities running from trade openness to financial development in half of the analysed countries with the estimated coefficients being negative. In the majority of countries, the linkages from finance to trade were statistically insignificant regardless the proxies considered. The empirical findings are related to theoretical arguments, both traditional and new ones, formulated mainly in the post-crisis era. We find the obtained results consistent with the empirical work of Bordo and Rousseau (2012), who found that finance and trade reinforced each other before 1930, but these effects do not persist after the Second World War. While Bordo and Rousseau analysed the OECD countries, our paper contributes to the finance-trade nexus literature by focusing on emerging markets.","[Wajda-Lichy, Marta; Kawa, Pawel] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Fijorek, Kamil; Denkowska, Sabina] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Wajda-Lichy, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Ul Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",wajdam@uek.krakow.pl; kawap@uek.krakow.pl; kamil.fijorek@uek.krakow.pl; denkowss@uek.krakow.pl,"Kawa, Paweł/AAY-6907-2021; Fijorek, Kamil/T-3008-2018","Fijorek, Kamil/0000-0003-1262-6425; Denkowska, Sabina/0000-0003-4663-8010",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,553,562,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.56,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700056,0

Evidence of cholera economic costs on affected households has been limited. This study aimed at determining economic costs on households affected by the cholera outbreak in a Coastal Region of Ghana. Methods: Two districts; High and Low Incidence Areas (HIA and LIA) were selected in comparative cost analysis and disease impact on affected households assessed based on scientifically documented economic indicators. A total of 418 (282 HIA and 136 LIA) households that experienced at least one case of cholera infection were interviewed. Direct and indirect costs were estimated. Correlates of household's cholera infection were estimated using Tobit Regression model in STATA 13. Results: Average direct cost to households in HIA amounted to USD 106.88, almost 2 folds higher than LIA (USD 62.02). Potential cost saving of an episode of cholera is USD 99,201.28 in LIA and raises almost 8 folds in HIA (USD 782,611.60). Households in lowest income category had the highest incidence of cholera (0.073) compared to other categories plus other factors were significant in explaining cholera incidence. Conclusions: The study showed considerable differences in HIA and LIA costs with higher household economic impact of cholera on the lowest income category. Results underscore the need for pragmatic policy interventions to avert recurrent outbreaks and emphasis huge potential cost saving with reducing cholera cases.","[Awalime, Dziedzom Kwesi; Owoo, Nkechi S.; Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward] Univ Ghana, Econ Dept, POB LG 25, Accra, Ghana; [Awalime, Dziedzom Kwesi; Davies-Teye, Bernard Bright K.; Vanotoo, Linda A.] Ghana Hlth Serv, Reg Hlth Directorate, POB 184, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana; Ghana Health Service,"Awalime, DK (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Econ Dept, POB LG 25, Accra, Ghana.;Awalime, DK (通讯作者)，Ghana Hlth Serv, Reg Hlth Directorate, POB 184, Accra, Ghana.",dawalime@gmail.com,"Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/S-9239-2019","Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/0000-0002-9754-1983; Owoo, Nkechi/0000-0002-5220-9733",Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research; Post-Doctoral Office,Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research; Post-Doctoral Office,Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research; Post-Doctoral Office.,,19,5,5,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Medication review with follow-up (MRF) is a professional pharmacy service aimed at improving patient's health outcomes through an optimization of the medication. To ascertain the economic impact of the MRF service provided in community pharmacies to aged polypharmacy patients comparing MRF with usual care, by undertaking a cost analysis and a cost-benefit analysis. The economic evaluation was based on a cluster randomized controlled trial. Patients in the intervention group (IG) received the MRF service and the comparison group (CG) received usual care. The analysis was conducted from the national health system (NHS) perspective over 6 months. Direct medical costs were included and expressed in euros at 2014 prices. Health benefits were estimated by assigning a monetary value to the quality-adjusted life years. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis was undertaken in order to analyse the uncertainty. The analysis included 1403 patients (IG: n = 688 vs CG: n = 715). The cost analysis showed that the MRF saved 97 a,notsign per patient in 6 months. Extrapolating data to 1 year and assuming a fee for service of 22 a,notsign per patient-month, the estimated savings were 273 a,notsign per patient-year. The cost-benefit ratio revealed that for every 1 a,notsign invested in MRF, a benefit of 3.3 a,notsign to 6.2 a,notsign was obtained. The MRF provided health benefits to patients and substantial cost savings to the NHS. Investment in this service would represent an efficient use of healthcare resources.","[Malet-Larrea, Amaia; Calvo, Begona] Univ Basque Country, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, P Univ 7, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Goyenechea, Estibaliz] Official Pharmacist Assoc Guipuzcoa, Prim 2, San Sebastian 20006, Spain; [Gastelurrutia, Miguel A.; Noain, Aranzazu; Martinez-Martinez, Fernando; Sabater-Hernandez, Daniel] Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, Pharmaceut Care Res Grp, Campus Univ Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria; Sabater-Hernandez, Daniel; Benrimoj, Shalom I.] Univ Technol Sydney, Grad Sch Hlth, 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Cabases, Juan M.] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia, Pamplona 31006, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Granada; University of Technology Sydney; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Malet-Larrea, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Technol, P Univ 7, Vitoria 01006, Spain.",amaia.malet@ehu.eus,"Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria/B-7456-2013; Calvo, Begoña/F-4091-2011","Garcia-Cardenas, Victoria/0000-0003-3770-4557; Benrimoj, Shalom (charlie)/0000-0001-9768-7838; ESTIBALIZ, GOYENECHEA/0000-0001-7990-5192; Cabases, Juan M/0000-0003-0207-4137; Sabater-Hernandez, Daniel/0000-0001-7419-8740; Gastelurrutia Garralda, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-1019-0234","Spanish General Council of Official Colleges of Pharmacists; CINFA Laboratory; Department of Education, Culture and Language Policy of the Basque Government through its Pre-doctoral Fellowship for Research Personnel in Training","Spanish General Council of Official Colleges of Pharmacists; CINFA Laboratory; Department of Education, Culture and Language Policy of the Basque Government through its Pre-doctoral Fellowship for Research Personnel in Training","We also acknowledge the financial support of the Spanish General Council of Official Colleges of Pharmacists and of CINFA Laboratory.; Amaia Malet-Larrea acknowledges the financial support of the Department of Education, Culture and Language Policy of the Basque Government through its Pre-doctoral Fellowship for Research Personnel in Training.",,48,33,34,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Some resource management taboos have lost their influence on practice in contemporary local communities. Nevertheless, others have survived societal transformation and continue to influence practice. Based on qualitative study of forest and wildlife taboos, farmland taboos, and water taboos in three Ghanaian communities employing the concept of institutional compliance, the paper explores explanations. The findings indicate that due to the adoption of Christianity and other aspects of modernity such as formal education and exposure to foreign culture through modern media, taboos that rely on myths only to achieve compliance have lost their influence on resource use practice in contemporary local communities. To retain their influence on resource use practice in contemporary local communities, resource management taboos need to have instrumental relevance in addition to their mythical relevance.","[Osei-Tutu, Paul] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Social Forestry, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Osei-Tutu, P (通讯作者)，Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Social Forestry, Kumasi, Ghana.",posei-tutu@knust.edu.gh,,"Osei-Tutu, Paul/0000-0002-3950-0470",Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD),Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The article was written from data collected for my PhD study on 'local forest management institutions in Ghana'.

Such collective contracting may be well suited to settings with communal land tenure or decision-making. Given that collective contracting does not require costly individual-level information on outcomes, it may also facilitate conditioning on additionality (i.e., conditioning payments upon clearly improved outcomes relative to baseline). Yet collective contracting often suffers from free riding, which undermines group outcomes and may be exacerbated or ameliorated by PES designs. We study impacts of conditioning on additionality within a number of collective PES designs. We use a framed field-laboratory experiment with participants from a new PES program in Mexico. Because social interactions are critical within collective processes, we assess the impacts from conditioning on additionality given: (1) group participation in contract design, and (2) a group coordination mechanism. Conditioning on above-baseline outcomes raised contributions, particularly among initially lower contributors. Group participation in contract design increased impact, as did the coordination mechanism. (c) 2017 The Authors.

We empirically test whether these costs affect production in schools - a hypothesis that follows directly from economic theory on labor frictions - using geocoded data on school locations and state boundaries. We find that achievement is lower in mathematics, and to a lesser extent in reading, at schools that are more exposed to state boundaries. A detailed investigation of the selection of schools into boundary regions yields no indication of systematic differences between boundary and non-boundary schools along other measured dimensions. Moreover, we show that cross-district labor frictions do not explain state boundary effects. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that mobility frictions in educator labor markets near state boundaries lower student achievement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine whether REDD+ payments enhance participation of households in forest conservation, benefit provision, policy making, community services and capacity building programs in community forests of Nepal. Our results show that socio-economic factors such as education, family size, agricultural land holdings, and biophysical factors such as distance from respondent's household to the affiliated community forest are more likely to determine the participation in community forest management rather than economic incentive provided by the REDD+ pilot project.

Often the purpose of the regulated health care system is to encourage providers to keep costs down without skimping on quality. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effect of price regulation and free choice on quality in physiotherapy organised by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland for the disabled individuals. We use the difference-in-differences method in our effort to isolate the effect of the regulation and for this task we have defined the regulated and non-regulated firms and their quality before and after the regulation. The variables needed in the econometric modelling were collected from several registers as well as by carrying out questionnaires on the firms. We show that price regulation decreased quality in physiotherapy statistically significantly and the mechanism was unable to incentivise firms to invest in quality. Most likely, our results are caused by cost reduction associated with price regulation. It seems that cost reduction was carried out through quality reductions in physiotherapy instead of increasing productivity.

In this paper, a comparative analysis on the impact of health expenditure between countries in the CEMAC sub-region and five other African countries that achieved the Abuja declaration is provided. Data for this study was extracted from the World Development Indicators (2016) database, panel ordinary least square (OLS), fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) were used as econometric technic of analysis. Results showed that health expenditure has a positive and significant effect on economic growth in both samples. A unit change in health expenditure can potentially increase GDP per capita by 0.38 and 0.3 units for the five other African countries that achieve the Abuja target and for CEMAC countries respectively, a significant difference of 0.08 units among the two samples. In addition, a long-run relationship also exist between health expenditure and economic growth for both groups of countries. Thus African Economies are strongly advised to achieve the Abuja target especially when other socio-economic and political factors are efficient.","[Piabuo, Serge Mandiefe; Tieguhong, Julius Chupezi] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Yaounde, Cameroon",,"Piabuo, SM (通讯作者)，World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Yaounde, Cameroon.",P.Mandiefe@cgiar.org,"Mandiefe, Piabuo Serge/AAG-7012-2019","Mandiefe, Piabuo Serge/0000-0001-8263-7985","Technical Training Research Centre for Development (TTRECED-Cameroon), TTRECED","Technical Training Research Centre for Development (TTRECED-Cameroon), TTRECED","Funding for this paper was provided by the Technical Training Research Centre for Development (TTRECED-Cameroon), TTRECED provided funds for all aspects of the paper.",,56,74,78,0,21,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

While rural communities and indigenous peoples make a significant contribution to the preservation of the Earth System along the mitigation pathway proposed by Steffen et al. (2007), their access rights to community and ancestral forestland are contested. Climate change, technological innovation, rising commodity prices and neoliberal deregulation have paved the way for an acceleration of the processes of land-grabbing and accumulation by dispossession (Harvey, 2003, 2004). The struggle of three Argentine wichi indigenous communities in the Salta province of Argentina illuminates the situation of many peasant and indigenous peoples in Latin America, confronting powerful transnational businesses that dispute access to their land and possession of natural resources. Fragile institutions fail to enforce communities' rights that have been recognized by international and national regulations, thus perpetuating inequities and exclusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that green card farm workers tend to allocate fewer workweeks to farm employment than citizens and undocumented workers, in favour of better opportunities in the non-farm sector. There is evidence of an assimilation effect, whereby undocumented workers also tend to re-allocate their time from farm to non-farm employment as their residence tenure increases, even though they experience constrained mobility and visibility during periods of strict immigration control. In the context of employers' violations of the existing labour laws that currently protect even the rights of undocumented workers, such turnover decisions seem justified. The findings raise concerns about whether any governmental effort to legalise the immigration status of such workers would reduce farm job turnover rates and increase farm employment retention, so long as labour standards are not enforced. Moreover, external economic shocks could more easily induce citizen and green card farm workers to abandon farm employment, whereas undocumented workers tend to remain in their farm jobs during such difficult times.","[Luo, Tianyuan; Escalante, Cesar L.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Escalante, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Agr & Appl Econ, 313 E Conner Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",cescalan@uga.edu,"Escalante, Cesar/GLV-6777-2022","Escalante, Cesar/0000-0002-0789-8330",,,,,38,9,10,2,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This population-based cohort study is based on the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966, which is a longitudinal research program in Finland's two northernmost provinces. The study is based on data collected at the 46-year follow-up, during which a total of 4997 individuals completed questionnaires on their primary health care service utilisation. Primary health care covered visits to both occupational and public health care (typically community health centres). Current smokers visited primary health care professionals more often per year than never-smokers, regardless of gender (RR 1.24, 95 % confidence interval 1.10-1.43 for men; RR 1.10, 1.01-1.22 for women). When primary health care services were categorised based on the type of service provided, current smokers of both genders were more likely to visit a dentist (RR 1.56, 1.32-1.84 for men; RR 1.34, 1.15-1.55 for women) or a physician (RR 1.20, 1. 03-1.40 for men; RR 1.15, 1.02-1.30 for women) than their never-smoking counterparts (BMI adjusted for). For men, the total annual costs of primary health care visits were 28 % higher for current smokers versus never-smokers (P < 0.001). For women, the difference was 21 % (P < 0.01). Smokers visit primary health care professionals more often already at the age of 46, before the expected diagnosis of fatal smoking-related illnesses. This phenomenon not only predicts an elevated incidence of serious illnesses in later life (such as cardiovascular disease), but also causes an economic burden on the health care system.","[Keto, Jaana; Jokelainen, Jari; Timonen, Markku; Ylisaukko-oja, Tero; Keinanen-Kiukaanniemi, Sirkka; Auvinen, Juha] Univ Oulu, Fac Med, Ctr Life Course Hlth Res, POB 5000, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Ventola, Hanna] Univ Helsinki, Dept Pharmacol, Inst Biomed, Haartmaninkatu 8, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Linden, Kari] Pfizer Oy, Tietokuja 4, Helsinki 00330, Finland",University of Oulu; University of Helsinki; Pfizer,"Keto, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Fac Med, Ctr Life Course Hlth Res, POB 5000, Oulu 90014, Finland.",jaana.keto@helsinki.fi,,"Jokelainen, Jari/0000-0003-4629-0560","Pfizer Oy Finland; Academy of Finland; University Hospital Oulu; University of Oulu, Finland; ERDF European Regional Development Fund-Well-being and health: Research in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort [539/2010 A31592]","Pfizer Oy Finland; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); University Hospital Oulu; University of Oulu, Finland; ERDF European Regional Development Fund-Well-being and health: Research in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort","This study was sponsored by Pfizer Oy Finland.

Using a sample of tenth grade students from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, I jointly estimate the dropout and participation decisions (including extracurricular offerings per student), and eligibility requirements as instruments for extracurricular participation. I include an interaction between the participation and at-risk indicators in the dropout equation because past disadvantages may differentially affect at-risk students. I also estimate alternative specifications to identify the effect of participation in different types of activities. Local average treatment effect estimates range from 14 to 20 percentage points, indicating that participants are significantly less likely to drop out of high school than they would have been if unable to participate, with similar estimates for both at-risk and not-at-risk students. These findings are relevant to policy makers and administrators seeking to increase high school graduation rates and improve educational outcomes.","[Crispin, Laura M.] St Josephs Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA",Saint Joseph's University,"Crispin, LM (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",lcrispin@sju.edu,,,Saint Joseph's University,Saint Joseph's University,"Many thanks to Audrey Light, Bruce Weinberg, Lucia Dunn, Manisha Goel, Dimitrios Nikolaou, Seth Gershensen, participants at the SEA, AEFP, and MEA conferences and seminar participants at Ohio State University, as well as colleagues and two anonymous referees, for helpful discussions and suggestions.

The analytical approach is based on the view that in order to understand the nature of the middle-income trap, it is necessary to understand the development process and policy ingredients of countries that have successfully made the transition from low-income to high-income countries without getting stuck in the middle. Alice Amsden's work is an essential source for this task. She does not, as far as I am aware, use the term middle-income trap, and apart from Amsden (1991), she largely ignores the urban question. Yet her work contains important insights that illuminate the nature of the middle-income trap. Focusing on Vietnam, the first part of the article identifies these insights and extends them to propose an analytical approach, whilst the second part describes the speed, distribution and form of urbanisation in Vietnam and applies the analytical approach to discuss ways in which the process of urbanisation is contributing to the country falling into, or avoiding, the trap.","[Gore, Charles] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Dept Econ, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Gore, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Dept Econ, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",charles.gore1@gmail.com,,,,,,,94,3,3,2,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Using a Risk-Risk trade-off survey, we elicit discount rates for fatality risks and establish discounting functional forms on both a sample and an individual level. We find wide variation in implicit discount rates for fatality risk between individuals, as well as between-individual heterogeneity in discounting functional forms. In aggregate, the sample is best characterised by subadditive discounting. Our work has implications for the academic investigation of intertemporal choice involving mortality risks, and potentially for the evaluation of policy options with delayed mortality risk outcomes. A thought experiment cautions against the standard practice of assuming that exponential discounting characterises society's time preferences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Because of the specific decision problem at hand, namely that with DIS the procedure has to take place within 21 days after the initial trauma, a decision tree was developed. The time horizon of the model was set to 3 years. Input data was taken from official tariffs, payer data, the literature and assumptions based on expert opinion when necessary. Results: The decision tree analysis identified the DIS strategy as the superior one with 2.34 QALY versus 2.26 QALY for the ACLR branch. The higher QALY also came with higher costs of 5,398.05 (sic) for the DIS branch versus 4,632.68 (sic) for the ACLR branch respectively, leading to an ICER of 9,092.66 (sic) per QALY. Results were robust after sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty was examined via probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulting in a slightly higher ICER of 9,567.13 (sic) per QALY gained. Conclusion: The DIS technology delivers an effective treatment for the ACL rupture at a favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.","[Bierbaum, Martin; Schoeffski, Oliver] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Nurnberg, Germany; [Schliemann, Benedikt; Koesters, Clemens] Univ Hosp Munster, Dept Trauma Hand & Reconstruct Surg, Munster, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Munster,"Bierbaum, M (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Nurnberg, Germany.",martin.bierbaum@fau.de,"Bierbaum, Martin/AAI-6476-2020; Laumann, Marion/AAX-3607-2021","Bierbaum, Martin/0000-0003-3708-0182;",Mathys Medical AG,Mathys Medical AG,The authors wish to thank Stefanie Dickmanken for coordinating and supervising the collection of the SF-12 questionnaires.

Scenario planning in the government not only tends to be focused on issues of higher complexity and significance to public policy, but also in comparison to people in the private business, public officials have fundamental psychological and institutional constraints in their scenario thinking. These constraints make it difficult for them to contemplate multiple 'untidy' futures and imagine the possibility of policy failure: skills which are essential for successful scenario projects. Based on specific characteristics of scenario planning in the Japanese government, this paper contributes on better understanding the challenges and strategic solutions in providing more successful scenario planning in the public sector. Specifically, this paper argues that possible solutions in overcoming these constraints may be to shake public bureaucrats out of their thinking by providing free and open venues of conversation and more importantly through 'derailment' exercises.

The implementation of these policies raises concerns about unintended adverse effects on the environment and local peoples' livelihoods. To prevent such effects, both processes involve developing country-level safeguards, so that they 'do no harm'. This paper presents (i) a comparison of the social safeguards of the FLEGT-VPA and REDD+ processes and an explanation of their commonalities and differences, and (ii) an exploration of the potential synergies and the challenges to realiling them. The three Main research methods used in the study were semi-structured interviews, content analysis of policy documents, and focus group discussions with local communities and indigenous peoples in south and east Cameroon. Our analysis shows that whereas FLEGT-VPA includes legality-based safeguards with legally binding monitoring and reporting obligations, REDD + adopts a right-based approach to safeguards. Potential synergies between the two approaches were identified. The synergies lie in the participatory nature of the process of designing benefit sharing mechanisms, strengthening forest and land tenure, and defining the criteria and indicators in FLEGT-VPA and REDD + safeguards. However, realizing the synergies is challenging, given the existing political economy of Cameroon. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The entrepreneurs and associations started to use this model as a significant financing, marketing and even consumer-relationship management tool. As well, it is a model that indirectly fosters economic growth through financing innovative and creative projects, often in cultural and creative industry's sector that, through numerous researches, already proved its economic significance. In the same time, the nascence and development of the crowdfunding raised numerous questions in the fields of legal regulation and modelling of this alternative financing source, project and product branding, consumer-relationship management, financial structuring, intellectual property protection, appropriate marketing mix structuring, risk management etc. In this constellation, it is interesting to observe and research the implications of the crowdfunding development as a model of financing different ventures and projects with different aims run by profit or non-profit sector, as well as observing the final solutions of the problems that crowdfunding found throughout its development stages. Although is well known as a financing model and with existing national crowdfunding platforms, the Croatian crowdfunding ventures are rare and mainly launched on the global platforms, where the national platforms did not succeed to impose themselves as an equally valuable alternative. This article presents the results of the research of the position of the crowdfunding in Croatia, where its appearance should influence on the corrections of venture financing market imperfections and at the same time offer the possibility to use global platforms to boost new services, products and ideas.","[Bukvic, Ivana Bestvina; Buljubasic, Iva] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bukvic, IB (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Osijek, Croatia.",ibbukvic@kulturologija.unios.hr; ibuljuba@kulturologija.unios.hr,"Bestvina Bukvić, Ivana/J-3206-2019","Bestvina Bukvić, Ivana/0000-0002-9157-1479",,,,,46,1,1,0,11,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,353,363,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700037,0

However, this objective may be defeated due to defects in the structure of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the resulting interpretations of WTO tribunals in cases involving clean energy subsidies. These defects, together with inefficient design of energy markets, could slow the transition to clean energy sources. However, the necessary reforms to the multilateral subsidies regime and energy markets are unlikely to be implemented any time soon, in the absence of a successful formula for multilateral negotiations. In this environment, the private sector will have to take the lead in making the transition to clean energy sources, in order to mitigate the disastrous effects of climate change to the extent that this goal remains attainable.","[Condon, Bradly J.] ITAM, Dept Law, Rio Hondo 1, Mexico City 01080, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Condon, BJ (通讯作者)，ITAM, Dept Law, Rio Hondo 1, Mexico City 01080, DF, Mexico.",bcondon@gmail.com,,,ITAM; Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura,ITAM; Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura,I gratefully acknowledge ITAM and the Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura for their generous support of this research.

In particular, CSR threshold for SOEs is lower in regions with high degree of marketization than in regions with low degree of marketization. The findings indicate that value-destroying effect occurs during CSR underinvestment phase, which is different from the overinvestment view.

Here we claim that transformation of Chinese economic system to market principles and implementation of IFRS could cause changes in recognized accounting principles and country's accounting profession and this could impact the economic system as a whole. Many similar features can be seen in both national economies. In our study we want to verify whether there are any differences in perception of accounting and accounting profession in Chinese companies in comparison to those in the Czech Republic. To assemble the opinions of respondents we use the questionnaire survey method. To evaluate the results of the investigation we use the statistical tests of correlation and F-test to test for the differences between the two sets of responses. Our results confirmed the validity of our hypothesis of existence of different opinions depending on nationality of respondents. We found that there are differences in both opinions on the role of accountants in business and in attitudes to selected business problems. Although the findings have several limitations due to sample selection, we can sum up that there exist significant differences in perception of the role of accounting and accountants between the two countries depending on historical traditions and different national environment in the two economies.","[Kubickova, Dana; Nulicek, Vladimir] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic; [Jindrichovska, Irena] Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic; Anglo-American University,"Kubickova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic.",dana.kubickova@mail.vsfs.cz; vnulicek@gmail.com; irena.jindrichovska@aauni.edu,"Nulícek, Vladimír/KCK-9802-2024; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-5867-2019; Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013","Nulícek, Vladimír/0000-0002-9245-1479;",[STF-AAU-2017-2],,"This paper was prepared with support of Research Project STF-AAU-2017-2 Perception of Accountants and Accounting Profession.

This means that the innovative abilities of small and medium-sized companies in Poland determine their development, as well as competitiveness. The hitherto studies on the innovativeness of Polish economy and its SMEs indicate that for many years, only a small part of them use innovation as a measure for development. This is the result of many barriers present in both Polish economy and within these companies. They are diverse in nature. External companies' innovativeness limits include economic, social, political, legal, cultural, technological, capital and market aspects. The internal determinants of this phenomenon include available resources, effective systems of communication, innovation-oriented organizational culture and leadership, the quality of human capital and creativity, as well as the structural determinants and sociological and psychological factors. All these areas may make up for the company development barriers or opportunities. The aim of the article is to present barriers to the SMEs development in Poland in the context of their innovativeness barriers. Using data from the reports of the European Commission, Innovation Union Scoreboard, Community Innovation Survey and the papers by Polish Agency of Entrepreneurship Development and the Main Statistical Office, the author has identified the cause of low innovativeness of Polish SMEs.

It points to the challenges with assessing tax gap numbers and reveals examples of its careless usage by various stakeholders in Swedish society in order to impact the discourse on tax compliance. Based on an ethnographic study of documents, it is an example of a number that performs a dual function: on the one hand mobilizing people's morals and subsequent commitments and on the other hand measuring such commitments. On a more general level, the tax gap is an example of how a number that describes a complicated reality is calculated with many caveats attached to it, yet used with certainty in society. I thus challenge the metaphor of the ubiquitous 'black box'. The Swedish tax gap number is a calculated device and can be unpacked as a specific number. But if we think about what a tax gap ought to contain, we have to think outside the box and beyond: what was not included in the published tax gap number and why there was no room for it.","[Larsen, Lotta Bjorklund] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Tema T, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Larsen, LB (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Tema T, Linkoping, Sweden.",lotta.bjorklund.larsen@liu.se,,"Bjorklund Larsen, Lotta/0000-0002-1088-065X",European Union [FairTax 649439],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 2014-2018, grant agreement No. FairTax 649439.",,41,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

J,"Lee, J",,,,"Lee, Jieun",,,China's Nonmarket Economy Treatment and US Trade Remedy Actions,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The price comparability provision of China's accession protocol recognizes that WTO members may face special difficulty in determining subsidies and dumping from China, due to its government's pervasive intervention in the economy. The provision permits importing members to disregard domestic prices or costs in China and to use alternative benchmarks in determining the normal value of Chinese exports. Consequently, this so-called nonmarket economy (NME) methodology tends to inflate antidumping and countervailing duty rates. Certain paragraphs of the provision determining dumping expire on 11 December 2016, and yet the heated debate on China's economic status post-December 2016 remains ongoing. This article studies the history of US trade remedy actions against nonmarket economies and traces recent developments and findings at the WTO dispute settlement body. Congressional history shows that antidumping regulations in the US have been constantly amended to catch up with agency practices that discriminate against nonmarket economies. Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce (DOC) recently started to apply countervailing duties on Chinese imports and has finally codified such practices into law. The article offers many reasons to believe that the US is equipped with various trade remedy measures to continue 'special treatment' against China, even if the country graduates from a NME status.","[Lee, Jieun] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",leejieun@umich.edu,,"Lee, Jieun/0000-0002-6370-0333",,,,,27,0,0,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The EU embraces the IFRS and EU member states update their national laws accordingly. Since the valuation of stock is a challenge for US GAAP, IFRS and Czech national standards, it is relevant to examine their conceptual approaches and then confront them with a real Czech case study with inside data. The price paid for stock in the given case departed from the value based on the standards, and the presented accounting and contractual price growth rate brings suggestions regarding the valuation of the stock of a company where a power battle over the control takes place. The underlying quasi-hypothesis about the ephemeral value of the stock is getting confirmed and the reasons for that are becoming recognized. Due to the conceptual instability regarding the legal fiction of the legal personality of a company, the virtual nature of stock and other factors, the ephemeral value of a stock can hardly be fully captured. The situation of a power battle demonstrates the inherent subjectivity and particularity. However, still the current valuation and appropriate standards could be improved, provided a deeper understanding of the nature of stock is achieved. Further, economic, law and behavioral aspects should be commonly appreciated and thus push the holistic understanding closer to the reality of business and life in the global post-modern society in the 21st century.","[MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka] Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cvik, Eva Daniela] Czech Univ Life Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"MacGregor Pelikánová, R (通讯作者)，Anglo Amer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic.",radkamacgregor@yahoo.com; cvik@pef.czu.cz,"MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018; Vrana, Ivan/H-1768-2018; Cvik, Eva Daniela/H-1768-2018","MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146; Vrana, Ivan/0000-0001-5920-5631; Cvik, Eva Daniela/0000-0002-8873-8039",,,,,36,0,0,0,1,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,158,172,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100012,0

That is how the division into small - with up to 5 members of staff, medium-sized - employing from 6 to 50 people and big - with more than 50 employees - enterprises was introduced. However, due to the need to adjust the GUS criteria to the EU standards a new division of companies was implemented for the reporting needs, namely: micro-companies with 0 - 9 employees, small businesses employing 10-49 people, medium-sized ones with the headcount of 50 - 249 and big enterprises having the workforce of more than 250 people. Currently the sector comprising micro, small and medium-sized enterprises is a dominant group of business entities in the European economy. There are almost 2.6 million entrepreneurs who conduct their business in EU member states. Small and medium-sized companies account for 99.8% of the total number of non-financial enterprises. The prevailing group here - representing 92.4% of such businesses - are micro-businesses, 6.4% are small companies and 1% are medium-sized enterprises. When compared to the EU's average, the largest sector of SMEs can be found in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The benefits of having small and medium-sized companies had not been recognised in Poland until 1990s. Then the government started a number of initiatives designed to show some directions for development and provide support to this group of market participants, as well as launching a series of programs, such as Small and medium-sized enterprises in the economy in 1995, The directions of the government's activities towards small and medium-sized enterprises for up to 2002 in 1999 and Entrepreneurship first in 2002.

The government has promoted the use of RES by biomass cogeneration and power plants as well as biogas cogeneration plants by means of various support policy instruments. Consequently, the electricity output from RES comprised 51 % of the total electricity output in 2014 and, on average, 48 % in the period 2011-2014. Although the support policy for RES use fostered the development of this industry in Latvia, a number of restrictions were imposed in recent years - a 10 % subsidised electricity tax (SET) rate was applied to taxable income from electricity production from RES in 2014 and a decision was made in 2016 to differentiate the mandatory procurement component (MPC) in 2018. The research aim is to analyse trends in the development of RES in Latvia. To achieve the aim, the following specific tasks were set: 1) to give insight into the situation in the field of RES in Latvia, placing a particular focus on electricity generated from the RES; 2) to analyse the most important RES policy developments in Latvia; 3) to assess the RES support policy implementation results for electricity generation from the RES and to outline an expected RES policy in the EU beyond 2020. The research has found that the greatest threats to RES use are an imprudent policy of the government of Latvia, which could create incomprehension among the public and an unsTable and unpredicTable business environment. However, EU policy softening regarding RES can influence the EU's leading role in the field of the RES. For this reason, the positive effects from RES use - energy efficiency, environmental protection and regional development - could decrease in the future.","[Rubins, Mareks; Pilvere, Irina] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Rubins, M (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Mareks.Rubins@llu.lv,"Pilvere, Irina/GNM-7700-2022","Pilvere, Irina/0000-0002-8467-1949",,,,,25,7,7,0,6,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-260-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,44,,,,,281,291,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406529200034,0

The aim of this paper is to estimate an influence of different factors on energy efficiency in the case of Lithuania and Ukraine. The study covers 1995-2013. GLS regression framework is used. It is found that for Ukraine and Lithuania an increase in GDP per capita by one percent does increase per capita energy consumption by 0.23 percent. Thus, current paper confirms the hypothesis that the wealthier the society becomes, the more amount of energy per capita it consumes. Also it was found that countries in transition do become more energy efficient compared to their initial position, and an increase in GDP per capita by one percent does increase GDP per one kilogram of oil by 0.51 percent. Since per capita GDP in Lithuania is three times higher than in Ukraine, it means that Lithuanian achievements are much more significant than Ukrainian ones. Oil price fluctuations are appeared to be an important source of energy efficiency improvements. The structural changes towards information society development and green economy have a positive influence on reduction of energy consumption per capita and energy efficiency growth due the decrease of industry share of the economy.","[Sineviciene, Lina; Lakstutiene, Ausrine] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sotnyk, Iryna; Kubatko, Oleksandr] Sumy State Univ, Sumy, Ukraine",Kaunas University of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University,"Sineviciene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.sineviciene@ktu.lt,"Sotnyk, Iryna/ABF-4274-2021; Sineviciene, Lina/M-7562-2018; Kubatko, Oleksandr/P-8515-2019","Sotnyk, Iryna/0000-0001-5787-2481; Kubatko, Oleksandr/0000-0001-6396-5772",Research Council of Lithuania [TAP LU-4-2016]; State Budget of Ukraine [0116U007179],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)); State Budget of Ukraine,"This research was funded by a grant (No. TAP LU-4-2016) from the Research Council of Lithuania.

Data to be analysed come from the Albertina database. They include complete financial statements of building enterprises that operated on the market between 2006 and 2015. The data is organized into a table the EVA Equity in each enterprise is calculated per each year of its operation on the market. The table is subsequently imported into the Statistica software which searches for the extent to which the EVA Equity indicator is dependent on the individual items of financial statements. The result is a created adequate methodology and identification of value generators in building industries from 2006 to 2015 in the Czech Republic.

In contrast to previous studies of consumers' willingness to pay for ecolabeled seafood, this article analyzes retailers' best pricing strategy when consumer preferences for ecolabeled seafood are heterogeneous. An auction experiment involving consumers in Tokyo is analyzed with a latent class model to estimate variation in willingness to pay, differentiated by consumer characteristics. Results show that there is heterogeneity in price premiums, implying that representative consumer estimates are misleading. Further, higher premiums are not easily associated with observable demographic factors or high willingness to pay for the unlabeled product, leading to a complex pricing problem for retailers who wish to capture maximum revenue through price pairs for unlabeled seafood and seafood bearing an ecolabel for sustainability.","[Wakamatsu, Hiroki] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa Ku, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan; [Anderson, Christopher M.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 Boat St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Uchida, Hirotsugu] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Roheim, Cathy A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Rhode Island; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Wakamatsu, H (通讯作者)，Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa Ku, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan.",hwakamatsu@affrc.go.jp; huchida@uri.edu; croheim@uidaho.edu,"Uchida, Hirotsugu/AAD-2401-2019","Uchida, Hirotsugu/0000-0003-3675-806X",WWF-Japan; WWFUS; Asahi Breweries Foundation; Rhode Island Sea Grant; Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) [5353],WWF-Japan; WWFUS; Asahi Breweries Foundation; Rhode Island Sea Grant; Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (AES),"The authors appreciate the cooperation of Kamewa Shouten Co., Ltd. and Co-op Tokyo.

Various MCDM methods find solution for decision problems using different normalization methods. Normalization process has an important role in decision process and can modify the ranking and final decision. Due to uncertainty associated with data in decision making about materials and design, COPRAS method with interval numbers (COPRAS-G) was recognized as a promising approach in this regard. This paper intends to apply COPRAS-G method in several specific material evaluation studies. Normalization tools are positioned in COPRAS method to check the effect of each tool.

The results show depending on the number of criteria and number of alternatives material, ranking can be changed when a different normalization tools are considered. This help designers and engineers to achieve a compromise on design decision making process, especially when the material properties and design performance criteria are affected from stochastic nature of design and manufacturing parameters.","[Yazdani, Morteza] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Social Sci, Dept Business Management, Madrid 28670, Spain; [Jahan, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Semnan Branch, Semnan, Iran; [Zavadskas, EdmundasKazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",European University of Madrid; Islamic Azad University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Yazdani, M (通讯作者)，Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Social Sci, Dept Business Management, Madrid 28670, Spain.",morteza_yazdani@yahoo.com; iranalijahan@yahoo.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"yazdani, morteza/Q-2242-2019; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Jahan, Ali/B-2460-2010","yazdani, morteza/0000-0001-5526-8950; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,25,27,28,0,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

This strategy has been explored on the island of Palawan in the Philippines for indigenous wild honey hunter and gatherers through a community forestry enterprise, which transformed a traditional practice of honey gathering into an economic activity. In this paper, we conducted an integrated value chain analysis to assess whether the enterprise is able to support livelihoods in a fair and just manner, maintain its natural capital, and preserve indigenous culture. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, we found that downstream actors capture most of the economic value of wild honey by having a gross margin of 585.00 Philippine Peso (PhP) per kilo of honey compared to 30.74 PhP per kilo gross margin of honey hunters. The Tagbanua honey hunters do not perform hunting rituals previously performed by their ancestors. Majority of the community members still use honey, but in low amounts, i.e. less than one liter per year. In conclusion, we establish that commercializing traditional indigenous practices as a livelihood strategy should not only focus on positive gross margins but also consider socio-cultural practices and ecological sustainability.","[Matias, Denise Margaret S.; Stellmacher, Till; Borgemeister, Christian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Matias, Denise Margaret S.] German Dev Inst, DIE, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Tambo, Justice A.] CABI, Rue Grillons 1, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland; [von Wehrden, Henrik] Leuphana Univ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",University of Bonn; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Leuphana University Luneburg,"Matias, DMS (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",denise.matias@uni-bonn.de,,"Matias, Denise Margaret/0000-0002-6047-1176",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Foundation fiat panis; Eva Crane Trust,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Foundation fiat panis; Eva Crane Trust,"The authors thank the Tagbanua community, NATRIPAL, NTFP-EP Asia, Daniel Callo-Concha, and Jun Cayron for providing insights on the study.

Risk selection can occur in the presence of unpriced risk heterogeneity, which refers to predictable variation in health care spending not reflected in either premiums by insurers or risk equalization payments. This paper examines unpriced risk heterogeneity within risk groups distinguished by the sophisticated Dutch risk equalization model of 2016. Our strategy is to combine the administrative dataset used for estimation of the risk equalization model (n=16.9 million) with information derived from a large health survey (n=387k). The survey information allows for explaining and predicting residual spending of the risk equalization model. Based on the predicted residual spending, two metrics are used to indicate unpriced risk heterogeneity at the individual level and at the level of certain (risk) groups: the correlation coefficient between residual spending and predicted residual spending, and the mean absolute value of predicted residual spending. The analyses yield three main findings: (1) the health survey information is able to explain some residual spending of the risk equalization model, (2) unpriced risk heterogeneity exists both in morbidity and in non-morbidity groups, and (3) unpriced risk heterogeneity increases with predicted spending by the risk equalization model. These findings imply that the sophisticated Dutch risk equalization model does not completely remove unpriced risk heterogeneity. Further improvement of the model should focus on broadening and refining the current set of morbidity-based risk adjusters.","[Withagen-Koster, A. A.; van Kleef, R.

In Europe, the European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) has been aspiring to develop and implement standards for international sharing of HTA results and studies. Slovakia and many other EU countries do not have an established HTA system yet. This paper is focused on an exact description of the EUnetHTA Core Model individual domains applied to the process of selecting patients in the terminal stage of prostate cancer for Radium-223 treatment under particular conditions of the Institute of Nuclear and Molecular Medicine (INMM) in Koice, Slovakia.ResultsWe produced the first pilot HTA report using the HTA Core Model in Slovakia. The main objective was to collect all relevant information on the particular technology, and provide its summary to the interested stakeholders on one spot. Rather than applying detailed individual items, i.e. assessment elements and assessment element cards, we concentrated on the content of individual domains and tried to fill them with the best country, facility and intervention related data. The dataset consisted of 52 patients that finished the treatment in the period 2015-2017. The patients were carefully selected according to the Radium-223 producer's criteria. Only 33 patients received the full therapy consisting of six applications; their average survival was 10.5months from the application of the last dose.ConclusionsBased on the results of our analyzes, we recommended several changes to the INMM processes and patient follow-up checks during the treatment process in order to make the therapy more effective. The greatest benefit is expected after the implementation of a Ge-68/Ga-68 generator in 2018, as the selection of patients suitable for the Radium-223 treatment will improve. We showed that the HTA Core Model can be implemented in Slovakia, even under conditions of no formal HTA support or institutionalization.","[Bilekova, Beata Kiselova] Inst Nucl & Mol Med, Imaging Diagnost Dept, Rastislavova 785-43, Kosice 04253, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata] TECHNICOM, Res & Innovat Ctr Bioinformat, Nemcovej 5, Kosice, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Rogalewicz, Vladimir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, CzechHTA, Nam Sitna 3105, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic",Technical University Kosice; Czech Technical University Prague,"Bilekova, BK (通讯作者)，Inst Nucl & Mol Med, Imaging Diagnost Dept, Rastislavova 785-43, Kosice 04253, Slovakia.",bilekova@inmm.sk,"Rogalewicz, Vladimír/H-6246-2011; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Rogalewicz, Vladimír/0000-0001-5432-4148; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [1/0846/18]","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","The Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic -Project VEGA No. 1/0846/18: Evaluation of the efficiency of public procurement of selected commodities in healthcare facilities in the Slovak Republic.",,42,3,3,1,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

An important element of classroom flipping is that elements of active learning (e.g. games, experiments and polling) are brought into the classroom setting and that content delivery is moved (at least partially) from the classroom to the virtual learning environment. This paper discusses the developments that have prepared the ground for the increasing uptake of classroom flipping, namely technical innovations and a better appreciation of how students learn. In our view the flipped classroom approach has significant promise beyond the already existing implementations, mostly by enthusiastic teaching staff. As many of the technical challenges have been solved it is now the willingness, the availability of time, and the recognition and reward of any effort to change the delivery approach that will prove to be the most significant hurdles for further adoptions.","[Becker, Ralf] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Birdi, Alvin] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Birdi, Alvin] Econ Network, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Manchester; University of Bristol,"Becker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",ralf.becker@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,4,9,12,2,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

Focusing on cleaning work in the food and beverage industry, this case study examines some early outcomes of this national drive to reduce wage inequality by improving the pay and conditions of commodified work in a sector subject to outsourcing-based cost competition. Based on interviews with cleaners, supervisors and managers, the findings suggest that in general, government and the trade union and employers' association have worked together, to set wages and conditions transparently. Nevertheless, enforcement issues mean that cleaners remain vulnerable. They have limited information about their employment benefits and face various types of poor conditions, some sanctioned by and others in violation of labour laws. These vulnerabilities have structural roots, including rent imbalances and cheap sourcing, factors that commodify jobs. The implementation of the Progressive Wage Model may have helped de-commodify cleaning jobs for Singaporeans and permanent residents, but such outcomes are still dependent on non-systemic and unenforceable factors such as the kindness of individual supervisors. While a promising start has been made, Singapore's initial efforts to improve incomes and conditions in low-wage work will nevertheless require stronger regulatory commitment.

From a comparative law standpoint, this article seeks to analyse the role played by Convention No. 189 on regulatory reforms, focusing on the legislative measures taken in three Latin American countries that have ratified it: Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. An analysis is also made of the discussions and controversies that have determined the way in which the working time and wage provisions contained in the Convention have been incorporated into the national laws on paid domestic work in these three countries.","[Poblete, Lorena] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IDES, CIS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Poblete, L (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IDES, CIS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",lorena.poblete@conicet.gov.ar,,"Poblete, Lorena/0000-0002-0579-4255","Fung Global Fellows Program, Princeton University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (National Scientific and Technical Research Council, CONICET), Argentina","Fung Global Fellows Program, Princeton University; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (National Scientific and Technical Research Council, CONICET), Argentina","Researcher, Centro de Investigaciones Sociales, CIS-CONICET/IDES, Argentina, email:lorena.poblete@conicet.gov.ar.

We employed longitudinal administrative data from Spain (2004-2010) to explore the relationship between uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and health care utilisation. We used a biomarker (glycated haemoglobin, HbA1c) to detect the presence of uncontrolled diabetes and explore its effects on both primary and secondary health care. We estimated a range of panel count data models, including negative binomials with random effects, dynamic and hurdle specifications to account for unobserved heterogeneity, previous utilisation and selection. We found uncontrolled diabetes in between 27 and 30% of patients of both genders. Our estimates suggested that although women appeared to systematically consume more health care compared to men, their consumption levels did not seem to be influenced by uncontrolled diabetes. Conversely, among men uncontrolled diabetes increased the average number of GP visits per year by between 3 and 3.4%, specialist visits by 5.3-6.1%, depending on specifications, and also extended annual hospital length of stay by 15%. We also found some evidence of heterogeneity in utilisation based on the level of uncontrolled diabetes among male individuals. Overall, our results suggested the need for different diabetes management plans depending on gender and levels of glycaemic control.","[Gil, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Gil, Joan] Univ Barcelona, BEAT, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sicras-Mainar, Antoni] BSA, Barcelona, Spain; [Zucchelli, Eugenio] Univ Lancaster, DHR, Lancaster, England",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Lancaster University,"Gil, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Gil, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, BEAT, 696 Diagonal Ave, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",joangil@ub.edu,"Gil Trasfí, Joan/N-6360-2014; Zucchelli, Eugenio/Z-4871-2019","Gil Trasfí, Joan/0000-0003-4159-379X; Zucchelli, Eugenio/0000-0003-3883-5006",Catalan Government [2014-SGR-1257],Catalan Government,"We are grateful to Bruce Hollingsworth, Paolo Li Donni, Ian Walker, Will Whittaker, Giuseppe Moscelli and participants to the 2015 UK Health Economists Study Group (HESG) Conference, XXXV Spanish Health Economics Association Conference, 11th World Congress of the International Health Economics Association (iHEA) and the 2016 EuHEA Conference for helpful comments.

Little attention is paid to who wins and who loses out infra-nationally. I argue that in Germany the EMU has reinforced dualization, the insider-outsider cleavage in the country's welfare state and production model. To scrutinize this argument, I analyze longitudinal linked employer-employee data (N > 9.6 mio) and pursue a mechanistic three-step identification strategy: first, I illustrate how the introduction of the euro distorted real interest and exchange rates within the eurozone. Second, I demonstrate how these imbalances redistributed rents from the domestic sector, in particular from construction, to the core manufacturing industry. Third, I show how this shift in industry rents reverberated to the wage distribution and increased inequality. The study contributes to resolve the puzzle why wage inequality in Germany increased through a fanning out of the wage distribution whereas countries similarly exposed to technological change and globalization grew unequal through a polarization of their wage distribution.","[Ochsenfeld, Fabian] Goethe Univ, Inst Sociol, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Ochsenfeld, F (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Inst Sociol, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",ochsenfeld@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,,"German Science Foundation (DFG) [1764, GA 758/4-1]",German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was funded by Priority Program 1764 of the German Science Foundation (DFG) project GA 758/4-1 Organizational Structure, Technological Change and Rising Wage Inequality in Germany: An Empirical Study Using Linked-Employer-Employee Data and LOEWE Center Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe.",,79,6,6,3,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Based on a review of thirty management plans, stakeholder consultations, intensive interactions with six forest user groups, forest officials, and donor project employees in Nepal, we document the mechanisms of legal-sounding re-centralisation. The central tenet is that bureaucratically established procedures, which are not required by law but treated as if they were, are used to impose regular revisions of community forest management plans. Meagre government or more generous donor budgets financed the revisions. Forest bureaucrats and/or consultants did the work and benefitted financially. None of the approaches, however, lived up to technical, scientific standards or followed stipulated participatory processes. The revised plans were almost identical to their previous versions and differences mostly a result of mere desk exercises to fulfil donor requirements and government orders, at least on paper. While legitimised by a perceived promotion of rational, technical sound, and equitable forest governance, the main function of plan revisions appears to be strengthening or re-establishing the forest bureaucracy's control over community forest resources which allows forest bureaucrats to tap into donor project and forest product value chains.","[Basnyat, Bijendra; Pokharel, Ridish Kumar; Lamsal, Lok Nath; Rayamajhi, Santosh] Inst Forestry, Hariyo Kharka 33700, Pokhara, Nepal; [Basnyat, Bijendra; Treue, Thorsten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Tribhuvan University; Institute of Forestry (IOF) - Nepal; University of Copenhagen,"Basnyat, B (通讯作者)，Inst Forestry, Hariyo Kharka 33700, Pokhara, Nepal.;Basnyat, B (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",bbasnyat@yahoo.com; ttr@ifro.ku.dk,"Lamsal, Lok/G-4781-2012","Treue, Thorsten/0000-0003-4321-5346",Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs [13-05KU],Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"We are thankful for the 'Science and Power in Participatory Forestry' (13-05KU) funded by the Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Despite recent reforms of resource governance, many countries are yet to develop effective formal mechanisms to resolve land and forest conflicts effectively, and mediation has emerged as an alternative conflict resolution strategy. This article contributes to the ongoing discussion of global large-scale land acquisitions ('land grabs') by examining how such third-party mediation works to resolve land conflicts. Bringing together mediation and the political economy literature, it considers how mediation works, and how politics, institutions and power shape the conflict mediation process and its outcomes. It derives its conclusions from extensive fieldwork based examinations of four 'successful' mediation cases in oil palm and pulpwood plantations in Indonesia. Our study finds that the ability of local disputants to sustain collective action, to transnationalize disputes, to intensify and to ripen the conflict are all critical in shaping mediation processes. While the empowerment of local communities can support mediation and improve procedural fairness, mediation only provides a partial solution to the conflicts caused by large-scale land acquisitions. Wider reforms to State law and land governance system, and initiatives to address key structural problems are required. Given the widespread use of third-party mediation to resolve conflicts across the Global South, the lessons from this study are relevant to the discussion of large-scale land acquisitions elsewhere.","[Dhiaulhaq, Ahmad; McCarthy, John F.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Yasmi, Yurdi] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Reg Off Asia & Pacific, Bangkok, Thailand",Australian National University; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Dhiaulhaq, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",ahmad.dhiaulhaq@anu.edu.au; john.mccarthy@anu.edu.au; yurdi.yasmi@fao.org,"Dhiaulhaq, Ahmad/J-5640-2019","Dhiaulhaq, Ahmad/0000-0001-6420-9936",Endeavour Scholarships; Crawford School of Public Policy (ANU); Ruth Daroesman Study Grant (ANU College of Asia and the Pacific),Endeavour Scholarships; Crawford School of Public Policy (ANU); Ruth Daroesman Study Grant (ANU College of Asia and the Pacific),"The first author would like to express sincere gratitude to Dr. Keith Barney and Dr. Kylie McKenna for innumerable academic inputs in the design of the research, and to the Endeavour Scholarships for funding his PhD study.

Our results indicate that both observed heterogeneity and positive true state dependence contribute to the persistence of care arrangements. Evidence of positive true state dependence for most or all modes of care in all models suggests that inertia generally dominates caregiver burnout. Our results indicate that formal care decisions depend on the cost and quality of care. As a result of inertia, the effectiveness of long-term care policy depends on timing: initial caregiving decisions are more sensitive than subsequent decisions to economic incentives.","[Hiedemann, Bridget] Seattle Univ, Econ, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Sovinsky, Michelle] Univ Mannheim, Econ, Mannheim, Germany; [Sovinsky, Michelle] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Stern, Steven] SUNY Stony Brook, Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Seattle University; University of Mannheim; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Stern, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",steven.stern@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,76,9,10,4,31,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Evidence on the impact of state laws on bullying in schools,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bullying; Schools; Program and policy evaluation; Health; Human capital,VIOLENCE,"Bullying is a prevalent problem. Researchers have provided legislative recommendations to combat it. Examining whether, and to what extent, state laws reduce in-school bullying is important for several reasons beyond providing guidance for federal legislation that would unify state laws. Bullying can be financially problematic for schools. An economics literature suggests bullying may have serious negative labor market consequences by disrupting cognitive and non-cognitive skill development. Bullying during youth may carry over into adulthood and have longer-run impacts within households, labor markets, and the larger economy. I conduct student- and school-level policy evaluations exploiting variation in timing and type of law in conjunction with data from large nationally representative surveys. State legislation may have little effect on reported bullying in high schools, however, reported bullying occurs most often in middle schools. Estimated policy impacts vary across elementary, middle and high school student populations. Current challenges facing research on bullying are revealed.","[Manzella, Julia] US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Manzella, J (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",julia.ann.manzella@census.gov,,"Manzella, Julia/0000-0002-3374-9275",Dan E.

In England, a new prospective provider payment system is being introduced to mental health that should encourage providers to control costs and improve outcomes. The aim of this research is to investigate the relationship between costs and outcomes to ascertain whether there is a trade-off between controlling costs and improving outcomes. The main data source is the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS) for the years 2011/12 and 2012/13. Costs are calculated using NHS reference cost data while outcomes are measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). We estimate a bivariate multi-level model with costs and outcomes simultaneously. We calculate the correlation and plot the pairwise relationship between residual costs and outcomes at the provider level. After controlling for a range of demographic, need, social, and treatment variables, residual variation in costs and outcomes remains at the provider level. The correlation between residual costs and outcomes is negative, but very small, suggesting that cost-containment efforts by providers should not undermine outcome-improving efforts under the new payment system.","[Moran, Valerie] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Jacobs, Rowena] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of York - UK,"Moran, V (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",valerie.moran@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Jacobs, Rowena/0000-0001-5225-6321",Centre for Health Economics (University of York),Centre for Health Economics (University of York),"This work is funded by a Centre for Health Economics (University of York) PhD Studentship held by Valerie Moran.

Our paper investigates this issue for the Food and Drug Administration's pediatric exclusivity policy, which offers drug sponsors a six-month exclusivity extension for conducting additional pediatric studies of marketed drugs. Policy makers wanted to encourage pediatric studies for drugs that are medically important for children. However, since the exclusivity extension covers all indications and its private value increases with total sales, firms may have greater incentives to study drugs with large adult markets rather than drugs that are medically important to children. We use data from IMS Health, Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, and the FDA to investigate the determinants of the FDA's demand and firms' supply of pediatric studies. We find that firms are more likely to conduct pediatric studies for drugs with larger sales markets, but little evidence that the likelihood of conducting the study relates to a drug's medical importance to children. Firms also conducted pediatric studies for older drugs with less remaining patent life over newer drugs. Our results provide evidence of incentive distortions from the policy design.","[Olson, Mary K.] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Olson, Mary K.] Tulane Univ, Murphy Inst, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Yin, Nina] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tulane University; Tulane University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Olson, MK (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.;Olson, MK (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Murphy Inst, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",molson3@tulane.edu,,,,,,,40,8,8,2,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

In this new context of labour relations, experiences and expectations of each other are key drivers for the primary parties to this social dialogue. There has been little systematic research investigating the conditions for constructive social dialogue, particularly when it comes to soft factors', such as perceived competences, trust, influence and conflict behaviours. Addressing these issues based on theories of conflict, trust and influence, this article investigates experiences and expectations of employee representatives on the part of human resource managers, their counterparts in social dialogue. The results of surveys conducted in 11 European countries indicate that, overall, employers found a model of structured dialogue with elected employee representatives useful. Furthermore, competences of employee representatives, cooperative conflict behaviours, informal relations and trust promoted the influence of employee representatives on organisational decision-making and the quality of these decisions. We discuss implications for different systems of industrial relations.","[Romero Pender, Erica] Univ Seville, Dept Work & Org Psychol, Seville, Spain; [Munduate, Lourdes] Univ Seville, Org Psychol, Seville, Spain; [Belen Garcia, Ana] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Romero Pender, Erica; Belen Garcia, Ana] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Euwema, Martin C.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Org psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Elgoibar, Patricia] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; University of Barcelona,"Elgoibar, P (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Business, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",patriciaelgoibar@ub.edu,"Munduate, Lourdes/F-8379-2010; Elgoibar, Patricia/AAV-2756-2021; Elgoibar, Patricia/AAB-6029-2021","Elgoibar, Patricia/0000-0001-7578-846X; Euwema, Martin/0000-0003-0981-4855; Garcia Jurado, Ana Belen/0000-0002-6057-0588","European Commission Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion [VS/2010/0376, VS/2012/0416]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [PSI2015-64894]","European Commission Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","The research on which this article is based was funded by European Commission Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion VS/2010/0376 and VS/2012/0416, and partially supported by Grant PSI2015-64894-(MINECO/FEDER) from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.",,83,5,5,5,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This method is routinely used in environmental economics to derive the economic valuation of environmental attributes such as air pollution and water quality. For example, the Ricardian approach is based on a hedonic regression of land values on historical climate variables. Forecasts of future climate can then be employed to estimate the future costs of climate change. We show that this approach is only valid if current land markets ignore climate forecasts. While this assumption was defensible decades ago (when this literature first emerged), it is reasonable to hypothesize that information on climate change is so pervasive today that markets may already price in expectations of future climate change. Indeed, we show empirically that agricultural land markets in the United States now capitalize expectations about future climate change. We derive a straightforward empirical correction to the standard Ricardian approach (called the Forward-Looking Ricardian Approach) that can be implemented with readily available data. Accounting for market beliefs decreases the estimated magnitude of climate change damages by 50%-62%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Unique regional socio-economic conditions also significantly impact stakeholder requirements of globally acting forest sector companies. Therefore, forest based sector decision makers have to be aware of regionally-specific and context sensitive sustainability concerns, when assessing and prioritizing sustainability issues. Sustainability research is considered to have a regional focus and a problem-driven perspective. Hence, research foci of scientific discussion on sustainable forest management can provide insight into regional differences and problems of sustainable forest management. We conducted a quantitative content analysis of 643 scientific abstracts in the context of sustainable forest management. We observed 16 different topic categories, out of which the topics of forest health and conservation and forest management practices represent the dominant foci. Furthermore, our results confirm a strong impact of geographic scope on the research foci. For example, the issues of climate change mitigation and adaptation are significantly more investigated in the Global North while social impacts of forest management are more researched in the Global South. Our findings suggest that decision makers should consider more than environmental issues when selecting corporate social responsibility activities or when making environmental policies. Otherwise, they can potentially overlook the impacts of forest management which are of high regional importance and intensively investigated by the scientific community.","[Sutterluty, Andrea; Simunovic, Nenad; Hesser, Franziska] Kompetenzzentrum Holz Wood K Plus, Team Mkt Anal & Innovat Res, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Stern, Tobias; Schober, Andreas] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Schuster, Kurt Christian] Lenzing Aktiengesell, Dept Global Sustainabil, Werkstr 2, A-4860 Lenzing, Austria",University of Graz,"Simunovic, N (通讯作者)，Kompetenzzentrum Holz Wood K Plus, Team Mkt Anal & Innovat Res, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",n.Simunovic@kplus-wood.at,"Stern, Tobias/V-9665-2017","Hesser, Franziska/0000-0002-0070-4695; Stern, Tobias/0000-0003-2336-5910",Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the COMET Program [844608],Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the COMET Program,This work was supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) under the COMET Program Grant Number 844608.,,64,8,11,3,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,142,150,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.02.003,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300016,0

The focus on workers rather than industries as the unit of analysis allows me to investigate previously unobserved outcomes, such as (i) unemployment rates, labor force participation rates, and the natures of layoffs and new hires and (ii) the distributional effects of these policies, both of which are critical to understanding costs and their distributions associated with environmental policies. Exploiting the introduction of a revenue-neutral carbon tax in British Columbia (BC), I find that environmental taxes, though revenue-neutral, tax away jobs disproportionately, more likely from less-educated workers. In particular, the policy increases the unemployment rates of medium- and low-educated males by 1.4 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. The policy is implemented mainly at the expense of the low-educated: because of these job losses, some engage in temporary and part-time jobs, and, eventually, some, being discouraged workers, leave the labor force, with the caveat that the effects could, though unlikely, be partially driven by an unobserved differential shock to BC's labor market.

We decided to create a feasible concept applicable for next decades with the use of modem technology and biomimicry. In our device, we used a biomimetic approach to design artificial surfaces that are capable of directed liquid transport, based on the principles found in the Texas homed lizard. For this purpose, we analyzed the morphology of the capillary network of Phrynosoma cornutum and characterized the material properties of the animal's surface. The final result was a balcony cultivator sustainable device which is divided into three functional parts that mutually support each other. The first is a bottom part for composting, the second part is used for plant cultivation and the third part serves the irrigation. Balcony cultivator project is still at the conceptual stage, but within the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge Accelerator programme, the research team has already solved prototyping, testing, and developing business plans for product launch.

Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in nurse turnover results in a facility receiving 1.8 additional deficiencies per annual regulatory survey, reflecting a 16.5 percent increase. Not accounting for endogeneity of turnover leads to results that suggest only a 1 percent increase in deficiencies.

A labor supply model with both fixed and cluster effects were used to identify the programs' disparate impacts in the different regions and on various policy stages. We found the following results: (i) the overall effect of the SLCP was pronounced in relation to the off-farm participation time, but it weakened gradually after the first policy stage; (ii) the DCBT had less impact than the SLCP in increasing the work time of farmers who already had off-farm jobs, but it was better than the SLCP during the various subsidy policy stages; (iii) the NFPP's total effect was insignificant; (iv) forestry subsidies tended to be decoupled for farmers in China, since the substitution effect was greater than the income effect and increased the supply of non-agricultural labor hours.

Using cross-sectional data from the REFLEX Project, we investigate the effect of personal competencies (both cognitive and non-cognitive) on two labour market outcomes among European university graduates: occupational status and earnings. Our estimates suggest that individuals endowed with a higher level of competencies are more likely to occupy managerial and professional positions and, to a lesser extent, technician jobs. Additionally, they also receive higher wages, but the relation is only significant for men. When we distinguish competencies according to their cognitive or non-cognitive nature, we find that only the latter are significant in explaining occupational status. in contrast, cognitive competencies are more related with wages. As regards the role of specific competencies, our findings suggest that leadership is the most relevant competence for the occupational status of males, especially in managerial positions. In contrast, initiative and enterprise abilities seem to be the most relevant skills for women in such positions. Intelligence produces the highest rewards in terms of earnings among the male subsample, while none of the competencies exerts a significant impact on females' wages.","[Blazquez, Maite; Herrarte, Ainhoa; Llorente-Heras, Raquel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Hist, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Herrarte, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal Econ Theory & Hist, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",maite.blazquez@uam.es; ainhoa.herrarte@uam.es; raquel.llorente@uam.es,"Blazquez, Maite/V-8795-2018; Herrarte, Ainhoa/L-2458-2013","Blazquez, Maite/0000-0002-2152-890X; Herrarte, Ainhoa/0000-0003-3414-8487",,,,,98,31,33,2,54,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Several studies have been carried out in this field, but they generally use information in a reduced context. The majority are based solely on parameters, using traditional methods which often lead to unsatisfactory solutions. This work consists in hybridizing through genetic algorithms, economic intelligence (El) and multicriteria analysis methods (MCA) to improve the decisions of territorial localization. The purpose is to lead the company to locate its activity in the place that would allow it a competitive advantage. This work also consists of identifying all the parameters that can influence the decision of the economic actors and equipping them with tools using all the national and international data available to lead to a mapping of countries, regions or departments favorable to the location. Throughout our research, we have as a goal the realization of a hybrid conceptual model of economic intelligence based on multicriteria on with genetic algorithms in order to optimize the decisions of localization, in this perspective we opted for the method of PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization for Method of Enrichment Evaluation), which has made it possible to obtain the best compromise between the various visions and various points of view.","[Alijo, Myriem; Abdoun, Otman; Bergam, Amal] AbdelmalekEssaadi Univ, Polydisciplinary Fac, Larache, Morocco; [Bachran, Mostafa] Mohamed 5 Univ, Lastimi Est Sale, Rabat, Morocco",Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan; Mohammed V University in Rabat,"Alijo, M (通讯作者)，AbdelmalekEssaadi Univ, Polydisciplinary Fac, Larache, Morocco.",alijomyriem90@gmail.com; abdoun.otman@gmail.com; bachrane@gmail.com; bergamamal11@gmail.com,"Abdoun, Otman/AAG-5172-2020; Abdoun, Otman/AAN-8804-2020","Abdoun, Otman/0000-0002-9580-8955",,,,,14,0,0,1,2,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The Washington Consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme, is being encroached on by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this latter method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives. This is increasingly evident because China's economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve it. A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The article puts some structure on China's economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of theWashington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the twenty-first century and beyond, theWashington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyo's (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.","[Asongu, Simplice A.; Aminkeng, Gilbert A.

Transport represents one of the important factors that can influence visitors' decision-making concerning the choice of the destination. However, transport doesn't serve only for transfer of visitors. Transport itself can be an important tourist attraction. Transport issues solving is thus an important task for destination management. The paper deals with the problems of transport just from the destination management perspective. It examines theoretical background of the relation between transport and tourism and aims to map the role of transport in present destination management. The attention is paid to the situation in the Czech Republic, in its particular regions, by means of a surrey via questionnaire among existing destination management organizations.

A substantive value valuation method was applied to assess the construction company value for the purpose of this research and simulation was carried out to analyse the impact of the interest on different amount of savings. A substantive value valuation method took into account both the reproduction cost and accounting values. Furthermore, different types of savings were considered, i.e. saved financial resources on (1) a term account without commitment and (2) with 1-year commitment. These two variants were compared with the valuation of the company in real time (zero variant). Savings were achieved through year-on-year decrease in inventory since decreasing the inventory level is one of the first decisions a company makes during economic crisis. Real construction company operating on the Czech construction market was selected as a subject of analysis for the case study. Data shows considerable deviations in terms of company value during the economic crisis (2008- 2015). Furthermore, results have revealed that the analysed interest on savings impact on the construction company value is minimal.

An empirical analysis of the impact of FDI and other indicators of technological transfer on the export structure was performed. We consider three export groups of technology-intensive manufactures: high-, medium- and low skill and one export group of labor and resource-intensive manufactures.The analysis includes a panel framework covering seven CEECs (Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) over the period of 2001-2016. OLS with pooled data, panel data with fixed effects and dynamic panel-data model were used as principal methods. Our results mostly reflect the prediction of the Flying Geese Model (FGM) and GVC theory in terms of: (i) stimulating effect of FDI on high-skill and technology-intensive manufactures; (ii) significance of impact of technology transfer through technological import growth for all export sectors; (iii) important contribution of EU integration to technological development of CEECs.","[Cherkas, Nataliia] Kyiv Natl Econ Univ, Dept Int Econ, Pr Peremogy 54-1, UA-03057 Kiev, Ukraine; [Chekh, Myroslava] Lviv Univ Trade & Econ, Dept Int Econ Relat, 10 Tuhan Baranovskiy Str, UA-79008 Lvov, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Kyiv National Economic University named after Vadym Hetman; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv University of Trade & Economics,"Cherkas, N (通讯作者)，Kyiv Natl Econ Univ, Dept Int Econ, Pr Peremogy 54-1, UA-03057 Kiev, Ukraine.",natsanex@gmail.com; mirachekh@gmail.com,"Cherkas, Nataliia/AAD-9350-2020","Cherkas, Nataliia/0000-0002-8921-1589",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,50,59,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.05,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700005,0

Achieving social justice at the present stage is the establishment of generally binding rules of conduct which strengthen market relations being the economic foundation of Russia and providing its economic development. The urgent character of addressing this topic is due to the fact that neither in science, nor in theory, nor in practice, has there been a uniform understanding of the content of the justice concept and the principles of its implementation in the legal regulation of economic relations and application in practical entrepreneurial activities. In the modern economy justice is more and more often said: in the context of bona fides of business entities, without a violation of the balance of interests (status quo) in conditions of free competition, non-admission of monopolistic activity, provision of tax preferences from the state. The variety of forms of doing business and the absence of clear criteria, including legislative ones, of the principle of social justice of business entities creates the need for a deeper research of this problem.

The study focuses on the differences between Eastern versus Western European customers. More specifically, two main hypotheses were formulated: (1) The self-perception of customers about ethics (concerning ethical, ecological and social issues) is different in Eastern and Western Europe; (2) The mean of customers' reaction on unethical behaviour of the companies is different in Eastern and Western Europe. A quantitative study was conducted through hypothesis tests. The empirical study involved a sample of two-hundred-and-two responses from customers from different countries from Europe and Post-Soviet era countries as well. The findings suggest there are differences between Eastern and Western European customers as their reactions on unethical behaviour differ. Moreover, the results gave support to the main hypotheses outlined, i.e. that the mean of customer's reaction on unethical behaviour and their self-perceptions are different in East and West Europe. Customers from West Europe rate themselves better and are more prone to react against unethical companies' behaviour. Furthermore, Western consumers are more keen and likely to disclose and diffuse unethical corporate procedures.","[Chouhun, Valeryia; Meneses, Raquel] Univ Porto, FEP, Porto, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Aveiro,"Chouhun, V (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, FEP, Porto, Portugal.",valeryia.chouhun@gmail.com; raquelm@fep.up.pt; hnr@ua.pt,"Meneses, Raquel/K-1975-2012; Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020","Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048",,,,,35,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,605,619,,,,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300067,0

European countries driven by the idea to increase the efficiency of the public administration impose strategies and a new approach to the process of public administration management. This means independence of the managerial function in the public sector, independent governance, quick response, responsiveness of the public administration and empowering responsibility of the administration. The favoring of the discretionary right inflicts the question of the responsibility of the public administration. This creates new models for monitoring the performance and assessment of the public administration that allows strengthening of the administration's responsibility in all categories of titles, including managerial workers. In the Republic of Macedonia, the new model for public management is difficult to be accepted, regardless of the fact that legislator made changes to the administrative laws in the approach of assessment and accountability of the administration. In the European countries, the new public management is more acceptable as an indication of the fact that in many European countries the central government conveys the function of managing the public administration as an independent function of the local governments. Moreover, the local authorities are free to create payment systems, regulate the assessment process and to motivate the administrative officials. Hence, the subject of this paper is to understand the role and significance of the new public management in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as to make a comparative analysis with the European countries. Hence, this research paper aims to impose an opinion on the significance of the new public management and whether it contributes to the efficiency of the work of the public administration. The research methodology is based on an analysis of research results and strategies adopted by the European countries. In addition, the paper analyzes the administrative laws and bylaws with an assessment of the new public management. The results of the research point to the conclusion that the new public management is not recognized in all European countries, and that the Republic of Macedonia, is not familiar with the new public management. However, basic legal solutions can be explored that leave the possibility for the application of the new managerial management. There is a necessity of comprehensive analysis of the work and development of the public sector in the Republic of Macedonia, the obligation for a serious approach of the law implementation and a reduction of the resistance to the changes by the employees in the public sector.","[Denkova, Jadranka] GoceDelcev Univ, Krste Misirkov 10-A 2000, Stip, Macedonia; [Lazarevski, Pande] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Inst Sociol Polit & Jurid Res, Partizanski Odredi Bb, Skopje 1000, Macedonia; [Denkova, Branka] Marketing Co, 118 3-9 Jane Sandanski Blvd, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Denkova, J (通讯作者)，GoceDelcev Univ, Krste Misirkov 10-A 2000, Stip, Macedonia.",jadranka.denkova@ugd.edu.mk; pande.lazarevski2@gmail.com; brankad_1@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1201,1208,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200102,0

It focuses on the roles that childcare and household composition play in the employment decisions of prime-age married individuals of Muslim and non-Muslim ethnicity. Using the 2012 China Household Ethnicity Survey (CHES), the study finds that children generally decrease women's likelihood of employment outside the home and increase men's. The gender gap in the probability of off-farm employment is larger for those of Muslim ethnicity. Non-Muslim parents of sons are more likely to migrate for employment than parents of daughters. The presence of women of grandparent age (46-70) universally facilitates labor migration. Men of grandparent age tend to increase only the probability that non-Muslim parents migrate for employment. Additional adult male household members reduce the likelihood that women of Muslim ethnicity have off-farm employment.","[Ding, Sai] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Econ & Social Dev, Inst Ethnol & Anthropol, Bldg 6,27 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Maurer-Fazio, Margaret] Bates Coll, Econ, 276 Pettengill Hall,4 Andrews Rd, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of Winnipeg,"Ding, S (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Econ & Social Dev, Inst Ethnol & Anthropol, Bldg 6,27 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",dingsai@cass.org.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; mmaurer@bates.edu,,,,,,,37,7,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Leakage negates some emission reductions from the regulated regions. We use detailed electricity generation and transmission data to show that this is the case for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a CO2 cap-and-trade program for the electricity sector in select Northeastern U.S. states. More specifically, our results indicate that RGGI induced a reduction in coal-fired generation in RGGI states and an increase in NGCC generation in RGGI-surrounding regions.

In spite of its importance, small business faces many problems. As a result, according to some estimates, about 30% of new small businesses stop running during two years, and about 50% - within five years; according to other estimates - about 60% of businesses get closed during three years. These circumstances cause growth interest in various aspects of the development of small and medium businesses from the scientific community. At present higher flow of information in all fields emphasizes the necessity to identify methods and approaches to optimize its structure and determine key researches. The purpose of this article is to set out perspective directions in reviewing the development of small and medium business based on the bibliometric analysis. The study used the following methods and tools: a) CiteSpaceV program, which allowed to define the perspective directions of researches on the basis of a co-citation method and to visualize research fronts; b) the semantic analysis methods, which allowed to define the directions of researches on the frequency of used terms. The scientific publications presented on Web of science and Russian Science Citation Index from 2010 to 2016 formed information base of a research. The study revealed the main directions in the area of entrepreneurship of small and medium businesses that include market orientation, international entrepreneurship, innovative knowledge, financial crisis, data quality factor, and social responsibility. The results show that there are considerable differences between the directions of researches of the Russian scientists and the world scientific community. Russian publications are more aimed at theoretical rather than practical research. A bid internal problem is the absence of feasible space of knowledge, uniting scientific schools, competence centers, scientific centers and working groups. The study investigates the causes of the gaps in the field of small and medium businesses studies. Comparison of research fronts on foreign publications with Russian subjects may form a basis of forecasting perspective research directions.","[Filimonova, Natalia] Vladimir State Univ, 87 Gorkogo St, Vladimir 600000, Russia; [Starikova, Tatiana] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, 59 Gorkogo St, Vladimir 600017, Russia; [Clark, Dina] Bloomsburg Univ Penn, 400 E 2nd St, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA",Vladimir State University; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania,"Filimonova, N (通讯作者)，Vladimir State Univ, 87 Gorkogo St, Vladimir 600000, Russia.",natal_f@mail.ru; startv008@rambler.ru; timofeeva_dina@mail.ru,"Filimonova, Natalia Mikhailovna/J-3577-2013; Filimonova, Natalia/IVV-4266-2023; Filimonova, Natalia/AAL-3595-2021",,,,,,13,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,295,303,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200027,0

The purpose of the paper is to analyze the enterprise value determinants, in order to help the interested parties, make correct (investment) decisions by studying cases of mergers and acquisitions, as it was the case of ArcelorMittal (Galati). The current status quo of the Romanian steel mill, which was in difficulty before the privatization, is a company in the aftermath of a divestment decision. The research questions refer to the understanding of the relation between the enterprise value and market capitalization of the selected companies acting in the steelmaking field, including other factors (such as the ownership structure). In order to understand how the enterprise value is determined, I have analyzed relevant theories, including Tobin's Quotient (q) for a company/ aggregate corporation, for the study of the relation between the market value and its replacement value. If used empirically, Tobin's q helps avoid issues of estimating shareholders' risk-adjusted required return by the market prices. Besides using the graphical visualization of the share price, I have used the datasets available for several years on the value of several mature steel producing companies, market capitalization and other indicators. The methodology also includes Market Comparable method and own spreadsheet calculations. After analyzing the evolution of the share price for the global steelmaking leader (ArcelorMittal), between 2009 and 2018, I have not identified any growth potential; the market value of ArcelorMittal is a proxy for the market value of its assets. For the target price of ArcelorMittal, the calculated odds of ArcelorMittal to move above current price is about 31.89%, based on normal probability distribution (the probability density function to fall within a particular range of prices over 60 days).","[Ion(Manu), Viorica Madalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 11 Tache Ionescu St,Floor 1,Room 8102, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ion, VM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 11 Tache Ionescu St,Floor 1,Room 8102, Bucharest, Romania.",mvmadalina@yahoo.com,"Manu, Mădălina Viorica/N-9722-2019","Manu, Mădălina Viorica/0000-0002-1516-3668",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,242,250,,,,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200022,0

Our findings support the rejection of the set hypothesis, when analysing the high dimensional insurance industry data with a method from the neural networks family. While four groups of European countries are identified, none of the clusters can be considered as part of EU mainstream. In addition to the EU integration process, there may be some other factors that influence the economic performance and fragmentation of the European insurance industry and the country's relative position within the European insurance market on dynamic topographic maps.

The progressive process of modernizing consumption in Europe causes a change in the consumption pattern. According to this process, the consumption of luxury goods plays a more and more significant role in the consumption structure. The conducted study is the basis for checking whether this process is reflected in all European countries. In particular, this analysis is to check whether and to what extent there was an increase in the share of consumption of luxury goods in total consumption in each of the countries in the analyzed period. The analysis of the diversification of the consumption structure in the countries in the entire period is carried out using the cluster analysis method that allows the identification of territorial units with similar characteristics in this matter.

However, these views are often combined, so the use of those models are only for whole economies. The effects within individual regions may be different, due to the decreasing countryside population. The approach for the solution is to build upon the classic Solow growth model. This progress helps to identify critical variables for the next solution. All calculations are examined within individual regions of the Czech Republic. The results are then compared. The sales of paper are the definition of the factors that affect economic growth in the Czech Republic. The paper is the primary focus of these factors (technology - research and development).

Preferences can be granted on the basis of most favoured nation (MFN) rules of origin anyway. Empirical literature suggests that, if the purpose for enacting preferential rules of origin was to facilitate commerce or promote inward investment, then their implementation has in practice defeated the purpose. Beneficiaries of preferences often prefer to trade using MFN rules of origin, rather than going though cumbersome procedures to show that they can 'benefit' from preferential rules. Thus, in the end, preferential rules of origin are neither necessary for preferences to be granted, nor have they facilitated trade or investment. Our policy recommendation for the negotiators of the Harmonized Working Programme (HWP), which aims to establish common rules of origin for all WTO members, is to also decide to outlaw preferential rules of origin.","[Mavroidis, Petros C.] Columbia Law Sch, Law, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mavroidis, Petros C.] Univ Neuchatel, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Vermulst, Edwin] VVGB Advocaten, Brussels, Belgium",Columbia University; University of Neuchatel,"Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, Law, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Mavroidis, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Neuchatel, Switzerland.",pm2030@columbia.edu; edwin.vermulst@vvgb-law.com,,,,,,,28,9,9,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

However, the explanatory power of a composite indicator is strongly influenced by the methodology of its construction, which is comprised of several necessary steps: development of theoretical framework, identification and development of suitable variables, standardisation of variables, weighting variables individually and in groups (two-step approach to weighting is typical), and finally conducting sensitivity tests on the robustness of aggregated variables. Our first aim is to analyse differences in countries' ranking depending on using different standardising approaches. We will apply different methods of standardising variables (standard deviation from the mean, distance from the group leader, distance from the mean, distance from the best and worst performers) and evaluate the changes in countries' ranking. Our second objective is to compare the performance of the EU Member States and to identify competitive advantages and disadvantages of individual countries. Our analysis and comparison are based on the modified Porter's Diamond Model.

This, in turn, translates into a reduction in the ability to conduct any business activity, as well as affects the increase in prices and impoverishment of the society. All of this in turn affects the public mood and the widely understood state of security in a given area. The Great War, as the World War I was then called, was the first global military clash between two significant military-political blocs. Its economic effects were extremely large for Europeans, regardless of the country. Everywhere, it triggered inflation, the rationing of basic necessities and the need to co-finance armaments by citizens. However, not everywhere, the course of the war and its economic consequences were identical, which resulted even from the fact of the existence or non-existence of the phenomenon of occupation. This article is intended to show what economic conse-quences are caused by war and occupation in micro-regional terms. The main re-search problem is the analysis of the social and economic life of the population of the third largest city in the province of Galicja, Stanislavov (Austro-Hungarian Empire), during the First World War. For this reason, the then state of industry, the level of development of trade and services, and the devastating impact of military activities on the economic progress of the city and its residents were analyzed. The article also draws attention to the process of gradual impoverishment of inhabitants resulting from the ongoing military operations, lasting for long periods of occupation and or-ders issued by the occupation administration that focused on plundering state assets belonging to the Habsburg Empire and charging the population with the costs of maintaining the occupation army. At the same time, the initiatives of the civil (au-tochthonous) city authorities, which sought to counteract all the negative effects of the occupation, were pointed out. The work is characterized by a chronological-problem approach to content. The initial conquest is the outbreak of World War I, and the final end of the war in November 1918.

In case of a accomplishing a web service from a cloud paradigm, the intricacy arises in processing the vast amount of information within a stipulated amount of time.

In addition, effectual performance of the entire system gets degraded out offurnishing request in view of precedent user rating alone in an implicit way. In order to surmount over the issue of accomplishing an unrelated web service from a search engine, an inventive approach devised as Distance based Agglomerative Clustering and Secure Service Recommendation (DAC-SSR). A robust form of subset formulation via user-item and item-item similarity promotes the existence of resourceful associative similarity in between that user query and web service. Preprocessed dataset fed to the consecutive models comprises of various domains and proceed with the distance based agglomerative clustering.

In today's post-crisis conditions of the ongoing recession and the effects of economic sanctions Russian regions are faced with serious social, economic and environmental negative impacts of economic activity: the depletion of the natural resource factor and, as a consequence, declining in quality of life of the population. These problems are particularly acute in the environmental-economic systems where natural resources act as a system-forming factor. The main management task for such environmental-economic systems with low stability is the development of management mechanisms, aimed at the preservation and rational use of the main (and sometimes only) production resource of the area. The article proposes a classification based on the degree of internal stability of economic systems. Authors propose a unified approach to mechanism developing by identifying the impact factors (using PEST + E analysis), creating the signed digraph of interfactoral interactions and graph connectivity matrix of the dynamics of the main factor interaction, EES state model with indicator assessment (the vertices) as well as environmental monitoring and monitoring of socioeconomic development of the territory based on unified methodology system.

The roles of the university changed across history enumerating titles as: moral symbols, social etalons, education providers and innovation facilitators, promoters of entrepreneurial talent, economic and civic leaders and mostly as knowledge pioneers. Throughout the content of this paper we argue, in the first section, the major roles that the university played across time, the ones that it presently performs and we forecast its future powers. Within the second section of the paper we connect the paradigm of the ?earning organization' with the strategic knowledge management model for transforming the potential of the university (in terms of intellectual, financial, material resources) into operational (pragmatic) results. The undeniable strategic advantage of universities is that they can equally provide information and knowledge to both the private and the public domain. Debating about the options of transforming a university into a learning organization will provide new directions for the university leaders in order to increase their value creation for society. Throughout the third section of the paper we will present 'the University agenda for developing students' skills in the knowledge economy'. Under this section we approached the major shifts on the labor market regarding the employability skills. Further we provide argumentation for the most wanted categories of skills in the time horizon of 2030, which are considered to be: fluency of ideas, judgement and decision making, originality, active learning, system evaluation, learning strategies, complex problem solving, critical thinking, system analysis, deductive reasoning.

Thereby, the dynamics of political systems in terms of instability and uncertainty concern the political address of governments and political majority. Following a strategy-structure paradigm, political systems drive the effective functioning of public management and public administration. Following a historical path and excursus, the aim of this study is to elucidate how political discontinuity and uncertainty are sources for sustainability driving public management to face and solve problems over time. Despite the increasing attention for public leadership in complex environment, research neglected the effects of policy and organizational changes on public management behaviors. Political system in Italy has known over the years frequent government turnovers, making the government average institutional life very short. Horovitz, Hoff and Milanovic (2009) define political instability as a basic source of variation in institutions and practices (... whose) frequency and character depend on voter preferences, political institutions, and salient events and issues (p. 107). Political instability depending on frequent government turnovers entails both a leadership change - which is based on a change in the institutional parties that constitute a majority coalition - and an ideology change - when the new majority coalition expresses a substantially new ideology. This paper elucidates a discussion on how change in the public administration environment could create a perceived uncertainty among top-managers whose assignment will end with the collapse of the government. This uncertainty affects their competencies (i.e. the motivation to lead), in terms of efforts they exert to perform their high level administrative leadership duties, and on planning activity, in terms of the goal's difficulty related to their projects or executive programs.","[Romanelli, Mauro; De Gennaro, Davide; Buonocore, Filomena] Univ Naples Parthenope, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Romanelli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",mauro.romanelli@uniparthenope.it; davide.degennaro@uniparthenope.it; filomena.buonocore@uniparthenope.it,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1209,1219,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200103,0

Seminal work by Bell and Slaughter is cited to answer the question about why current generations should care about future generations. A new set of twelve obligations that current generations have to future generations is presented that reflects contemporary threats and issues. For example, this set explicitly communicates that current generations have an obligation to reduce threats of human extinction from a combination of risks such as climate change, pandemics, and nuclear war. It is also argued that current generations have an obligation to be stewards of what is means to be human and what the very nature of nature is against advances and unwitting implementations of emerging technologies. it is argued that current generations also have obligations to protect human knowledge from being lost over time and generating new knowledge to support survival into the distant future. A new institution, the Intergenerational Panel on Obligations (IGPO), is proposed to measure how well the obligations are being met. A second new institution, World Court of Generations (WCG), is proposed to judge whether current generations are meeting their obligations to future,generations and if not, what level of actions are needed to rectify matters.

The paper is based on results from a survey of 463 respondents, which was conducted in 2016 using an e-questionnaire. Small and medium-sized businesses were compared with large enterprises. SMEs believe that their main advantage against large enterprises are ability to meet individual customer wishes. As the largest weakness is seen a significant impact of unpaid receivables. Other significant negative effects belonged changes in legislation, more vulnerable of the surrounding, threats from large businesses, for example, when they sell at the predatory prizes, small financial and bargaining power. The research included a comparison of claims in the literature with the opinion of SMEs. The literature states that SMEs are making only minor innovations, but only 9.3 % of respondents agree with this statement.

Schools facing pressure to improve academic outcomes may reallocate their efforts in ways that have unintended consequences for children's health. To examine the impact of school accountability, we create a unique panel dataset containing school-level data on test scores and students' weight outcomes from schools in Arkansas. We code schools as facing accountability pressures if they are on the margin of making Adequate Yearly Progress, measured by whether the school's minimum-scoring subgroup had a passing rate within 5 percentage points of the threshold. We find evidence of small effects of accountability pressures on the percent of students at a school who are overweight. This finding is little changed if we controlled for the school's lagged rate of overweight, or use alternative ways to identify schools facing NCLB pressure.","[Anderson, Patricia M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Butcher, Kristin F.] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA; [Schanzenbach, Diane Whitmore] Northwestern Univ, Sch Educ & Social Policy, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Dartmouth College; Wellesley College; Northwestern University,"Schanzenbach, DW (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Educ & Social Policy, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",patricia.m.anderson@dartmouth.edu; kbutcher@wellesley.edu; dws@northwestern.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [57922]; Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College Reiss Family Faculty Research Grant; Wellesley College Faculty Award,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College Reiss Family Faculty Research Grant; Wellesley College Faculty Award,"We thank Jannine Riggs, Denise Airola, and Jim Boardman of the Arkansas Department of Education for helpful discussions about the Arkansas education data and accountability rules.

Hearing, vision and cognitive disorders are common chronic conditions amongst older Europeans and recent studies have documented its high co-occurrence. While it has been shown separately that suffering either mental disorders or sensory (hearing and vision) impairments is associated with higher health care utilisation, the association between health care utilisation and the interaction of these conditions has received little attention in the literature. Therefore, using four waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this study applies the correlated random effects method to the negative binomial and finite mixture models to analyse the extent to which the interaction of cognitive and sensory impairments is associated with health care use. We found that individuals with cognitive impairment tend to have more hospitalisations. The finite mixture approach indicates a positive association between sensory impairment and the number of hospitalisations amongst low users of health care. Additionally, our findings suggest a positive association between suffering both impairments at the same time and the number of doctor and GP visits.","[Lugo-Palacios, David G.] Univ Manchester, Ctr Hlth Econ, 4 306 Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Gannon, Brenda] Univ Queensland, Fac Business Econ & Law, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Manchester; University of Queensland,"Lugo-Palacios, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Ctr Hlth Econ, 4 306 Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",david.lugopalacios@manchester.ac.uk,"; Gannon, Brenda/D-2011-2017","Lugo-Palacios, David G./0000-0003-2621-5627; Gannon, Brenda/0000-0002-3672-4030",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [668648],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020),"This research is part of the Work Package 4 of the SENSE-Cog project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 668648.

There are numerous factors influencing these mixed econometric results, including selection biases and inconsistent definitions or methods, and the global literature is limited to selected geographies. This paper seeks to address these gaps by analyzing an original data set collected as part of a prospective impact evaluation of a reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) program in eastern Zambia funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Drawing on survey data from 2822 households and supplemented with contextual and spatially-derived statistics, we seek to answer two questions: (i) what household and village characteristics explain variation in perceived forest tenure security, which we define to mean relatively unchallenged access to forest resources? and (ii) is more secure forest tenure, as perceived by forest users, associated with better reported forest condition? We aim to contribute more reliable evidence to the global literature linking community-level land tenure and forest condition by using improved proxies for (de facto) local forest tenure and land governance and filling a gap in the geographic coverage. Overall, we find that more secure de facto forest tenure is associated with localized (village level) customary governance. We also find that more secure de facto forest tenure is associated with better reported forest condition. Our results highlight the need to understand local accountability in existing customary governance structures in the context of designing and enforcing REDD+ agreements. We expect our more nuanced assessment of de facto forest tenure security to inform policies to promote sustainable forest management, including through REDD+ and community-based forest management, particularly in forest contexts where customary rights remain relevant.","[Stickler, M.

With a field experiment conducted in Bihar (India), we estimate the price sensitivity of demand for diagnostic testing of drinking water wells for arsenic of natural origin - a serious threat to the health of tens of millions of villagers across South and Southeast Asia. Demand is substantial but sensitive to price; uptake falls from 68% to 31% of households over our price range (Rs. 10 to Rs. 50). We further asess how households respond to information regarding the contamination level in their wells. About one-third of households with unsafe wells switch to a safer water source. Finally, we demonstrate that households that received adverse test outcomes are more likely to selectively forget test results, and proactively remove evidence of their wells' arsenic status.

We show that the higher biomass demand for energy needed to reach the 2 degrees C target can be achieved without significant distortions to woody biomass material use and that it can even benefit certain forest industries and regions. This is because the higher woody biomass use for energy increases the demand for forest industry by-products, which makes forest industry final products production more profitable and compensates for the cost effect of increased competition over raw materials. The higher woody biomass use for energy is found to benefit sawnwood, plywood and chemical pulp production, which provide large amounts of by-products, and to inhibit fiberboard and mechanical pulp production, which provide small amounts of by-products. At the regional level, the higher woody biomass use for energy is found to benefit material production in regions, which use little roundwood for energy (Russia, North-America and EU28), and to inhibit material production in regions, which use large amounts of roundwood for energy (Asia, Africa and South-America). Even if the 2 degrees C target increases harvest volumes in the tropical regions significantly compared to the non-mitigation scenario, harvest volumes remain in these regions at a relatively low level compared to the harvest potential.","[Lauri, Pekka; Forsell, Nicklas; Korosuo, Anu; Havlik, Petr; Obersteiner, Michael] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Nordin, Annika] Swedish Univ Agr SLU, Umea, Sweden",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Lauri, P (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",pekka.lauri@iiasa.ac.at,"Nordin, Annika/IQS-3733-2023","Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085; Forsell, Nicklas/0000-0002-4984-3231; Obersteiner, Michael/0000-0001-6981-2769","Future Forests; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); Swedish Forestry Industry; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Umea University; Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk); CRESENDO project (Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, Knowledge, Dissemination and Outreach) [641816]; CD-LINKS project (Linking Climate and Development Policies-Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing) [642147]","Future Forests; Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA); Swedish Forestry Industry; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Umea University; Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk); CRESENDO project (Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, Knowledge, Dissemination and Outreach); CD-LINKS project (Linking Climate and Development Policies-Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing)","This study was financially supported by Future Forests.

To our knowledge, Harstad (2012) is the only study on SIEAs, in which countries purchase fossil-energy deposits to prevent their exploitation. He finds that for any coalition size there exists a (small) subset of parameters, different for each size, such that the coalition of that size is stable. However, the comparison of Harstad's results with the prevailing demand-side SIEA analyses is hampered by major differences in the structure of the respective game models. This paper develops a game model with a deposit market and deposit purchases for preservation that is in line with some demand-side SIEA literature. It turns out that either no coalition is stable or the grand coalition is the only stable coalition. We compare the outcome of our model not only with Harstad's model but also with Eichner and Pethig's (2015) model of the formation of SIEAs in which climate policy takes the form of (demand-side) emissions taxes.

We find that cheap natural gas has shuffled the marginal fuel in different ways in different regions, changing the marginal emissions profile. The impact of cheap natural gas varies across U.S. regions as a function of the existing stock of electricity generation. We demonstrate the impact of these changes on the environmental benefits of energy policy by simulating the installation of wind and solar generating capacity in different regions around the U.S. We construct an hourly data set of potential renewable generation for both wind and solar power and combine that with our estimated marginal emissions. CO2 emissions offset by wind generation are around 6% lower on average, and emissions offset by solar generation are essentially flat, although the average hides significant variation across regions.

While a few studies have examined its implementation at a local level, the literature is thus far lacking detailed analyses of how forestry professionals perceive and implement the integration of multiple demands towards public forests, as well as what factors are influencing local level decision-making. This study attempts to fill this gap. Focusing on nature conservation aspects and their integration into public forest management, where a primary objective is timber production, we examine the implementation of integrated forest management in five German Lander (German federal states) as perceived by state forest enterprise rangers (Revierleiter). Our findings indicate a great willingness and commitment among forest rangers to implement integrative nature conservation approaches through integrated forest management. However, there are also a number of factors that hinder their implementation. In particular there is a mismatch between the demands placed on rangers and the support provided to them regarding time, more flexible timber targets, and financial as well as personnel resources.

A generalised approach to mediation analysis,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mediation analysis; Intergenerational mobility; Equality of opportunity,MOBILITY; ABILITY,"We seek to quantify the role of education as a mechanism through which family background affects economic outcomes. To this end, we generalise mediation analysis to allow for multidimensional treatments. This improves the validity of mediation analysis for our application, in which family background is exogenous and multidimensional. Our approach allows the mediating role of education to vary across background characteristics, whilst also estimating its overall mediating effect. We estimate that educational attainment explains 21%-37% of the family background effect on hourly earnings in Australia, and only 13%-19% of the effect on wealth. We argue that these estimates are likely upward-biased. Therefore the link between family background and economic outcomes operates mostly through other mechanisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We reflect on challenges and opportunities faced by a 'boundary organisation' that interfaces between science and policy, taking as example the European Commission's Directorate General Joint Research Centre, whose mission is stated as that to be the in-house science service. We suggest that such an institution can be exemplary as to what could be changed to improve the quality of evidence feeding into the policy processes in the European Union. This paper suggests how an in-house culture of reflexivity and humility could trigger changes in the existing styles and methods of scientific governance; at the JRC, taken as example, this would mean opening up to the existing plurality of norms and styles of scientific inquiry, and adopting more participatory approaches of knowledge production, assessment and governance. We submit that the institutional changes advocated here are desirable and urgent in order to confront the ongoing erosion of trust in 'evidence based policy', anticipating controversies before they become evident in the institutional setting in which institutions operate.

However, little has been said about its procedure costs, owing to a dearth of related cost studies. This study helps fill this research gap by analyzing the execution costs of WGS within the setting of German clinical practice. First, to estimate costs, a sequencing process related to clinical practice was undertaken. Once relevant resources were identified, a quantification and monetary evaluation was conducted using data and information from expert interviews with clinical geneticists, and personnel at private enterprises and hospitals. This study focuses on identifying the costs associated with the standard sequencing process, and the procedure costs for a single WGS were analyzed on the basis of two sequencing platforms-namely, HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq Xten, both by Illumina, Inc. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of various uses of sequencing platforms and various coverage values on a fixed-cost degression. In the base case scenario-which features 80 % utilization and 30-times coverage-the cost of a single WGS analysis with the HiSeq 2500 was estimated at a,notsign3858.06. The cost of sequencing materials was estimated at a,notsign2848.08; related personnel costs of a,notsign396.94 and acquisition/maintenance costs (a,notsign607.39) were also found. In comparison, the cost of sequencing that uses the latest technology (i.e., HiSeq Xten) was approximately 63 % cheaper, at a,notsign1411.20. The estimated costs of WGS currently exceed the prediction of a 'US$1000 per genome', by more than a factor of 3.8. In particular, the material costs in themselves exceed this predicted cost.","[Ploethner, Marika; Frank, Martin; von der Schulenburg, J. -Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Plöthner, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",mp@cherh.de,,,,,,,42,22,22,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The resulting harvests within each planning period are then typically scattered over the area. In practical forestry, clustering harvests is seen as important, but tools for planning harvest clustering applicable for practical level planning are largely missing. In previous studies, clustering harvests has been seen as an objective in itself rather than means to save costs. It has thus not been possible to define an optimal level for clustering in Order to maximize the NPV. In this study, clustering is carried out by minimizing the total opening costs (TOCs) for harvest sites. TOC is defined as a fixed cost for one contiguous harvest cluster. It consists of e.g. transferring the machines to the harvest site, waiting time for the machinery and Workers due to the transfer, delineation of the harvest site and administrative work required for each harvest site. Our results show that with small opening cost, it is optimal to follow the strategic level plan, while as the operiing cost increases it iS optimal to make larger and larger harvest clusters. The clustering also affects the treatments carried out: with high opening costs the harvests in some stands will be postponed for 10 years or more, or the treatment may change from the strategic level optimum.

A significant probability that many other civilizations have been in our situation but failed to become spacefaring increases the probability that our optimal existential risk strategies are costly, likely to fail, likely to leave traces if they do fail, and might require talents that mankind has but that other scientifically advanced species lack. The Fermi paradox implies that we should seek scientific data based on astronomical observations not accessible to civilizations that lived in the distant past, and that we should create machines to flood our galaxy with radio signals conditional on our civilization's collapse. Our ability to use Bayesian updating on the Fermi paradox reduces the chance that aliens exist but are hiding from us because of their desire to not interfere in our development: giving us a false understanding of the fate of intelligent life in the universe would cloud our understanding of existential risks. The paradox also provides clues as to types of trap that might destroy us. The possibility that our universe is fine-tuned not only for life but also for the Fermi paradox magnifies these results.

In the past few years, social media has become globally popular, and its use is ubiquitous among students. As such, some instructors have incorporated social media into their courses to engage students. Others are reluctant to embrace social media, citing privacy concerns, social media being more of a distraction than a useful tool, and the challenge of keeping up with social media developments, among others.

The paper envisages the tax system development regularity as a dynamic system within various forms of economies. The methods of dialectics were applied in this article such as induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis as well as logic approach to noesis. Theoretic and methodological basis consists of fundamental works in the catastrophic theory, mathematic simulation, and self-organizing system theory represented in the works of Russian and foreign scientists. Different variants of phase transition from one economic system to another are defined within the present research. The features of each system phase transition within the acknowledged chronology are considered. The key impelling factors for each period are found. The probable development vector of the tax system after the finance crisis in 2018-2020 is determined. The altered economic conditions will require the formation of completely new tax system where the main taxable items will include labor, financial capital and land. The phase transition will presumably last for several decades and will induce high levels of social, politic, and economic instability in the world. The formation transition takes place under the influence of external factors and only at the precise moment when the previous formation has created the necessary conditions for that transition to the next formation.","[Bezrukova, Tatiana L.; Bezrukov, Boris A.] Voronezh State Acad Forestry & Technol, 8 Timiryazeva St, Voronezh, Russia; [Bryantseva, Larisa V.; Orobinskaya, Irina V.; Kazmin, Anton G.] Voronezh State Agr Univ, Voronezh, Russia; [Pozdeev, Valery L.] Volga State Univ Technol, Yoshkar Ola, Russia",Voronezh State University of Forestry & Technologies named after G.F.

While there have been plenty of economic arguments situating it as a financial bubble about to collapse including from Nobel Prize winning economists, its price value has proven to be more durable than many have predicted. To explain this durability, Karpik's conception of market singularities is used to understand the Bitcoin phenomenon by outlining the beliefs that maintain Bitcoin's status as a volatile financial asset. Market singularities are markets for particular kinds of goods and services that are of uncertain and incommensurable value. Singularities markets have communities of followers and a distinctive belief system that ascribes value to a particular product, service, or asset. Developing Karpik's conception, the paper explores the libertarian political belief system that surrounds Bitcoin's status as a financial asset. I also outline some political tensions within the electronic currency community concerning governance and centralisation.","[Dallyn, Sam] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Dallyn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England.",sam.dallyn@manchester.ac.uk,"Dallyn, Sam/O-4938-2015","Dallyn, Sam/0000-0002-3349-5105",,,,,55,26,29,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Determining the causes of inflation requires a thorough analysis to identij) anti-inflationary measures and to assess possible future effects on prices as well. The proposed econometric methods analyze on one hand the impact and the extent to which prices are influenced by monetary factors and production, and by salaries and the exchange rate, on the other hand. We also analyze several models containing the main macroeconomic variables which have a direct impact on inflation and also within these models we find patterns in various economic interdependences. From the six estimated models, only two of them meet the criteria of the VAR method used in our study and the main lessons drawn from data modeling are: the money supply, the index of producer prices and the inflation CORE2 are the main sources of variation in industrial prices; after their own shocks, the monetary factors have a significant impact on prices, primarily on the production prices and later on the industry prices, whereas the salaries and exchange rate have little impact and do not account for the inflation in our country during the investigated period.","[Mitrut, Constatin; Vilcu, Roxana Cristina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Gruiescu, Mihaela] Romanian Amer Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Mitrut, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cmitrut@ase.ro; mgruiescu@yahoo.com; roxanavilcu@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

As the study showed, many citizens of Volgograd consider the issue of wind direction not to be the one that should be taken into account when buying an apartment.

The adverse effects of high indebtedness highlighted the importance of maintaining sustainable public finances. This problem was not limited to rich and highly developed economies. The Republic of Macedonia also experienced such developments in the fiscal area and the public debt ratio doubled in the last decade. The aim of this paper is to investigate the fiscal sustainability of Macedonia using quarterly data for the period 2005 - 2016. We use a VAR model to determine whether the primary balance responds positively to increases in government indebtedness, thus ensuring fiscal sustainability, or is set exogenously and independently from changes in government liabilities. The empirical analysis shows that the primary balance lacks the necessary and sufficient positive response to an increase in the government debt level that helps prevent a further debt accumulation. These results, together with the drastically increased public debt since 2008, imply a need for a faster adjustment of the primary balance after a government debt shock in order to prevent reaching even higher debt levels and losing a valuable fiscal space.","[Tashevska, Biljana; Trenovski, Borce] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje,"Tashevska, B (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Skopje, Macedonia.",biljana@eccf.ukim.edu.mk; borcet@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,"Trenovski, Borce/AAD-7295-2022; Tashevska, Biljana/AAM-6659-2021","Trenovski, Borce/0000-0002-3630-9486; Tashevska, Biljana/0000-0002-6198-9575",,,,,40,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,479,489,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700052,0

This article proposes a simple derivation from the gravity models to analyze the determinants of the quality of imported fruits in China between 1987 and 2012.

The quality elasticity with respect to China's per capita GDP is around 1.96. Rich countries tend to export high-quality fruits to China. Other characteristics of exporting countries such as population size, geographic factors, relative endowment of land, as well as regional trading arrangement also have some impact on the quality of imported fruits in China.","[Tian, Xu] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Gottingen,"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",xyu@uni-goettingen.de,,"Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081; , xu/0000-0002-1070-3581","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473123, 71333008]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This study was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project ID: 71473123 and 71333008), and A Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,56,11,12,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

(b) The three factor model is the best explanation of the data. The behaviors of seeking help from organizations, communication and learning as well as seeking help from individuals are successively important factors influencing the behavior status of rural children. It is suggested that social organizations should play an active role in serving rural children, families and the government should strengthen parenting education in rural areas, and that schools should improve the quality of teachers in rural areas so that the rural children can seek help from organizations and professionals when encountering difficulties.

This article reviews and discusses the alternative views on the causes of the slowdown in accumulation and growth and the policies implemented and proposed to deal with it. It is argued that growing inequality, notably the secular decline in the share of wages, and financialisation are the main factors. Neither spending booms driven by financial bubbles, nor exporting unemployment through trade provides sustainable solutions. It is necessary to rebalance capital and labour, restrain finance and assign a greater role to the public sector in aggregate demand management and income and wealth distribution. However, the dominant neoliberal ideology rules out such socially progressive and economically effective solutions. Consequently, stagnation is likely to remain the new normal in the years to come with governments attempting to reignite growth by creating credit and asset bubbles and/or trying to export unemployment through beggar-thy-neighbour macroeconomic, labour market, trade and exchange rate policies, thereby generating financial and economic instability and tensions in international economic relations with significant repercussions for emerging and developing economies.","[Akyuz, Yilmaz] UNCTAD, Div Globalisat & Dev Strategies, Geneva, Switzerland",,,yilmaz.akyuz@bluewin.ch,,,,,,,70,5,5,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

I also find that a considerable amount of dynamics is due to individuals reducing welfare use, as their stock of remaining welfare eligibility depletes. This generates more plausible predictions related to counterfactuals, cumulative welfare use patterns, and mechanical termination of benefits.","[Chan, Marc K.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Chan, Marc K.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Technology Sydney,"Chan, MK (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Level 4,FBE Bldg,111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia.",marc.chan@unimelb.edu.au,,"Chan, Marc/0000-0002-1010-7587",,,,,39,7,9,0,26,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

The reform redistributed funding across municipalities and determined a minimum spending on teachers. While several papers have already examined the overall effect of the FUNDEF reform, this is the first analysis of the effects of the municipalities' relative positions after the redistribution on hiring decisions. Using a simulated difference-in-differences model, I find that FUNDEF only led to salary increases in municipalities that benefited from the redistribution. Contrary to its initial goal, municipalities harmed by the redistribution responded by increasing hiring. Additionally, employing a simulated instrumental-variable model, I find that the amount received in FUNDEF transfers did not lead to pay increases. Models of government-union interaction are used to explain these results, suggesting that the bargaining power is the main driver of teacher pay.","[Cruz, Tassia] FGV, EPPG, Sch Publ Policy & Govt, SGAN Quadra 602 Modulo A Ave L2, Norte Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Cruz, T (通讯作者)，FGV, EPPG, Sch Publ Policy & Govt, SGAN Quadra 602 Modulo A Ave L2, Norte Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",tassia.cruz@fgv.br,"de Souza Cruz, Tassia/AEU-0516-2022","de Souza Cruz, Tassia/0000-0003-1627-9467",Lemann Center for Brazilian Education at Stanford University,Lemann Center for Brazilian Education at Stanford University,"I am especially grateful to Martin Carnoy for several insightful comments that significantly improved the paper.

Leasing contracts can be expropriated before expiration, albeit at a cost. To minimise transactions costs and avoid the 'resource trap' the government would prefer to enter into an infinitely long contract (i.e. sell the resource), if it could commit not to expropriate. However, with finite costs of expropriation credible commitment is impossible: the government either enters into finite contracts, expropriates with positive probability or does both. The value of the resource to the government is increasing in the cost of expropriation, but decreasing in the variability of the resource rent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, in this paper we compare individuals that enter into the DI system due to a progressive deterioration in the health status (ordinary illness) to similar non-disabled individuals. Our aim is to identify the differences in employment and wages between these two groups before disabled individuals are officially accepted into the DI system. We combine matching models and difference-in-difference and we find that the wage (employment) growth patterns of both groups of workers become significantly different three (five) years before entering the DI system. More specifically, our estimates suggest that 1year before entering the system, there is a difference of 79 Euros/month in the wages of the two groups (8.3% of average wage) as well as a 7.8% point difference in employment probabilities.","[Cervini-Pla, Maria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, EQUALITAS, Barcelona, Spain; [Vall Castello, Judit] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Hlth & Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Castelló, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Hlth & Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",judit.vall@upf.edu,,"Vall castello, Judit/0000-0002-1925-1657; Cervini Pla, Maria/0000-0001-9582-8457",la Caixa Foundation [Promoting the labour market integration of disabled workers: a policy evaluation exercise for Spain] Funding Source: Medline,la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation),,,36,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These peripheral agencies developed new policy instruments and business models that would transform their national economies when scaled by mainstream actors. In this article, we argue that this model is less likely to succeed in an increasingly politicized environment. The growing salience of innovation has instead led to the 'politics of partial success', sharpening the trade-offs between policy experimentation and implementation. We develop these arguments by first reviewing the history of two successful SDAs, the Finnish National Fund for Research and Development and the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist, and then more deeply examining three newly established innovation agencies, Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovative Systems (VINNOVA), and Ireland's Policy Advisory Board for Enterprise and Science (Forfas).","[Breznitz, Dan; Ornston, Darius] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Munk Sch Global Affairs, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Breznitz, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Munk Sch Global Affairs, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada.",dan.breznitz@utoronto.ca,,"Ornston, Darius/0000-0003-2991-7894",American-Scandinavian Foundation; German Marshall Fund of the United States; University of Georgia; University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs; Innovation Policy Lab,American-Scandinavian Foundation; German Marshall Fund of the United States; University of Georgia; University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs; Innovation Policy Lab,"American-Scandinavian Foundation, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the University of Georgia, the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and the Innovation Policy Lab.",,54,19,20,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

WTO members have frequently resorted to antidumping measures in dealing with price distortions caused by the Chinese government's influence on the economy. The Appellate Body's decision in the recent EU-Biodiesel dispute starts to remove the flexibility of condemning state intervention and price distortions under the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement through antidumping measures. This decision, read with the relevant WTO jurisprudence on the ordinary course of trade' test and subsidies, suggests that price distortions resulting from state intervention should be addressed under other WTO rules. Therefore, it is necessary for WTO members to shift their focus to, and explore the capacity of, the other rules to overcome the challenges arising from China's state capitalism.","[Zhou, Weihuan] UNSW Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Zhou, WH (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",weihuan.zhou@unsw.edu.au,"Zhou, Weihuan/HDM-5765-2022",,,,,,37,15,16,2,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2018,17.0,4,,,,,609,633,,10.1017/S1474745617000507,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GX1QX,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447494100003,0

Despite awareness of this problem for several decades, only five interventions have been proposed. In this paper, we increase the number of total possible interventions by more than an order of magnitude. The 64 total interventions involve changing magma characteristics, venting magma, strengthening the cap (rock above the magma), putting more pressure on the magma, stopping an eruption in progress, containing the erupted material, disrupting the plume, or provoking a less intense eruption. We provide qualitative evaluations of the feasibility and risk of 38 of the more promising interventions. The two most promising interventions involve putting more pressure on the magma and delaying the eruption with water dams or soil over the magma chamber. We perform a technical analysis, accurate to within an order of magnitude, and find that water dams and soil and could statistically delay the eruption for a century with 1 and 15 years of effort, respectively. All actions require essentially untested geoengineering challenges along with economic, political and general public acceptance. Further work is required to refine the science, provide cost estimates, and compare cost effectiveness with interventions focusing on adapting to a supereruption.","[Denkenberger, David C.] Tennessee State Univ, 500 John A Merritt Blvd, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Blair, Robert W., Jr.] Ft Lewis Coll, Durango, CO 81301 USA; [Denkenberger, David C.] Global Catastroph Risk Inst, Alliance Feed Earth Disasters, Nashville, TN 37209 USA",Tennessee State University,"Denkenberger, DC (通讯作者)，Tennessee State Univ, 500 John A Merritt Blvd, Nashville, TN 37209 USA.;Denkenberger, DC (通讯作者)，Global Catastroph Risk Inst, Alliance Feed Earth Disasters, Nashville, TN 37209 USA.",david.denkenberger@colorado.edu,"Denkenberger, David/M-1383-2019",,,,,,55,7,7,1,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,51,62,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.002,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900006,0

While areas covered with tropical forests and traditional agricultural crops, such as rubber, are shrinking, oil palm plantations are rapidly gaining ground. Recent studies have analyzed environmental effects of this land-use change. Relatively little is known about the socioeconomic implications. A few studies have examined economic effects of oil palm cultivation for particular groups of households, such as farmers, but broader effects for different types of rural households are not yet well understood. We address this research gap with data from farm and non-farm households in rural Jambi, one of the hotspots of Indonesia's recent oil palm boom. On average, farm households have significantly higher incomes than non-farm households that often work as agricultural laborers on rubber and oil palm plantations. Both farm and non-farm households are better off in villages with a large share of the land under oil palm than in villages where relatively more rubber and other crops are grown. Oil palm does not seem to have significant effects on overall rural inequality. While oil palm cultivation contributes to increasing inequality among farmers, it tends to decrease income inequality among non-farm households through labor-market and employment effects.","[Dib, Jonida Bou; Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Alamsyah, Zulkifli] Univ Jambi, Dept Agr Econ, Jambi 36361, Indonesia",University of Gottingen; Universitas Jambi,"Dib, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jboudib@uni-goettingen.de,"Alamsyah, Zulkifli/AAQ-2384-2021; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Alamsyah, Zulkifli/0000-0003-3927-2524; Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 990]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This study is part of the Collaborative Research Center 'Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Rainforest Transformation Systems in Sumatra, Indonesia' (EFForTS) funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), grant number CRC 990.

In this context, increased logging activities could create new development opportunities for the rural areas in which most of the abandoned stands are situated. This work analyses a forest harvest by creating a model to evaluate its timber value. The economic results were analysed to investigate the structural and logistic factors influencing the profitability of a harvest. The results obtained revealed that a small profit margin is achievable for small local logging companies, even if strongly influenced by the hourly costs of labourers. To quantify the influence of each factor of the model on the timber value, a sensitivity analysis was performed. Then, to test the robustness of the results a Monte Carlo simulation was carried out simultaneously varying the factors involved. Finally, a scenario analysis was performed, in which the standard conditions referring to the most common private forest company typologies were examined. Overall, these methods were found to be suitable for our aims and capable of supplying important results to analyse a forest harvest from an economic perspective.","[Accastello, Cristian; Blanc, Simone; Mosso, Angela; Brun, Filippo] Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, Italy",University of Turin,"Accastello, C (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, Italy.",cristian.accastello@unito.it,"Brun, Filippo/J-1925-2012","Brun, Filippo/0000-0001-5042-1469; BLANC, SIMONE/0000-0002-9725-1804; accastello, cristian/0000-0001-5542-1900",,,,,88,11,11,0,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,36,44,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438180100005,0

The current body of research, however, is characterised by a narrow focus on the global North; moreover, the impact of meso- and macro-level conditions on science-policy interaction is largely ignored. In light of these gaps, the aim of this paper is to highlight enabling factors of 'boundary work' in a developing country context, using South Africa's environment sector as empirical case. The findings are based on qualitative document analysis and expert interviews. Taking the South African National Biodiversity Institute as a starting point, the paper identifies three factors related to the policy domain that seem decisive for its effectiveness: supportive law that constitutes a crucial source of legitimacy for boundary work; the availability of an absorptive administration, which is willing and able to take up expertise; and the existence of a strong science community producing policy-relevant knowledge that deals with the country's specific problems. Without such conducive conditions, the author infers, boundary work in the sector would not have the same level of impact. The paper calls for more research on the context of science-policy interaction, not only but particularly in developing countries.","[Koch, Susanne] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Koch, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",susanne.koch@tum.de,,"Koch, Susanne/0000-0002-6830-9077",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [WE 972/30-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This article draws on research carried out under the auspices of the project (Scientific) Experts in Developing Democracies funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (project reference number WE 972/30-1).

The argument begins by hypothesizing that expansion into space will generate a wide variety of distinct species, many having their own cultural, political, religious, etc. traditions. Next, the paper offers reasons for expecting catastrophic conflicts between different civilizations, both near and far, to be the default outcome. Third, it examines some strategies for mitigating conflict, including (i) the establishment of a cosmic Leviathan that is capable of imposing law and order within the cosmopolitical arena, and (ii) the implementation of policies of deterrence to prevent one civilization from attacking another. Both of these strategies appear problematic, though, due to (a) fundamental physical limitations on the speed of space travel and the transfer of information, and (b) the advanced weaponry that future civilizations will almost certainly have at their disposal. The conclusion is that colonizing our solar system, galaxy, and beyond will engender a Hobbesian predicament in which all actors are perpetually in fear of being destroyed that is, when they aren't engaged in devastating wars with their neighbors.","[Torres, Phil] Project Future Human Flourishing, 849 South 7th St,Apt 4A, Philadelphia, PA 19147 USA",,"Torres, P (通讯作者)，Project Future Human Flourishing, 849 South 7th St,Apt 4A, Philadelphia, PA 19147 USA.",philosophytorres@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,13,13,1,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,JUN,2018,100.0,,,,,,74,85,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.04.008,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GI7ZV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434742500007,0

We model the effects of anticipation on sales and retirements of durable goods, and test our theory's predictions empirically using the 2007 implementation of heavy-duty emission standards. We find evidence that anticipation caused a sales spike just before the policy took effect and a symmetric sales slump after implementation, which resulted in 31,164 more freight-truck sales ahead of the new standard and as much as $118 million in environmental damages over the lifetimes of those vehicles.

Our panel data, drawn from the Eurostat database, cover subregions in 22 European countries, measured at the lowest nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) level for 2000-2013. Applying fixed effects methods, we find a significantly positive and robust effect of the German SCS on the number of patients diagnosed with malignant skin neoplasm. However, the program does not significantly influence the melanoma mortality rate. This finding conflicts with the decreased melanoma mortality rate found for the pilot SCS program in northern Germany. Our results indicate that Germany's nationwide SCS program is effective in terms of a higher diagnosis rate for malignant skin neoplasms and thus may contribute to an improvement in the early detection of skin cancer.","[Kaiser, Micha; Schiller, Joerg; Schreckenberger, Christopher] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Hlth Care & Publ Management, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schreckenberger, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Hlth Care & Publ Management, Stuttgart, Germany.",christopher.schreckenberger@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Schreckenberger, Christopher/0000-0003-2442-0141; Schiller, Joerg/0000-0002-2522-9771",,,,,30,17,18,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Methods: A systematic search was conducted for publications using decision modelling to investigate the cost-effectiveness of NPIs for individuals with dementia. Search was limited to studies in English. Studies were excluded if they evaluated interventions aimed only at caregivers of patients with dementia, or if they only included economic evaluation alongside an RCT without additional modelling. Results: Two primary, five secondary and three tertiary prevention intervention studies were identified and reviewed. Five studies utilised Markov models, with others using discrete event, regression-based simulation, and decision tree approaches. A number of challenging methodological issues were identified, including the use of MMSE-score as the main outcome measure, limited number of strategies compared, restricted time horizons, and limited or dated data on dementia onset, progression and mortality. Only one of the three tertiary prevention studies explicitly considered the effectiveness of pharmacological therapies alongside their intervention. Conclusions: Economic evaluations of NPIs in dementia should utilise purposefully-developed decision models, and avoid models for evaluation of pharmaceuticals. Broader outcome measures could be a way to capture the wide impact of NPIs for dementia in future decision models. It is also important to account for the effects of pharmacological therapies alongside the NPIs in economic evaluations. Access to more localised and up-to-date data on dementia onset, progression and mortality is a priority for accurate prediction.","[Sopina, Elizaveta; Sorensen, Jan] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Econ COHERE, JB Winslows Vej 9, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Sorensen, Jan] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Healthcare Outcomes Res Ctr, Dublin, Ireland",University of Southern Denmark; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland,"Sopina, E (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Econ COHERE, JB Winslows Vej 9, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",lsopina@health.sdu.dk,"Sorensen, Jan/AAN-3738-2020; Sopina, Liza/ABD-3569-2020","Sorensen, Jan/0000-0003-0857-9267; Sopina, Liza (Elizaveta)/0000-0002-2680-6999",,,,,62,13,12,1,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The macroeconomic environmental rebound/backfire is decomposed into three effects - the substitution, wealth, and sectoral reallocation effects. We show that the steady-state pollution stock exhibits a U-shaped relationship with either demand-side or supply-side green promotions. Our calibrated result indicates that in terms of pollution, the macroeconomic rebound effectfor the economy as a whole appears to be substantial. More pronounced rebound effects are present when the elasticity of substitution between the clean- and dirty-good consumption is lower, the labor supply is more elastic, the environmental efficiency of clean goods is lower, and the technology level in the clean-good production is higher. We also show that a pollution rebound can result in a social welfare improvement, implying that the rebound effect somewhat improves economic efficiency, and so policies aimed at mitigating the rebound effect may be counterproductive from a welfare perspective.

Neoliberalisation and globalisation generate and utilise the mobility of both capital and labour. Meanwhile, labour migration is presenting a challenge to the observance of labour rights. Present-day methods of capital accumulation rely on the search for cheap labour and the relocation of production to territories that do not protect workers' rights. Effective defence of labour rights must take place at the transnational level, where most capital is generated. Trade unions need to cross national borders in order to move social activity into this area. The defence of workers' rights must go hand in hand with the struggle against nationalism and racist prejudices. In this context, migrant workers become one of the main potential driving forces of the modern global proletariat.","[Zuk, Piotr] Univ Wroclaw, Dept Sociol, Wroclaw, Poland; [Zuk, Piotr; Zuk, Pawel] Ctr Civil Rights & Democracy Res, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Zuk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Inst Socjol, Ul Koszarowa 3, PL-51149 Wroclaw, Poland.",pzuk@uni.wroc.pl,"Żuk, Piotr/AAP-5929-2021","Zuk, Pawel/0000-0003-1985-6178; Zuk, Piotr/0000-0003-3153-7022",,,,,66,20,20,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Using the scores received by recipients and the funding thresholds, I take advantage of a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal impact of an increase in scholarship amount on locational choice and career outcomes of recipients. First, I find no evidence that recipients are induced to remain in Canada when they are promised a larger scholarship if they study in Canada. Second, there is no evidence that receiving a larger scholarship affects the probability of PhD completion within either five or nine years. Third, there is some evidence that a larger scholarship does increase the probability of having a tenure track academic position nine years after receiving the award by approximately 15 percentage points.

Using a sample of persons born between 1900 and 1925 drawn from nationally representative census microdata, the study investigates the effect of prenatal temperance environment on adult educational outcomes. The quantitative analysis uses proxies for temperance environment: the strength of temperance laws and the density of liquor retailers. In sum, the evidence suggests that men and women exposed to the temperance movement in utero had modestly higher education. The effect on eighth grade completion was weakly significant at best, while the effect on high school completion was robustly significant, though relatively small in magnitude. Estimates imply that the adoption of temperance laws increased the odds of high school completion by about 3-8%, and analogously that the reduction of retail liquor density, to the extent it changed from 1913 to 1921, increased the odds of high school completion by about 4-8%. The findings are consistent with several causal mechanisms including a reduction in fetal alcohol exposure and the adverse developmental outcomes with which it is associated.","[Francis-Tan, Andrew] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Francis-Tan, Andrew] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469B Bukit Timah Rd,02-02, Singapore 259771, Singapore; [Tan, Cheryl] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Zhang, Ruhan] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Emory University; National University of Singapore; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; University of Chicago,"Francis-Tan, A (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;Francis-Tan, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469B Bukit Timah Rd,02-02, Singapore 259771, Singapore.",andrew.francis@nus.edu.sg,,"Francis-Tan, Andrew/0000-0003-4963-9940",,,,,39,0,0,0,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

Using the case of Moody's, a major credit rating agency, this article traces a fundamental paradigm shift in rating practices since the late 1980s. These innovations in credit rating were driven by new calculative models, new kinds of analysts (so-called 'quants'), and an increasingly profit-oriented organizational culture at Moody's, all shaped by an increasingly financialized context. By studying credit rating agencies' historical and current methodological publications and interviewing rating analysts, I show that the rating innovations of the 1980s and 1990s do not simply alter the rating methods or models. More importantly, they entail an entirely different set of epistemological assumptions about the calculability and predictability of the future, representing a fundamental paradigm shift in calculating and defining credit risk. In this framework, risk is not a threat that must be minimized, but a neutral variable that can be calculated, managed and used to generate profits. These structured finance rating practices suggest a high level of control over risk, and imply that knowledge about risk is sufficient to render it unproblematic. This specific culture of credit risk assessment enabled the emergence and exponential growth of structured finance markets, fueling a culture of high-risk investments. This article contributes to the literature on financialization by arguing that financialization occurs both at the level of organizational culture and calculative practices.","[Besedovsky, Natalia] Univ Hamburg, Dept Social Sci, Allende Pl 1, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Besedovsky, N (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Social Sci, Allende Pl 1, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",natalia.besedovsky@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,78,35,41,7,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Neo-classical economic theory would predict a positive association between skill inequality (as measured in student test scores) and earnings inequality, while educational attainment inequality adds little on top of skills inequality. A sociological theory of social closure, however, argues that inequality in educational attainment is more important than skills inequality in the prediction of earnings inequality. Using educational policies as instruments, we find causal effects of skills inequality and educational attainment inequality, suggesting that a simple human capital model is insufficient to explain rising earnings inequalities. Nevertheless, skills inequality appeared a more important predictor of earnings inequality than educational attainment inequality. Some educational policy reforms (like public preschool provision or introducing standardized tests) led to reduced educational dispersions, and thereby reduced earnings inequality in adulthood.","[Checchi, Daniele] Univ Milan, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [van de Werfhorst, Herman G.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Milan; University of Amsterdam,"van de Werfhorst, HG (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",h.g.vandewerfhorst@uva.nl,"Checchi, Daniele/AAL-7289-2020; Checchi, Daniele/AAN-2075-2020; van de Werfhorst, Herman/E-2407-2013","Checchi, Daniele/0000-0001-7466-8562; van de Werfhorst, Herman/0000-0003-2323-3782",,,,,43,25,26,6,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Since most individuals take this exam repeatedly, differences after a failure also can be observed.

Research on production risk is therefore of great importance, especially for small-scale farming systems in developing countries, where farmers are more vulnerable to risk. This study investigates the production risk of pangas farming in selected areas of Bangladesh. A Just-Pope stochastic production function is chosen to estimate the mean and risk functions. The test result shows that significant production risk exists in pangas farming, and that the risk differs between small and large farms.","[Khan, Akhtaruzzaman] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Agr Finance, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; [Guttormsen, Atle] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, N-1400 As, Norway; [Roll, Kristin Helen] Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Sch Business, Borre, Norway",Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University College of Southeast Norway,"Guttormsen, A (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, N-1400 As, Norway.",Atle.guttormsen@nmbu.no,"Khan, Akhtaruzzaman/AAS-9424-2020; Guttormsen, Atle/GZG-2356-2022","Khan, Md.

The model is validated through an online survey. The results reveal that the perceived usefulness, reciprocity, reputation and review cost significantly impact consumer online reviews intention both in China and the USA, while economic rewards and perceived ease of use show little impact on consumer reviews intention significantly.

The main driver for European gas policy is the diversification of its suppliers while Turkey is on the way to become natural gas hub between Europe and Middle East.

Circularity means reuse, remanufacturing or recycling. The circular economy records higher economic benefits, but with minimal consumption of resources and less harmful to the environment. The economy is growing very fast, resources are limited, and the consequences are seen in the degradation of nature. So, the circular economy is the only solution to this issue facing society today. As the revenues are as bigger as possible, the intermediate consumption needs to be as small as possible. If revenues are expressed by gross domestic product, within the circular economy the link between GDP and renewable resources must be direct, as the share of renewable energy grows, the GDP grows, too. Between GDP and unemployment rate there is an inverse correlation, and gas emissions are inversely proportional to renewable resources, when GDP grows, renewable energy grows, too, and unemployment rate and gas emissions are decreasing. For this, are analysed these variables for energy sector, using GDP per capita, the share of renewable energy, gas emissions and unemployment rate in relation to the active population. Starting from the theoretical concepts, an empirical model was created with these variables, showing the related link for Europe, over the 2007-2015 period, using panel analysis.","[Mihai, Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Manea, Daniela; Titan, Emilia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Vasile, Valentina] Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Mihai, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela.mihai@csie.ase.ro; daniela.manea@csie.ase.ro; emilia.titan@csie.ase.ro; valentinavasile2009@gmail.com,"Titan, Emilia/AAR-7437-2020; Mihai, Mihaela/E-6540-2018; Vasile, Valentina/M-7795-2013; MANEA, DANIELA/AAR-5590-2020","Titan, Emilia/0000-0003-0614-1958; Mihai, Mihaela/0000-0003-0326-5402; Vasile, Valentina/0000-0002-2368-1377; MANEA, DANIELA/0000-0002-7655-1541",,,,,29,15,15,5,36,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Apart from the myriad of technical problems making animal-free food products, critics have pointed out the blurry ontological status of the food and the ethical challenges therein, and have questioned the veracity of the various promissory narratives being produced. This paper considers animal-free food from a social studies of economies and markets (SSEM) perspective. As a market that currently mostly only exists in potential, an SSEM perspective can reveal the various social and material relations that comprise the (bio)capital formation that will underpin any market-to-be, an aspect of markets that are often invisible once markets are up and running. Moreover, this perspective details the intimate role markets have in establishing the ethical and ontological aspects of animal-free foods in a political economy shaped by neoliberalisation and financialisation.","[Mouat, Michael J.; Prince, Russell] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Prince, R (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",r.j.prince@massey.ac.nz,"Mouat, Michael/T-7499-2019","Mouat, Michael/0009-0008-6463-6952",,,,,80,54,59,4,77,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

However, ICT is believed to be a two-edged sword which offers tremendous benefits to the organization and also responsible for inducing stress amongst employees. This type of stress is referred to as technostress. Technology has created a knowledge gap for employees because of task reengineering, increased workload, multi-tasking, work-family conflict. Researches have demonstrated that technostress can affect an employee's performances, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. However, the relationship between technostress job design and employee engagement has not been examined. Using the job characteristic model and social exchange theory this present study has examined the relationship between technostress, job design, and employee engagement. Data was collected from 319 individuals working in the Nigerian commercial banks and data was analyzed using smart PLS. The result indicated that job design has a significant influence on technostress, and technostress has a significant influence on employee engagement. Contrary to our proposed negative relationship based on job design, employee engagement and stress literature in which negative relationship is expected between job design and stress, stress and engagement, the result of this study revealed a positive relationship between job design and technostress is an indication that job design alone may not be able to moderate the effect of technostress if technological elements of job design is not addressed. While technostress does not necessarily reduce employee engagement but a moderate level of stress can serve as a motivator while extreme stress can demotivate employee. Additionally, the result of the study shows a positive relationship between job design and employee engagement and technostress mediates the relationship between job design and employee engagement.","[Okolo, Deborah; Kamarudin, Suzilawati] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Level 10,Menara Razak Jalan Sultan Yahaya Petra, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia; [Ahmad, Ungku Norulkamar Ungku] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Business Adm, Johor Baharu, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Okolo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Level 10,Menara Razak Jalan Sultan Yahaya Petra, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",debbieokolo@yahoo.com; suzilawati@ibs.utm.my; m-nkamar@utm.my,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,10,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,442,456,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200039,0

This goal was achieved by examining the relationships between debtor-friendliness of the bankruptcy law model and its efficiency on one side and entrepreneurship and innovation on the other. The cross-sectional ANOVA test and OLS regression method were chosen as the research method. In order to verify the research hypothesis, the following variables were standardized: ease of second chance, severity of bankruptcy procedures index and resolving insolvency index. In the next step, on the basis of their standardized values, factorization in pairs (debtor-friendliness of bankruptcy law versus its efficiency and debtor-friendliness of bankruptcy law versus risk tolerance) was performed according to the mean. Such standardization and classification made it possible to analyse the variance of the risk acceptance variable in relation to the factor of the (low and high) classes of the above-mentioned bound variables. Finally, two studies were conducted using the classic analysis of variance. The analysis of the research results showed that the debtor-friendliness of the bankruptcy law measured by the ease of second chance index fails to increase the entrepreneurs' tolerance of risk. However, the efficiency of the bankruptcy system measured with the resolving insolvency index does increase entrepreneurs' risk tolerance risk in the countries surveyed. Next, it was checked whether the entrepreneurs' higher risk tolerance is accompanied by the development of entrepreneurship and innovativeness. Based on regression models, the above relations were confirmed.","[Prusak, Blazej; Flisikowski, Karol] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland; [Morawska, Sylwia] Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll Business Adm, Warsaw, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Warsaw School of Economics,"Prusak, B (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Gdansk, Poland.",blaprusa@pg.edu.pl; smorawska@gmail.com; karflisi@pg.edu.pl,"Prusak, Błażej/G-3090-2018","Prusak, Błażej/0000-0002-6526-0407",,,,,26,1,1,0,3,UNIV WISMAR,WISMAR,"PHILIPP-MULLER-STRASSE 14, WISMAR, 23966, GERMANY",,,978-3-942100-56-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,56,63,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN0CA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000472641400007,0

In line with previous research, time poverty is defined as a lack of enough time for rest and leisure. Three time-poverty measures are adopted. By all three measures, women paid workers and low-paid workers account for a disproportionate share of the time poor. Regression analysis further shows that, other things being equal, workers who are women, low-paid, married, and who live with children or the elderly in counties with higher overtime rates and lower minimum wage standards are more likely to be time poor. Simulations indicate that enforcing working time regulations and raising minimum wage standards could be effective for reducing time poverty.","[Qi, Liangshu] Tsinghua Univ, Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",Tsinghua University; University of Winnipeg,"Qi, LS (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Econ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qilsh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573146]; International Development Research Center of Canada [107579],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Development Research Center of Canada,This work was carried out with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Center of Canada (Project no. 107579) and a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71573146).

This paper provides an overview of the main trends in the development of the mechanical engineering in Russia, including availability of state programs for modernization of the industry. To forecast the parameters of the development of the mechanical engineering market, we use the model of interspecies interaction Lotka-Volterra.

Interviews, carried out in the Czech Republic, with 40 first-time homebuyers and 10 with their parents were used to identify multiple layers of debt performativity. These layers consist of statements expressing moral evaluations and emotions; calculative and cognitive devices; and references to practices. Two arguments are advanced through a framework of layered performativity. The first argument concerns the subjectivities of debtors. Debtors adopt investment concepts in their statements and use calculative devices. However, by relying on familial moral orders of security and familial financial transfers, these debtors must be regarded rather as semi-financialised subjects. The second argument relates to the re-configuration of social and economic relations in families. Debt attachment endorses the use of intergenerational financial transfers, which in turn may enforce continued intra-familial reciprocity, both in terms of the recipients' obligation to the providers of a gift or loan as well as concerning an obligation to help their children attain homeownership in the future. Finally, intergenerational transfers also transform the character of the mortgage market and mortgage debt, making informal debts an important part of formal debt circuits.","[Samec, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Sociol, Jilska 1, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Samec, T (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Sociol, Jilska 1, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",tomas.samec@soc.cas.cz,"Hoření Samec, Tomáš/C-8940-2016","Hoření Samec, Tomáš/0000-0003-4378-0732",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic/Grantova agentura Ceske republiky [GA16-06335S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic/Grantova agentura Ceske republiky(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic/Grantova agentura Ceske republiky [grant number GA16-06335S].,,79,18,19,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The reciprocal connections between industries which are generally described as being 'high technology' and other sectors are necessary for effective innovative processes and thriving technological transfer to the whole economy. The reciprocal connections and the symbiosis between high-tech MI and automotive industry are therefore considered to be an important assumption for the Czech and Slovak long-term economic performance.

The dynamic panel model of Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000) is used to examine this issue. We propose a novel approach by combining the least square dummy variable correction method (LSDVC) to remove the estimates bias in the dynamic panel model and the least trimmed squares (LTS) to control outlier influence. The combination of these two methods is referred to as LSDVC + LTS. Our results show a counter-intuitive evidence that bank development negatively affects economic growth when the outlier influence is ignored. This counter-intuitive evidence holds even when the conventional winsorization method is used to control the outliers. However, bank development exhibits a positive influence on economic growth once the proposed approach LSDVC + LTS is adopted.

The division and distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other stakeholders) and inclusion of the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs are identified with the help of Corporate Governance mechanism and guidelines. The need to make corporate governance in India transparent was felt after the high profile corporate governance failure scams like the stock market scam, the UTI scam, Ketan Parikh scam, Satyam scam, which were severely criticized by the shareholders. Thus, Corporate Governance is not just company administration but more than that and includes monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders thereby ensuring fair, efficient and transparent functioning of the corporate management system. By this paper, the authors intend to examine the concept of corporate governance in India with regard to the provisions of corporate governance under the Companies Act 2013. The paper will highlight the importance and need of corporate governance in India.

DBS was applied to the World GDP dataset which was constructed by selecting the purchasing power parity converted gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for the years: 1970-2010. The dynamic time warping distances were used to compute the optimal alignment between time series. The number of clusters was derived from, and the quality of the clustering and were verified by the topographic map which is a 3D representation of data structures.

Managing inventory is considered as one of the most challenging tasks facing supply chain managers and specialist due to the fact, that decisions related to inventory locations, level of inventory kept throughout the supply chain have a fundamental impact on the response time, service level, delivery lead-time and the total cost of the supply chain. The concept of Consignment Stock is crucial for helping manage inventories in which the supplier keeps the inventory and maintains a stock of material in the buyer's possession.

Moral sentiments-and especially what Adam Smith called the sense of propriety, the sense of merit and the sense of justice-play a productive role in organizing the extraction of economic value. Conversely, relative valuations in the economy (prices, for instance) can be thought of as moral engines that reward or sanction certain behaviors, and are presumed to index underlying moral differences. Economic value is produced both when individuals are morally aligned with the rational goals of capitalism, and when they perform unhinged deviations from the moral standard. I show how modern digital capitalism organizes profit extraction through these twin processes of alignment and unhingement, building new economic moralities in the process-moral sentiments that are the result of people's interactions with opaque but powerful forms of behavioral fine-tuning, surveillance and manipulation.","[Fourcade, Marion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fourcade, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",marion.fourcade@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,31,36,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In systems characterized by state uncertainty, decision makers often invest in monitoring to learn about the level of a stock. We develop a stochastic bioeconomic model of marine invasive species management under state uncertainty. The decision maker in our model simultaneously evaluates optimal investment in monitoring and population control. Using a recently-devised method for solving continuous-state Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), we find that the ability to learn through monitoring can alter the role of population control in the optimal policy function, for example by reducing control intensity in favor of monitoring. Optimal monitoring depends on the management context, including in our application lionfish population structure. The rich transient dynamics of our model depend critically on the relationship between the initial conditions for information and invader abundance. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Through a critical examination of the discourses and practices of Airbnb in the popular media, courts of law and public hearings, I argue that internet-based platforms such as Airbnb represent a fundamental reworking of social relations of property based on radically new socio-material assemblages. These assemblages-which have served to further commoditise housing by constructing a new market in short-term rentals-have entailed the disruption of not just the hospitality sector, but of the socio-spatial relations of urban housing. As emerging spaces of domestic entrepreneurialism, short-term rentals have generated their own forms of localised opposition. With the spread of Airbnb transforming the lived spaces of housing across New York City, a discursive struggle has ensued over the meanings of this new form of domestic property. In the popular press, courts of law and the chambers and steps of city halls, the stakes have been nothing less than the means and ends of urban governance itself.","[Stabrowski, Filip] CUNY, LaGuardia Community Coll, Dept Social Sci, New York, NY 11101 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Stabrowski, F (通讯作者)，CUNY, LaGuardia Community Coll, Dept Social Sci, New York, NY 11101 USA.",fstabrowski@lagcc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,68,73,77,5,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Yet little is known about the effects of class size on student outcomes in online college classes, even though online courses have become commonplace in many institutions of higher education. We study a field experiment in which college students were quasi-randomly assigned to either regular sized classes or slightly larger classes. Regular classes had, on average, 31 students and treatment classes were, on average, ten percent larger. The experiment was conducted at DeVry University, one of the nation's largest for-profit postsecondary institutions, and included over 100,000 student course enrollments in nearly 4,000 classes across 111 different undergraduate and graduate courses.

There is a need for more studies on the social basis for climate change asking why people hold the attitudes they do, rather than the dominant tendency to ask how to change attitudes and behavior. Research in different fields show that fundamental life values and worldviews are shaped through life and heavily influenced by early life socialization and culture, which in turn can shape attitudes toward specific phenomena like climate change. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian public and examined how cultural resources and trust in environmental governance institutions are related to attitudes toward climate change. High levels of trust are associated with a tendency to perceive climate change as human caused, and low levels of trust correspond with stronger beliefs that climate change are natural phenomena. High levels of cultural resources are found among climate change deniers as well as believers, indicating that groups with different political, professional and intellectual orientations, as well as life histories, may not trust climate change science. We argue that improved knowledge about the social basis for climate change is an imperative part of futures-oriented expertise.","[Kaltenborn, Bjorn P.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-2624 Storhove, Lillehammer, Norway; [Krange, Olve] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Tangeland, Torvald] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Consumpt Res Norway SIFO, Postboks 4,St Olavs Plass, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Kaltenborn, BP (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-2624 Storhove, Lillehammer, Norway.",bjom.kaltenborn@nina.no; olve.krange@nina.no; torvald.tangeland@sifo.hioa.no,,"Tangeland, Torvald/0000-0002-6742-6407",,,,,60,8,8,2,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,MAY,2017,89.0,,,,,,1,13,,10.1016/j.futures.2017.04.005,0.0,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,EX0XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402943300001,0

Our study is based on the data of 3686 physician practices in Germany for the years 2006 to 2008. We apply a translog functional form and include a comprehensive set of variables that have not been previously used in this context. A system of four equations using three-stage least squares is estimated. We find that a higher degree of specialization leads to a decrease in costs, whereas quality certification increases costs. Costs of group practices are higher than of solo practices. The latter finding can be explained by the existence of indivisibilities of expensive technical equipment. Smaller practices do not reach the critical mass to invest in certain technologies, which leads to differences in the type of health care services provided by different practice types. This is the first study to use physician practices as the unit of observation and to consider the endogenous character of physician input. Our results suggest that identifying factors that influence physician practice costs is important for providing evidence-based physician payment systems and to enable decision-makers to set incentives effectively.","[Kwietniewski, Lukas; Heimeshoff, Mareike; Schreyoegg, Jonas] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Schreyögg, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",jonas.schreyoegg@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Schreyögg, Jonas/AAY-6182-2021","Schreyögg, Jonas/0000-0001-8030-2161",,,,,56,3,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Spain has been one of the European countries hardest hit by the financial crisis that started in 2008. The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the double-dip recession in Spain on the most recent trends in suicide. Suicide data from the years 2002-2012 were obtained from the 'Death Statistic according to Cause of Death' of the National Statistics Institute (NSI). Population figures were obtained from the population estimates of the NSI. While the suicide rate decreased between 2002 and 2012, the downward trend has reversed twice, in 2008-2009, and in 2012. This rise was particularly pronounced in males, with the rate ratio of 1.12 (95 % CI 1.05-1.20) in 2008 and 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03-1.18) in 2009. Following a decrease in 2010 and 2011, suicides among males have increased again in 2012-with RR of 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03-1.18) compared to 2007, however the difference between 2011 amounted to 14 % rise-the biggest interannual change in a decade. There was a similar but less pronounced pattern in females. Regional data showed variable results. These results suggest that the Spanish economic crisis has been associated with suicide rates in 2008, 2009, and 2012. These findings are consistent with the double-dip recession that Spain experienced.","[Isabel, Ruiz-Perez; Miguel, Rodriguez-Barranco; Antonio, Rojas-Garcia; Oscar, Mendoza-Garcia] Escuela Andaluza Salud Publ, Granada, Spain; [Isabel, Ruiz-Perez] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ CIBERESP, Granada, Spain",Escuela Andaluza de Salud Publica; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP,"Isabel, RP (通讯作者)，Escuela Andaluza Salud Publ, Granada, Spain.;Isabel, RP (通讯作者)，CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ CIBERESP, Granada, Spain.",isabel.ruiz.easp@juntadeandalucia.es,"Garcia, Antonio Rojas/AAA-1422-2021; PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Rojas Garcia, Antonio/GPX-8129-2022","Rojas Garcia, Antonio/0000-0002-7792-4311; Ruiz-Perez, Isabel/0000-0002-9565-0502",Consejeria de Salud [PI 0360-2012],Consejeria de Salud,Consejeria de Salud: PI 0360-2012,,35,32,33,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We use the distance to the civil registry office and the mother's document of identification as instrumental variables of the child's birth certificate.

However, advocates of malpractice reform often argue that most malpractice claims are unrelated to provider performance. We study the connection between hospital adverse events and malpractice claim rates in the two states with public data sets on medical malpractice claim rates: Florida and Texas. We use Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, to measure rates for 17 types of adverse events. Hospitals with high rates for one PSI usually have high rates for other PSIs. We find a strong association between PSI rates and malpractice claim rates with extensive control variables and hospital fixed effects (in Florida) or county fixed effects (in Texas). Our results, if causal, provide evidence that malpractice claims leading to payouts are not random events. Instead, hospitals that improve patient safety can reduce malpractice payouts. We also study local variation in adverse event rates, in the spirit of the Dartmouth Atlas work on variation in treatment intensity. We find large variations, both across counties and across hospitals within counties. This suggests that many adverse hospital events are avoidable at reasonable cost, since some hospitals are avoiding them.","[Black, Bernard S.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Black, Bernard S.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Wagner, Amy R.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Zabinski, Zenon] Bates White Econ Consulting, Washington, DC USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Black, BS (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Black, BS (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",bblack@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,51,8,9,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

By 2007, traditional technologies and household-based technologies are used in almost all sample villages. However, the shares of sown area on which water saving technologies are used are still fairly low. Econometric analysis using plot level fixed effects show that using water saving technologies can reduce crop water use and improve the productivity of water. The positive effects are generated mainly through the use of household-based or community based technologies. The use of water saving technologies does not have statistically significant impacts on total irrigated sown area and crop mix. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although hundreds of biomass promotion policies have been enacted at state and national levels in the United States, the effectiveness of these various policies individually and as a policy system remains unclear. Here We draw upon a survey of biomass producers and users at various supply-chain steps to explore whether and how individual policies and the larger policy system influence innovation and decision-making. We find that individual policies were considered influential in a small but substantial proportion of significant changes made to operations, with disbursement tax, and regulatory policies seen as the most influential. A relatively small proportion of respondents were willing or able to describe policy effects across multiple supply-chain steps; those who did described variably effective biomass support policies, largely at the state level, conflicting with federal regulatory policies that were seen as creating additional costs and uncertainties. These results suggest that the biomass policy system in the United States may not be well designed to support innovation, particularly due to conflicts between biomass promotion policies and other forest, environmental, or energy policies.

While in Europe there is austerity as popularly depicted, in the United States, where mortgage-backed securities have become central to monetary policy, the agenda is to keep households meeting their debt obligations. These differences are explained in terms of different conceptions of monetary policy and evolving conceptions of money itself.

Whilst the idea of culture-led urban regeneration had gained considerable prominence in a range of policy by the early twenty-first century, many questions have remained over how exactly such 'regenerative' outcomes could be convincingly demonstrated, despite much activity to attempt such demonstration over the course of preceding years. The desire for convincing evidence can be seen in a continued, and increasing, focus on evaluation, and methods aimed at providing evidence of impact and outcomes. In light of the renewed political focus in recent years on 'proving' the effects and value of cultural activity, this paper considers the continuation of practice in this area, and asks what lessons, if any, have been learned in evaluative practice which seeks to demonstrate the regenerative effects of culture. In light of the continuation of apparently problematic practices, the paper seeks to delineate and account for what has been learned, and what has not.","[Campbell, Peter] Univ Liverpool, Dept Sociol Social Policy & Criminol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Cox, Tamsin] DHA, Policy & Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Cox, Tamsin] Univ Liverpool, Dept Sociol Social Policy & Criminol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [O'Brien, Dave] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, Hist Art, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; Edinburgh College of Art; University of Edinburgh,"Campbell, P (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Sociol Social Policy & Criminol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",peter.campbell@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Campbell, Peter/0000-0001-8754-0162; O'Brien, Dave/0000-0002-1991-756X","Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/L014505/1]; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/L014505/1, AH/M50421X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; AHRC [AH/L014505/1, AH/M50421X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council [grant number AH/L014505/1].,,87,34,37,8,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

We problematise these relations contextually, from the aspect of their functional role in international relations, in the globalised world. The initial premise is that today, the international relations are driven by the global dominance, which significantly coincides with the current needs of globalisation. The dominance, as a value on which an order is established in international relations, faces a challenge in the institutionalisation of regionalisation, which is also a side-process within the process of globalisation, only confined in space and actors. Namely, it threatens global domination. We observe the problem of Eurasian relations phenomenologically. Namely, they are considered in view of their potential impact on the regional geostrategic trends, and on the capacity of leading regional actors. The aim of this article is to analyse primarily if current Eurasian development could in the near future polarise international relations. Findings indicate a new dimension in regionalisation of Eurasia, in the sense of the development of common regional civilisation, which is so far limited to differentiation from the Eurocentric concept. At the moment, though, this novelty is still not sufficiently institutionalised to undermine global institutions. On the functional level, however, this qualitative change in regionalisation of Eurasia, has the capacity to facilitate, not only constraint to domination, but also to the wider compatibility of national regimes, instead of widespread practice to instigate and enforce their change, which would represent an advance with the capacity to lead the international out of the framework of narrow neorealist agenda.","[Djurdjevic, Dragan] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Civil Aviat, Belgrade, Serbia; [Stevanovic, Miroslav] Acad Natl Secur, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Djurdjevic, D (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Civil Aviat, Belgrade, Serbia.",ddjurdjevic@naisbitt.edu.rs; mstvnv297@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,382,389,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000039,0

Our results indicate that the idiosyncratic risk plays an unimportant role in pricing stocks and that the systematic risks still dominate asset returns in emerging stock markets. Results imply that Vietnamese investors can get increased benefit from portfolio diversification.","[Fang, Kuangnan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Fang, Kuangnan] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Peaceful Dev Cross Strait, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ji] Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies IFAS, 422 Siming South Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cuong Nguyen] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Christchurch, New Zealand",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Wu, J (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Inst Financial & Accounting Studies IFAS, 422 Siming South Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",georgewu@xmu.edu.cn,"Wu, Ji/J-4917-2019; Nguyen, Cuong Cao/E-7332-2018","Wu, Ji/0000-0001-5937-8292; Nguyen, Cuong Cao/0000-0002-7563-2374","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471152, 71201139, 71303200, 71572160]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD148, 14BJY207]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [0155zk1010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Kuangnan Fang acknowledges the financial support of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71471152, 71201139, and 71303200), and National Social Science Foundation of China (13&ZD148).

However, this rejection has resulted in a lack of analyses of the politics of finance. In this paper, I suggest that cultural economy of finance should nurture a form of analysis indigenous to cultural studies - provisional framework building - whereby politically urgent and contextually specific frameworks could be offered to provoke debate about the power relations within and political impacts of financial activity. I offer a description of provisional framework building based on key commitments of cultural studies, and several examples of the practice that have already taken place in research on financial markets.

Korea was also the focus of attention by such scholars when it underwent the currency crisis in 1997. Moreover, these analyses of the political economy of Korea and Japan have so far been concentrated on changes in their industrial policies and government-business relationships. Particularly, the studies on both countries so far have been on what kinds of industrial policies and regulations the governments have promoted when companies advanced into new markets. However, given the current restructuring drives in both countries, research efforts should now be expanded to cover the relationships established among economic participants when financial and non-financial institutions are forced out of the market through the restructuring process. Therefore, this study examines institutional changes during the process of a Big Bang, or banking and financial sector restructuring, thereby reconstructing the relationship between government and market. A big bang refers to a radical change in a banking and financial system, which accelerates market-led financial sector reform. Its objective is liberalization of the financial sector and financial market opening. In fact, Korea and Japan have been establishing new reform-related systems as a means to break out of their current economic situations. The big bang-type reform measures that have been implemented in Korea and Japan could therefore be seen as the first step in the break-up of the East Asian developmental state model. The purpose and contents of big bangs, or banking and financial restructuring, are similar among countries. However, their progresses are different. If examined closely, it can be seen that even East Asian countries show huge differences in the process of their big bangs. This is true to cases of Japan and Korea. In Japan, banking and financial restructuring has been showing weak progress, and bad loans are on a continual increase. By contrast, Korea has promoted ample restructuring, and was able to dispose of its bad loans sooner and more than expected. Why does the disparity in performance between the two nations exist? In order to answer this question, this study compares the roles and structures of the main banks of both countries, and analyzes how the differences between them affected the big bang and banking and financial restructuring of these countries. Consequently, this thesis will claim that although a big bang process is a drastic reform measure based on market principles, its effectiveness will depend upon the strong role of the government involved.","[Igbinosa, Samson; Fortune, Obawe] Link Educ Consultant, Hyderabad, Andhra Prades, India",,"Igbinosa, S (通讯作者)，Link Educ Consultant, Hyderabad, Andhra Prades, India.",brossam2001@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,113,121,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700011,0

The works on the theme of monopolistic competition Paul Krugman (1979, 1980) and Kelvin Lancaster (1979, 1980) and the theme of the oligopoly James Brander and Barbara Spencer (1981) spawned a number of new theoretical work. Consideration of imperfect competition has provided powerful tools for the interpretation of the positive theory of trade policy. Protection of trade is a deliberate attempt to limit the import or export promotion because of barriers to trade. Despite the arguments in favor of free trade and increasing trade openness, protectionism is still widely practiced around the world. Competition is democracy in the economy, because there can be no real political democracy if economic power lies in the hands of a few. It is the duty of respect for the prohibition of competition is considered from the aspect of mutual relations between persons and the company in accordance with the laws. The consequences of violation of the prohibition of competition may be different. Effective competition is pervenciju creation or strengthening of positions of power that can be too influential in society and politics. In countries in transition, where we can today to include Libya and, in practice, it can be seen that the centers of power are out of state institutions, the flow of money and economic impact. As a model of legal protection of competition in the market and Libya and the countries of North Africa to be formed by competition authorities, which would represent a special type of independent regulatory bodies, which should monitor the sectors of the economy. The role of these bodies would be, on the one hand economic regulation with tasks common with sector regulators (prevention of abuse of a dominant position or the adoption of anti-monopoly policy), on the other hand, these tasks were not limited to a specific sector (such as telecommunications or the oil sector), but to their mandate could be expanded so that they protect all the rights that are considered essential in today's societies, twenty-first century.","[Issa, Adnan] John Naisbitt Univ, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Issa, A (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",lakilee@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,663,666,,,,,,4,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000072,0

However, little has been done to evaluate it quantitatively. Employing theory of change, this study assesses and compares empirical evidence of the influence of the FSC forest management certification approach to enhance livelihood conditions in Kilwa, Tanzania, by using economic valuation methods and governance indicators. This is achieved through a comparative study of villages with certified community forests (FSC) under community based forest management and those without (non-FSC). Results show that annual average household forest income from FSC-certified forests is significantly higher than that of households in non-FSC-certified forests. With reference to rule compliance as an indicator of good governance, implementation of forest bylaws in villages managing FSC-certified forests is significantly more effective than villages in non-FSC-certified forests. These findings provide an insight into the influence of forest certification in enhancing livelihood conditions and that the incorporation of FSC standards into forest policies may lead to more enhancement of livelihood conditions. These findings serve as a baseline for further research on the effects of forest certification at both spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), while aiming to address the issue through various regulatory measures, has created many friction points with other treaty regimes - international trade, intellectual property, and investment. In particular, the tension between the FCTC and the World Trade Organization (WTO) has received much scholar attention. However, the existing literature focuses largely on reconciling public health measures and WTO rules applicable to legal trade in tobacco products. An equally important issue has been left out -illicit trade. Illegally manufactured, distributed, and sold tobacco amounts to 650 billion cigarettes annually - over 12% of the global total. Illicit tobacco trade has exacerbated the tobacco epidemic and undermined the effectiveness of price and tax measures. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (Protocol) was adopted under the FCTC to strengthen supply chain controls, establish legal liabilities, and facilitate international cooperation. However, issues such as supply chain complexity, surreptitious nature, and industry involvement have been overlooked in the negotiation stage. This article therefore examines such factors in depth and identifies two missing governance tools - a notification system and a whistleblower mechanism - to close the loophole, facilitate implementation, and strengthen the global regulatory strategy.","[Lin, Ching-Fu] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Lin, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",chingfulin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,"Lin, Ching-Fu/IWD-5352-2023","Lin, Ching-Fu/0000-0003-4348-1820",,,,,67,1,1,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Recently, policymakers in several countries have set out to try and achieve reindustrialization. The servicification of firms is related to these concerns and aspirations. However, servicification, and particularly its role in trade policy, has received limited attention. I review micro-level evidence and discuss its implications. I find that imported, domestic and exported services are all important to contemporary firm competitiveness and participation in international value chains. Therefore, historic policymaking divisions between trade in manufactures and trade in services services, between export and import interests, and among modes of supply are becoming less relevant. I conclude by suggesting potential steps forward.","[Lodefalk, Magnus] Univ Orebro, Dept Econ, Orebro, Sweden",Orebro University,"Lodefalk, M (通讯作者)，Univ Orebro, Dept Econ, Orebro, Sweden.",magnus.lodefalk@oru.se,"Lodefalk, Magnus/AAI-1579-2021","Lodefalk, Magnus/0000-0003-0149-9598",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation,"This paper is based partially on my blog column Lodefalk (2015).

The study is based on the data retrieved from the World Bank Database. During the considered 15 years, eleven LDCs recorded negative average annual GDP per capita growth rates and four countries had growth rates smaller than 0.5%. In the analysed LDCs, GDP has been mainly generated through services and agriculture sectors. The poorest countries were highly dependent on agriculture which provided a living for the vast majority of their population. On the demand side, domestic private consumption was the main source of growth in the examined LDCs. In the years 2001-2015, a half of the analysed countries experienced a decline in the share of exports of goods and services in GDP. Ten LDCs were classified as aid-dependent. Besides, remittances were a significant source of finance in five of them. The countries, except one, did not attract foreign direct investment. LDCs with very low or negative growth rates have serious problems with corruption and poor governance. Moreover, they are affected by conflicts, internal political turmoil and suffered from shocks (natural environmental disasters).

The case study methodology was employed to answer two research questions: what factors influence development of charity shops, and what initiatives and projects have been supported by donations and charity. The data allows concluding that a lack of corresponding normative regulations hinders development of new social enterprises. There is a need for wider communication and explanatory work with businesses, municipalities, policy makers, and wider society.

The research aim is to assess the development of water management infrastructure in Latvia in the programming period 2007-2013 and give recommendations for the next programming period's activities. The specific research tasks to achieve the aim are as follows: 1) to analyse the amounts of funding from the EU Funds for Latvia and support instruments for the development of water management infrastructure in the programming period 2007-2013; 2) to assess the contribution of the EU Funds to the water management infrastructure in Zemgale region in order to identify opportunities for its enhancement in the period 2014-2020. The research found that funding from the EU Funds, including that for the development of water management infrastructure, was spent unequally across the regions, as a considerably greater proportion of the funding was invested in Riga region, compared with the other regions. Funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF), depending on the size of a populated area, is available for the development of water management infrastructure.

The authors determine the level and evaluate dynamics of development of situation in the sphere of ecological and food security of Russia, conduct analysis of current state and problems of development of the sphere of manufacture of ECO-products in Russia and cluster processes in this sphere, and develop cluster model of import-substitution in the sphere of manufacture of ECO-products as a perspective direction of provision of ecological and food security of Russia. As a result, the authors come to the conclusion that modern Russia is characterized by low level of ecological and food security. Its increase requires the usage of cluster instrumentarium.

An adjusted (incomplete) CDM model was used to estimate effects of characteristics of firms (firm size, government funding, market orientation, or foreign ownership) on the innovation process (decision to innovate, R&D intensity, sales from innovated goods). Public support had a very limited or even negative effect on innovation inputs and outputs. This analysis suggests that there is no relationship between R&D expenditures and sales of innovated goods. The coefficients are quite similar for new-to-the-market innovators and new-to-the-enterprise innovators. The orientation of the world market is a highly important factor of new-to-the-market innovators. The ability to capture sales of innovated goods is higher for smaller firms, but only for the new-to-the-firm innovators. The analysis also showed differences between innovators in service sector and manufacturing sector. Cooperation is a positive factor of innovation intensity in the manufacturing sector; however on average, there is zero effect of cooperation in the service sector.

Adopting a retrospective analysis of classical theoretical literature and recent empirical experiences of natural resource institutions, this paper discusses institutional analysis as pertains to the natural resource governance context. Synthesizing from relevant literature, this review designs and discusses an analytical framework to illustrate how formal and informal institutions structure natural resource governance. The key elements in the framework are: biophysical element, process and institutional element, behavioral choice element, enforcement mechanisms and an outcome element. The paper argues that for formal rule to be more effective, it greatly depends on its relationship with the informal institutions and more importantly their enforcement complementarities. The study, consequently, discusses key elements that influence the effectiveness of natural resource rule enforcement. This review concludes that both formal and informal institutions serve as catalysts to reinforce natural resource governance; however, the two could also combine to form a clandestine network to facilitate unethical resource exploitation. The paper puts forward that, it is not institutions per se but the nature of interaction between formal and informal institutions together with the enforcement mechanisms which will to a large extent determine the kind of resource outcomes.

Pesticide use is essentially universal in conventional agricultural production globally. The Codex establishes MRLs for various pesticides. In the 1990s there was de facto harmonization of MRLs based on Codex or, absent an international standard, importer acceptance of the exporter's MRL. Since that time many countries have been establishing nationally based MRLs, leading to asynchronous regulations that act as trade barriers. This trend is particularly disturbing given the important role international trade in agri-food products is expected to play in meeting the food security challenges associated with feeding a global population predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050. This article explores the reasons for the increasing divergence in MRLs and its trade impacts, outlines the food security concerns arising from this increasing non-tariff barrier and examines multilateral, regional and national efforts to foster MRL harmonization and counter the trend to nationally based MRLs.","[Yeung, May T.] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Kerr, William A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Coomber, Blair] Agri Food Sect, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lantz, Matthew] Bryant Christie Inc, Global Access, Seattle, WA USA; [Mcconnell, Alyse] Bryant Christie Inc, Int Regulatory Affairs, Seattle, WA USA",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Yeung, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",may.yeung@usask.ca; kerr.w@esteycentre.com; blaircoomber@icloud.com; Matthew.Lantz@bryantchristie.com; Alyse.McConnell@bryantchristie.com,"Yeung, May/ABB-9483-2021","Yeung, May/0000-0003-1359-5974",Canola Council of Canada,Canola Council of Canada,Funding from the Canola Council of Canada to support this research is gratefully acknowledged.,,42,3,3,0,10,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We focus on what types of interaction prevail in the process of creating new knowledge and diffusing existing ones and what role different types of organizations have during this process. This paper offers new insights into the role that innovation in multinational firms has on knowledge creation and diffusion in developing countries as they interact with and reinforce weak sectoral innovation systems. Our findings indicate that multinational companies follow three main strategies to cope with the limitations of the local innovation system: cooperate among them, establish links with international research centres and, have a network of suppliers of technology. The spillovers to local agents are greater in case of networks established with the purpose of generate new knowledge.","[Aboal, Diego; Rovira, Flavia; Veneri, Federico] Ctr Invest Econ CINVE, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Aboal, Diego] Univ ORT, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Aboal, Diego] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay","University ORT Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Aboal, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest Econ CINVE, Montevideo, Uruguay.",aboal@cinve.org.uy,,"Aboal, Diego/0000-0002-6217-962X","International Center of Research for Development (IDRC, Canada); Perez-Guerrero Trust Fund for South-South Cooperation, Group of 77, United Nations; Red Sur","International Center of Research for Development (IDRC, Canada); Perez-Guerrero Trust Fund for South-South Cooperation, Group of 77, United Nations; Red Sur","This work was possible thanks to the support of Red Sur; the International Center of Research for Development (IDRC, Canada); Perez-Guerrero Trust Fund for South-South Cooperation, Group of 77, United Nations.",,59,5,6,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2018,97.0,,,,,,9,20,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.013,0.0,,,12,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,HE0KP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452955800002,0

Although involuntary absenteeism due to accident or illness that prevents workers from performing their work is unavoidable, avoidable voluntary absenteeism may also emerge due to asymmetric information given that neither employers nor doctors have perfect information about workers' health status. Assuming that there is heterogeneity in individual's behaviour and thus some workers are more likely to take sick leave than others due to differences in observable and unobservable characteristics, we specify a Finite Mixture Model to analyse sick leave days per year using a sample of employees from the 2014 European Health Survey in Spain. This specification accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in a discrete way assuming that there are two types of workers even though the data do not allow us to identify which group any individual belongs to. Our results reveal that, although health indicators have the greatest impact on the proportional change in days of absenteeism, there is heterogeneity in sick leave decisions and individual and job characteristics have different effect on the absenteeism of each group.","[Jose Suarez, Maria; Muniz, Cristina] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Ave del Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Suárez, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Ave del Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",msuarezf@uniovi.es,"Artime, Cristina Muniz/K-9622-2017; Suárez, María José/HKM-9128-2023","Artime, Cristina Muniz/0000-0001-9935-8149; Suárez, María José/0000-0002-8152-1435","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2017-86402-C2-1-R]","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness via grant ECO2017-86402-C2-1-R.",,44,2,3,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Using multi-dimensional poverty index and deprivation score derived from a panel dataset of household surveys and appropriate econometric models, this paper evaluates the program impact on both participating decision and its intended targets. Our results show that the risks encountered by households have a push effect on the resettlement decision, while the opportunities households obtained have a pull effect. Also, farmers who are risk takers are more likely to take part, and the government supports for relocation and skill training have significant effect on the decision. Further, the program has significantly reduced the number of dimensions of households in poverty and the living condition of resettled households and the local environment have been much improved. However, reduction in the deprivation score is not so obvious yet, and the increase of household net income remains small. Important policy implications to and recommendations for this program and other similar policies in and outside of China can be drawn from this study.","[Wang, Wenlue; Yu, Jin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenlue] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Finance & Econ, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ren, Qian] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Gansu Agricultural University; Shaanxi University of Science & Technology,"Yu, J (通讯作者)，Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",wangwl@gsau.edu.cn; mayrqxh@hotmail.com; yujin@nwafu.edu.cn,,"Yu, Jin/0000-0002-0913-0798","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71377208, 71573208]; [2015KW-053]; [A213021501]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ;,"This paper reports the results obtained from the following joint projects: Research on the Peasant Household Responding and Economic Effects of the Ecological Migration Policy from the Anti-poverty Perspective (71377208) and Experimental Measurement on Farmers' Risk Preferences and Interconnection between Public Policies and Farmers (71573208) sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and two other projects (2015KW-053 and A213021501).

Recent research suggests that the nursing supply adjusts to macroeconomic conditions. However, prior work has failed to consider the effect of macroeconomic conditions on demand for nurses through the effect on revenues. We test how county-level unemployment rates affect direct-care staffing rates in nursing homes using California data. We exploit the wide variation in the unemployment rates across counties and over time in 2005-12. We also test whether there are heterogeneous effects of unemployment rates by facility size, staffing level, and profit status. We find that as unemployment rates increase, staffing by registered nurses (RNs) decreases but staffing by licensed practical nurses (LPNs) increases. The increase in LPNs is larger in large nursing homes, nursing homes with higher staffing levels, and in for-profit nursing homes. We also find that as unemployment rates increase, nursing home revenue decreases. While the effect of macroeconomic conditions on nursing supply may be important for cost and quality of care, the mechanism is not simple, direct, or homogeneous for all types of nurses and nursing homes.","[Konetzka, R.

A nested Markov model was employed using the perspective of the British National Health Service (NHS). Effectiveness outcomes were the 10-year CVD risk of individuals with mild (4-6 mmol/l) and high (above 6 mmol/l) cholesterol by gender and age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-85 years); CVD events avoided and QALY gains over 20 years. This study found that daily consumption of enriched spread reduces CVD risks more for men and older age groups. Assuming 50% compliance, 69 CVD events per 10,000 men and 40 CVD events per 10,000 women would be saved over 20 years. If the NHS pays the excess cost of enriched spreads, for the high-cholesterol group, the probability of enriched spreads being cost-effective is 100% for men aged over 64 years and women over 74, at 20,000 pound/QALY threshold. Probabilities of cost-effectiveness are lower at younger ages, with mildly elevated cholesterol and over a 10-year time horizon. If consumers bear the full cost of enriched spreads, NHS savings arise from reduced CVD events.","[Yang, Wei] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Gage, Heather; Jackson, Daniel] Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Raats, Monique] Univ Surrey, Food Consumer Behav & Hlth Res Ctr, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Sch Psychol, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Surrey; University of Surrey,"Yang, W (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London WC2R 2LS, England.",wei.yang@kcl.ac.uk; h.gage@surrey.ac.uk; d.jackson@surry.ac.uk; m.raats@surrey.ac.uk,"Raats, Monique/G-5348-2012","Raats, Monique/0000-0002-8057-2783; Gage, Heather/0000-0002-2049-9406",,,,,49,11,11,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Methods: Across-sectional study was conducted. A total of 652 households consented to participate in the study (326 insured and 326 uninsured households). Propensity score matching was used to explain possible differences in the baseline variables between enrolled and un-enrolled households. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors for healthcare utilization. Results: Healthcare utilization among insured households was 50.5% (95% CI: 44.8%, 56.2%). Whilst among uninsured households, healthcare utilization was 29.3% (95% CI: 24.11, 34.47). In general, the overall healthcare utilization was 39.89% (95% CI: 35.7, 43.8). The overall increase in patient-attendance given illness among insured households was 25.2% higher compared with uninsured (t = 4.94, 95% CI: 0.145, 0.359). Educated (primary and above) (AOR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.98), chronic patient (AOR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.13, 3.06), first choice was health facilities at the point of illness (AOR = 6.33; 95% CI: 2.97-13.51), rich (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.43), and insured (AOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.23) were independently associated with increased healthcare utilization. Conclusion: Enrolment to mutual health insurance increases healthcare utilization. Presence of illness in the households, household earnings, educational status, first choice of treatment at point of illness, and membership to Mutual Health Insurance scheme should be targeted during escalating of healthcare utilization.","[Atnafu, Desta Debalkie; Alemu, Yihun Mulugeta] Bahir Dar Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia; [Tilahun, Hiwot] Amhara Reg Hlth Bur, Curat & Rehabilitat Core Proc, Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia; [Asrade, Geta; Minyihun, Amare] Univ Gondar, Inst Publ Hlth, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Gondar City, Ethiopia",Bahir Dar University; University of Gondar,"Atnafu, DD (通讯作者)，Bahir Dar Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia.",destad2a@gmail.com,"Debalkie, Desta/AAA-1448-2022","Atnafu, Desta Debalkie/0000-0002-9660-4225; Minyihun, Amare/0000-0002-7996-6451",Gondar University,Gondar University,"Gondar University funded this article.

These include analyses of the prison-industrial complex as a close connection between incarceration and industry, as well as the role of neoliberal ideology and agenda in transforming the state based on discipline and control as responses to social ills. Following Castoriadis' decolonisation of the imaginary, these fundamental critiques are connected with alternatives to incarceration. Finally, exemplary alternatives to the neoliberal state complete the mosaic of social injustice and provide a broader picture on this important debate.","[Zoellick, Jan C.] Humboldt Univ, Freie Univ Berlin, Charite Univ Med Berlin, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Zoellick, Jan C.] Berlin Inst Hlth, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Zoellick, Jan C.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Sociol, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Zoellick, JC (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Freie Univ Berlin, Charite Univ Med Berlin, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Zoellick, JC (通讯作者)，Berlin Inst Hlth, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Zoellick, JC (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Sociol, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",jan.zoellick@posteo.de,"Zoellick, Jan/JCD-5604-2023","Zollick, Jan/0000-0003-1053-8819",,,,,85,0,0,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,AUG,2018,101.0,,,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.04.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GO1CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439683600001,0

The effect is very similar across individuals with different political views, but households in rural areas display a substantially greater effect than those in urban areas.

Not only have competition and competitive schemes dramatically developed in the last decades, from competition for students to competition for budgets and competition for professors, but the nature of competition has also evolved, leading to new forms of competition, especially on the segment where this evolution has been the strongest, i.e. research universities. It is argued that competition in higher education is no longer only occurring between individuals and countries, but has become institutional, leading to a multi-level form of competition and transforming universities into competitors. This competition is framed as a competition for quality which has become more organized and equipped, and that increasingly relies on impersonal judgment devices. It is shown that this growing form of competition has spawned new classifications and categories, and that alliances of competitors belonging to the same category (like leagues, guilds or associations) are simultaneously emerging. Consideration will be thus given to how competition and cooperation intersect and combine.","[Musselin, Christine] Sci Po, CNRS, CSO, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Musselin, C (通讯作者)，Sci Po, CNRS, CSO, Paris, France.",c.musselin@cso.cnrs.fr,,"Musselin, Christine/0000-0002-6720-0707",,,,,95,119,136,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This paper addresses the need to identify the evidence on the economic impact of patient navigation in colorectal cancer, following the Health Economic Evaluation Publication Guidelines. Articles indexed in Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science between January 2000 and March 2017 were analyzed. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality assessment of the included studies was based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Inclusion criteria indicated that the paper's subject had to explicitly address patient navigation in colorectal cancer and the study had to be an economic evaluation. The search yielded 243 papers, (of which were finally included within this review. Seven out of the nine studies included met standards for high-quality based on CHEERS criteria. Eight concluded that patient navigation programs were unequivocally cost-effective for the health outcomes of interest. Six studies were cost-effectiveness analyses. All studies computed the direct costs of the program, which were defined a minima as the program costs. Eight of the reviewed studies adopted the healthcare system perspective. Direct medical costs were usually divided into outpatient and inpatient visits, tests, and diagnostics. Effectiveness outcomes were mainly assessed through screening adherence, quality of life and time to diagnostic resolution. Given these outcomes, more economic research is needed for patient navigation during cancer treatment and survivorship as well as for patient navigation for other cancer types so that decision makers better understand costs and benefits for heterogeneous patient navigation programs.","[Gerves-Pinquie, Chloe] Res Inst Environm & Occupat Hlth Irset, Inserm UMR1085, Ester Team, UFR Sante,Dept Med, Rue Haute Reculee, F-49045 Angers 01, France; [Girault, Anne] French Sch Publ Hlth, EA MOS 7348, 20 Ave George Sand, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Phillips, Serena; Pratt-Chapman, Mandi] George Washington Univ, Ctr Canc, Inst Patient Ctr Initiat & Hlth Equ, 2600 Virginia Ave NW,Suite 300, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Raskin, Sarah] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, L Douglas Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Scherer Hall,313923 W Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); George Washington University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Gervès-Pinquié, C (通讯作者)，Res Inst Environm & Occupat Hlth Irset, Inserm UMR1085, Ester Team, UFR Sante,Dept Med, Rue Haute Reculee, F-49045 Angers 01, France.",chloegerves@gmail.com,"Raskin, Sarah/AAC-2435-2022; Pratt-Chapman, Mandi/AAF-1815-2020","Raskin, Sarah/0000-0002-1652-6678; Pratt-Chapman, Mandi/0000-0002-9303-7659; Girault, Anne/0000-0002-5951-3279; Gerves-Pinquie, Chloe/0000-0002-2719-9801",,,,,36,22,24,1,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

J,"Slaughter, RA",,,,"Slaughter, Richard A.",,,The IT revolution reassessed part three: Framing solutions,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,IT revolution; Algorithms; Dystopia; Values; Worldviews,,"The first section picks up the central theme of the series by focusing on ill-considered or compulsive innovation. It questions fatalistic attitudes and argues that, far from being inevitable, concerns such as artificial intelligence (AI) or Chinese surveillance practices need to be brought more fully into the open and subjected to more sustained critical enquiry. The rest of the paper takes up the theme of recovery and renewal. Some critical 'blind spots' are briefly outlined (a distinct lack of interest in global challenges; a pervasive tendency to under-value 'the social') and reframed in more positive terms. The notion of 'constitutive human interests' is raised. It's here that the implications of the project become ever more obvious since many of the concerns raised can be viewed as positive opportunities for productive innovation and adaptive change. A variety of innovations for better managing IT-related innovations and re-purposing the Internet are subsequently discussed. They include working with three scales of innovation, taming algorithms and supporting human agency. The positive innovation theme continues in the following section where wider questions about social democracy, new infrastructure and regulation are discussed. The question of 're-humanising' the IT revolution then brings in notions of the public good, moral universals and the ambiguity of rapid and unconstrained technical innovation. The overall conclusions of the paper, and indeed, of the whole project, are framed by a growing imperative to 'disrupt the disruptors' by investing in socially democratic actions and processes across the board. Finally, a new look at values and moral development arguably has significant implications for the issues discussed throughout.","[Slaughter, Richard A.] Foresight Int, POB 793, Indooroopilly, Qld, Australia",,"Slaughter, RA (通讯作者)，Foresight Int, POB 793, Indooroopilly, Qld, Australia.",rslaughter@ozemail.com.au,,,,,,,72,7,7,2,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,JUN,2018,100.0,,,,,,1,19,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.02.005,0.0,,,19,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GI7ZV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434742500001,0

This paper explores the implications of such exemptions in the case of an emission tax, and in the presence of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) costs. We develop an analytical framework capturing the trade-off between the cost-effectiveness of a broader tax base, and the savings on MRV costs enabled by a partial coverage. Second-best partial coverage is defined by a threshold value of some characteristic of the firms below which firms are exempted. We characterize the optimal threshold and discuss its welfare implications. Since determining this threshold is demanding in terms of information regarding firm-level MRV and abatement costs, we show how limited knowledge about these costs at the aggregate level can be used in practice to approximate the optimal threshold. We apply this framework to assess the welfare implications of such an instrument in the case of greenhouse gas emissions from European agriculture. The findings indicate that exempting the small emitters may provide significant savings on MRV costs compared to the full coverage, while still incentivizing cost-effective reductions in emissions.

National health claims data on prescription medicines from January 2011 to December 2015 were analyzed. Monthly medicine expenditure, medicine consumption, changes in medicine use, and market competition (Herfindahl-Hirschman index) were determined to assess the TRP impact on market dynamics. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the TRP cost-saving potential. Medicine expenditure in all three therapeutic classes was decreasing prior to TRP; however, with the TRP introduction, the cost for ACEIs and LLAs fell 25 and 45%, respectively. The costs for PPIs decreased by 10%, but the cost reductions before TRP were greater. After TRP introduction, the downward trend for monthly medicine expenditure was less steep; coefficient changes from -20,798 to -363 for PPIs (p < 0.001), from -18,175 to -4862 for ACEIs (p = 0.001) and from -10,669 to -2761 for LLAs (p = 0.105) were observed. Consumption of any therapeutic class or their market competition were not changed significantly. An increased use of the reference pantoprazole (PPIs) was observed and the market position of ezetimibe was deteriorated significantly after TRP introduction. However, the demand for the references simvastatin (LLAs) and ramipril (ACEIs) did not increase. The Slovenian TRP system was established as an effective cost-containment measure. However, pitfalls arising from a country-specific TRP should be considered when introducing this policy.","[Mardetko, Nika; Kos, Mitja] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Pharm, Chair Social Pharm, Askerceva Cesta 7, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Pharm, Chair Social Pharm, Askerceva Cesta 7, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mitja.kos@ffa.uni-lj.si,"Kos, Mitja/C-7440-2019; Kos, Mitja/KCK-0806-2024",,,,,,36,6,7,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The WTO Appellate Body's Ruling on Market Distortions and Production Costs in EU-Biodiesel (Argentina),WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,JAPAN,"This paper presents a legal-economic analysis of the Appellate Body's decision in EU-Biodiesel (Argentina) that the WTO's Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) does not permit countries to take into account government-created price distortions of major inputs when calculating anti-dumping duties. In this case, the EU made adjustments to the price of biodiesel's principal input - soybeans - in determining the cost of production of biodiesel in Argentina. The adjustment was made based on the uncontested finding that the price of soybeans in Argentina was distorted by the existence of an export tax scheme that resulted in artificially low soybean prices. The Appellate Body found that the EU was not permitted to take tax policy-induced price distortions into account in calculating dumping margins. We analyze the economic rationale for Argentina's export tax system, distortions in biodiesel markets in Argentina and the EU, and the remaining trade policy options for addressing distorted international prices. We also assess whether existing subsidies disciplines would be more effective in addressing this problem and conclude that they would not.","[Crowley, Meredith A.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England; [Crowley, Meredith A.] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Hillman, Jennifer A.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC USA",University of Cambridge; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Georgetown University,"Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.;Crowley, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",meredith.crowley@econ.cam.ac.uk; jennifer.hillman@law.georgetown.edu,,"Crowley, Meredith A./0000-0003-2864-4580",,,,,11,11,11,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,195,213,,10.1017/S1474745617000581,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430704500002,0

The decision making process was conceived as an Analytic Network Process (ANP) and all important aspects worth being taken into consideration were embodied in four conceptual subnets that gather benefits, opportunities costs and risks defined from three different perspectives: social, economic and ecological. The method was tested on an important decision which is made each ten years when the forest management plans shall be updated. The input data were collected from two small associations of landowners whose forests are managed by Solca forest district (FD), county of Suceava, Romania. The total forest area supposed to be included in the new management unit is about 360 ha and the natural type of forest is beech, mixed with silver fir. Two alternatives were taken into account: the business as usual scenario (the same rotation for all stands and the same silvicultural system, irrespective to the ownership type) and a new management unit, explicitly designed for NIPF, where coppice with standards will produce fuelwood and small size round wood for rural construction. An extensive survey was carried out in order to find out the most important criteria worth being taken into account when such a decision shall be made, as well as the landowners' expectations, concerns and uncertainties with respect to the two options: business as usual scenario and a new FMU respectively. A second survey was distributed among the villagers of a neighboring commune in order to appraise the local demand for fuelwood. Based on the information collected at the first hand four subnets referring to benefits, costs, opportunities and risks have been produced and, within each subnet, three different clusters were defined in order to appraise the relative importance of economic, social, and ecologic aspects. Making pairwise comparisons between alternatives against criteria, dusters, and subnets, we have concluded that a new management unit for NIPFs is feasible and desirable. Even though ANP seems to be a very flexible tool for making complex decisions, any potential user shall be aware of some risks pertaining to ANP methodology, especially the tendency to make too complex networks, compelling to pairwise comparisons that make less sense. On the other hand, the case study presented in this article has demonstrated that pairwise comparisons may refer not only to the relative importance of whatever two criteria or alternatives, but also to the likelihood or desirability of some certain processes that might occur in case of pursuing one of the two alternatives taken into consideration. The procedure we have proposed for making or not making a new FMU can be developed or adapted to other situations where a consistent dialogue between the decision makers and the stakeholders is a more than necessary.

Using threshold crossing as an instrument for admission in a regression discontinuity design, I find that being admitted to the first-choice programme increases the probability of completing a master's degree in that subject by about 20 percentage points. There is no clear evidence that being admitted to one of the higher degree programmes listed on the application has an effect on years of education or the probability of completing a master's degree (although point estimates indicate small positive effects).

In Slovakia best practice knowledge on shaping and implementing participatory processes is scarce. The main aim of the article is to assess the role of various stakeholders in the processes of participatory and network governance in urban forests in Slovakia. Based on selected case studies critical factors of success or failure in urban forestry at local level were identified. The methodological approach consisted of combination of multiple research methods. The main data sources for the qualitative part were expert structural interviews and complemented by desk study of relevant scientific literature, strategic documents, and personal observation and own findings from previous research projects on public participation. At national and regional levels open, continuous and initiatively functioning network is present and influences decision making. The result of the cooperation among various stakeholders at the local level most frequently takes the form of positive experience sharing from the implementation of community and civic projects, but it can also be beneficial to promote alternative proposals in strategic documents and development plans. In Slovakia, companies of municipal forests organize participatory processes in collaboration with local self-government, local and regional state government, nature conservation agencies, community activists and NGOs and enhance participation at regional and local level. The results thus show that difference between success and failure in many participatory processes is often unclear especially if a large number of stakeholders take part in the activities and their interests might differ. The crucial factor for the success or failure of the complex participatory process is to ensure the sustainability of the achieved goal or result. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

People with PSO/PsA were identified by ICD-10 codes in the SkAne Healthcare Register 1998-2007. Resource use and costs for years 2008-2011 were retrieved from the SkAne Healthcare Register and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, and socioeconomic data were retrieved from Statistics Sweden. After controlling for PSO/PsA and common additional morbidities, income, and to some extent education, had significant effects on the probability of five types of healthcare use. Overall, income showed a bell-shaped relationship to healthcare costs, with patients in income quintiles 2 and 3 having the highest mean annualized cost irrespective of model specification. Education did not have a significant effect in most specifications. Analyses including interaction effects indicated similarly higher costs across income quintiles in the PSO and PsA subgroups, though these cost differences were lower in magnitude for patients with PSO in quintile 5 and with PsA in quintile 1. In conclusion, our results show persistent socioeconomic disparities in healthcare use among a cohort of chronically ill patients and referents, even after controlling for the presence of PSO/PsA and common additional morbidities. These disparities persist even in a country with general healthcare coverage and low out-of-pocket payments.","[Lofvendahl, Sofia; Petersson, Ingemar F.] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Fac Med, Orthoped, Lund, Sweden; [Lofvendahl, Sofia; Petersson, Ingemar F.; Carlsson, Katarina Steen] Skane Univ Hosp, Hlth Technol Assessment Skane, Lund, Sweden; [Joud, Anna] Skane Univ Hosp, Epidemiol & Register Ctr South, Lund, Sweden; [Theander, Elke] Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Malmo, Sweden; [Svensson, Ake] Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Malmo, Sweden; [Carlsson, Katarina Steen] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Skane Univ Hosp, Malmo, Sweden; [Joud, Anna] Lund Univ, Div Occupat & Environm Med, Lund, Sweden; [Lofvendahl, Sofia] Skane Univ Hosp, Hlth Technol Assessment Skane, Remissgatan 4, S-22185 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital,"Löfvendahl, S (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Fac Med, Orthoped, Lund, Sweden.;Löfvendahl, S (通讯作者)，Skane Univ Hosp, Hlth Technol Assessment Skane, Lund, Sweden.;Löfvendahl, S (通讯作者)，Skane Univ Hosp, Hlth Technol Assessment Skane, Remissgatan 4, S-22185 Lund, Sweden.",sofia.lofvendahl@med.lu.se,"Jöud, Anna/AAA-3277-2022","Petersson, Ingemar/0000-0001-9139-1892; Lofvendahl, Sofia/0000-0001-7988-757X",,,,,50,8,8,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This is problematic in cases where spillover health effects are substantial, such as when the application of new technology alters environmental exposures. When health externalities are included in return on investment calculations, energy efficiency programs may look more or less attractive than suggested by conventional energy savings only estimates. This analysis exploits the quasi-experiment provided by the 2009 Los Angeles (LA) LED streetlight efficiency program to investigate the returns on investments inclusive of an originally estimated health externality. Using the synthetic control method, we find that the LED streetlight program is associated with a lagged increase in breast cancer mortality of 0.479 per 100,000. Inclusive of the effects of LEDs on breast cancer and avoided carbon emissions, the LA LED program provides a - 146.2% 10-year return compared to +118.2% when health outcomes and carbon emissions are ignored.

To maintain the current forest covers is a complex endeavor, there is a wide variety of ecosystems that compete with other land uses, there is also large volumes of tropical timber sold in the market that serve to reduce poverty, and a large number of forest dwellers pursuing different benefits from the forest. The objective of this study was to understand stakeholders' values about Colombian forest legislation and its implications for legal timber trade. Participants of this study represented stakeholders from the three forest regions that produce 71% of the total timber from natural stands. By using Q methodology, a technique that combines qualitative and quantitative methods to systematically study subjectivity, four distinct perspectives were found. These perspectives show the complexity to enforce the law because this does not include regional particularities, there are high levels of bureaucracy as a product of the previous factor; there is also a lack of quality in the forest management plans and government transparency. Although the management of natural resources of Colombia is decentralized, forest legislation is part of a comprehensive national legal system that does not consider the wide variety of forest types that require different forestry practices and serve several social needs. This implies that effective compliance with forest law rests on a devolution of the legislation that could include particularities of each forest productive region.","[Sandra, Rodriguez-Pineros] Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Periferico Francisco R Almada Km 1, Chihuahua 33820, Mexico; [Oscar, Martinez-Cortes] Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, 33 Willcocks St 418, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada; [Liz, Villarraga-Florez] Univ Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas, Fac Medio Ambiente & Recursos Nat, Carrera 5 Este 15-82, Bogota, Colombia; [Alejandra, Ruiz-Diaz] Minist Ambiente & Desarrollo, Calle 37 8-40, Bogota, Colombia",University of Toronto; Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas,"Sandra, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Periferico Francisco R Almada Km 1, Chihuahua 33820, Mexico.",spineros@uach.mx; o.martinezcortes@mail.utoronto.ca; lizv@udistrital.edu.co; rruiz@minambiente.gov.co,"Rodriguez, Sandra/JFA-6890-2023","Martinez Cortes, Oscar Geovani/0000-0002-3637-8406; Villarraga Florez, Liz Farleidy/0000-0001-8992-4792",Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible of Colombia; ONF-Andina [CPS-5094],Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible of Colombia; ONF-Andina,Funding for this work was supported by Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible of Colombia and the ONF-Andina (CPS-5094).,,94,12,12,1,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAR,2018,88.0,,,,,,1,10,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.12.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FW0DO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424961800001,0

Severe cases of RSV require hospitalisation as well as admission to intensive care and may even result in death. The objective of the study was to measure the net benefits that could arise from an immunisation programme of infants that may well eradicate RSV to a high degree and save the direct and indirect medical care costs from hospitalisation, morbidity and the gain from potential life-time earnings by reducing the probability of mortality. In this context, the majority of existing empirical investigations are based on data from clinical trials, and where relevant facts are not available, a series of strong assumptions is derived from the published literature, whereas in this study, for the first time, the hospital episode statistics database is used to calculate the cost-benefit ratios. The methodology of the analysis adopts a cost-benefit approach to assess the impact of the immunisation and whether it is beneficial to society. The underlying assumptions of the basic model are assessed by adopting a sensitivity analysis. The results show that a number of categories are cost-effective with the use of the passive drug, which means benefits by raising the life expectancy and quality as well as reducing the resource burden on society.","[Thomas, Gareth] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Thomas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",d.g.thomas@herts.ac.uk,,,University of Hertfordshire,University of Hertfordshire,"We wish to acknowledge the grant of 10,000 pound from the University of Hertfordshire to carry out the study and purchase the HES data set.

Therefore, local governments have made the restoration and protection of ecosystems a major policy issue. However, such efforts will only be successful if local communities participate. Using cross-sectional data on 612 smallholder rubber farmers in Xishuangbanna, this study investigates the willingness of smallholder rubber farmers to participate in ecosystem protection. We employ a multivariate probit regression model to estimate three ways of participating in environmental protection: (i) through monetary contributions of rubber farmers, (ii) by reducing rubber areas, and (iii) through the provision of free labor. The results show that most rubber farmers are willing to participate in local ecosystem protection. While wealthier households tend to participate by contributing money and providing free labor, poorer households prefer to reduce their rubber planting areas. Approximately 10% of the farmers believe that rubber cultivation has positive environmental effects and therefore abstain from participating in ecosystem protection measures. Our findings have important implications for policymakers who want to implement programs to restore and protect ecosystems in Xishuangbanna and other rubber planting regions in southern China.","[Min, Shi; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Bai, Junfei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 17 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Waibel, Hermann] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Gebaude 1503,Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Peking University; China Agricultural University; Leibniz University Hannover,"Min, S (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Agr Policy, Sch Adv Agr Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",min.ccap@pku.edu.cn,,,"Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft, Technologie and Forschung (BMBF) [FKZ: 01LL0919]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333013]","Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft, Technologie and Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This study was conducted in the framework of the Sino-German SURUMER Project, funded by the Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft, Technologie and Forschung (BMBF), FKZ: 01LL0919.

This paper analyses the extent to which the concept of 'Learning Organization' exists in the public sector in Romania, the current learning capacity of the organizations in this sector and the impact of the concept at organizational level. As research instrument, the questionnaire designed by Bruce Britton (1998) 'The Learning NGO' was applied within six public organizations.

These shocks are identified using sign restrictions derived from predictions of an open economy general equilibrium model calibrated to China's economy. We find that foreign demand shocks are the most important driving force of China's real exchange rate, which explains approximately 20% to 40% of the variance in 20 quarters. It is in line with the findings in the literature which show real demand shocks are the key contributor to fluctuations in the real exchange rate.

Overall, reduced care services have created care deficits for disadvantaged groups, including low-income rural elderly and children. The shifted care burden has also limited women's ability to participate fully in the market economy and has contributed to rising gender inequalities in labor force participation, off-farm employment, earnings, pensions, and mental health outcomes.","[Connelly, Rachel] Bowdoin Coll Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Jacobsen, Joyce] Wesleyan Univ Econ, Publ Affairs Ctr, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Zhao, Yaohui] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of Winnipeg; Peking University,"Connelly, R (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",e-connelly@bowdoin.edu; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; jjacobsen@wesleyan.edu; yhzhao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023","Zhao, Yaohui/0000-0002-9252-9715",International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada [107579]; Ford Foundation China; UN Women China; Rice University; University of Utah; Colorado State University,International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada; Ford Foundation China; UN Women China; Rice University; University of Utah; Colorado State University,"The studies in this volume were performed with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada (Project no. 107579).

This article deals with the developments of this issue from the ancient Greek scholar Archimedes who (although ancient Greeks were scared stiff of infinity) probably lay the foundations of integral calculus by the exhaustion method. In Middle Ages, the considerations of infinitely small quantities caught the eyes of Nemorarius, Bradwardin, and Oresme. At the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries the considerations of infinitesimal calculus were on agenda of Kepler and Galilei. And then there followed the era of Newton and Leibnitz who realized that differential calculus and integral calculus are mutually opposing procedures.","[Coufal, Jan; Tobisek, Jiri] Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9a, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",,"Coufal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9a, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",jan.coufal@vsem.cz; jiri.tobisek@vsem.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,297,306,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400029,0

In the article the analysis of structure and dynamics for the examined term was applied. The most important conclusions are that pro-social, nationwide initiatives of budgetary expenditure after 2016 have had a negative impact on the agricultural sector in terms of the expenditure allocated to it; the level of expenditure for the agricultural sector from the national budget is unstable and has been declining since 2016.

Second, it is anchored in a complex system of communication aiming for the production and dissemination of experiences through media production.","[Dumont, Guillaume] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Sociol Vida Quotidiana & Treball QUIT, Fac Ciencies Polit & Sociol, Barcelona, Spain; [Dumont, Guillaume] OBS Business Sch, Dept Management, Av Gran Via Hosp 16-20, Barcelona 08902, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Dumont, G (通讯作者)，OBS Business Sch, Dept Management, Av Gran Via Hosp 16-20, Barcelona 08902, Spain.",guidumo@gmail.com,"dumont, guillaume/Q-1432-2019","dumont, guillaume/0000-0002-2473-5488",,,,,54,3,4,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Using an econometric model of monthly plant-level electricity generation levels between 2001 and 2012, we estimate the effect of water scarcity on the US electricity fuel mix. We find that hydroelectric generation decreases substantially in response to drought, although this baseline generation is offset primarily by natural gas, depending on the geographic region. We provide empirical evidence that drought can increase emissions of CO2 and local pollutants. We quantify the social costs of water scarcity to be $330,000 per month for each plant that experiences a one-standard deviation increase in water scarcity (2015 dollars), a relationship that persists under future projections of water scarcity.

The process of the formulation of the Regional Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialization (RIS3) for 2014-2020 has been completed. And, as is apparent from the analysis of RIS3 documents and supporting documents for the Polish regions, the strategies are the result of cooperation among key stakeholders of the regional scene. However, as shown by the indicators, e.g.: the level of participation in public consultations (low frequency), and observations of participation in research and expert groups (high frequency of refusal to participate in research), this cooperation was of a rather passive and incidental nature (especially on the part of business and society). Given that for the next few years the regions will implement, monitor and modify the objectives of RIS3, there is a need to undertake actions in order to activate these social groups and develop mechanisms to support the continuity and regularity of cooperation.","[Fabinska, Monika] Univ Lodz, Dept Entrepreneurship & Ind Policy, Fac Management, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Fabinska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Entrepreneurship & Ind Policy, Fac Management, Lodz, Poland.",monika.fabinska@uni.lodz.pl,"Fabińska, Monika/AAP-7731-2021; Fabinska, Monika/Y-9725-2018","Fabinska, Monika/0000-0001-9084-0086",,,,,41,1,1,1,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-76288-3; 978-3-319-76287-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,9.0,,,,,,289,302,,10.1007/978-3-319-76288-3_22,0.0,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525862100022,0

This study examines this effect in 26 emerging markets over the period of 2005-2013 with a special attention to the recent global financial crisis. We find a stronger asset growth effect during the crisis years relative to other years. This effect is stronger in firms with small or medium stock turnover ratio and firms operating in industries with low R&D intensity. We also investigate the heterogeneity across countries and find that a stronger asset growth effect during the crisis years exists only for emerging markets with low protection of shareholders and creditors.

We report two major results. First, emerging and developing economies built fiscal space in the run-up to the Great Recession of 2008-2009, which was then used for stimulus. Since then, fiscal space has shrunk and remains narrow as these economies have taken advantage of historically low interest rates. Second, fiscal policy in emerging and developing economies has become countercyclical (or less procyclical), i.e., graduated, since the 1980s, as most clearly demonstrated during the Great Recession. The move towards graduation is most pronounced for those economies with greater fiscal space, which suggests that fiscal space matters for a government's ability to implement countercyclical fiscal policy.","[Huidrom, Raju; Kose, M.

International migration represents a process currently being into full expansion, process which has seen many approaches. The main question which reality imposes over migration is whether it can bring more benefits or if it is a burden on both sending and the receiving countries. The following article aims to answer affirmatively or negatively to each of the two scenarios and, also, to see the implications of this process for both the receiving countries and the sending ones. The research design and methodology starts from understanding the core of how migration works and its main features, so that readers may have an idea of how to understand the statistics which will be presented. The key findings of this paper should be the ones regarding profiling the current migrants and presenting the main benefits and risks for both countries of origin and destination. Many times migration is usually perceived as a process that leads to drops of wages, therefore it might create discomfort among native people already working in certain areas. Of course global competition means cutting costs, and that might mean cheaper workforce. But there is a much larger understanding behind this dynamic process. Migration policies play a huge role into the acceptance and integration of migrants. Finally, it is important to understand that migration, both voluntary and forced, is one of the key elements behind the economic globalization, and therefore should be analyzed not just in terms of numbers, but in terms of a deeper understanding so that researchers may finally give answers to its necessity in certain areas, and the proper tools to either eradicate, sustain or even encourage it.","[Jaradat, Mohammad; Iurian, Sergiu-Dan] Valahia Univ Targoviste, 2 Carol I Blvd, Targoviste 130024, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste,"Jaradat, M (通讯作者)，Valahia Univ Targoviste, 2 Carol I Blvd, Targoviste 130024, Romania.",jaradat_hadi@yahoo.com; iurian_sergiu@yahoo.com,"JARADAT, Mohammad/AAK-8603-2021",,,,,,12,0,0,1,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,520,527,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200046,0

The period covered by this study is 1995-2015. The research was based on outcomes reported by main players of the global market. The basic source of data were online databases and reports. Once collected, the data was analysed with the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Selected statistical methods, indices of structure and dynamics, indicators of economic openness and indicators related to three dimensions of security (availability, access and stability) were used. The analysis resulted in numerous conclusions. In the study period, food imports followed a global growth trend with alternating periods of contrasting developments. In the countries covered by this study, the openness of trade in food was higher than that of global imports and followed a growth trend. The singularities of the development of the agri-food sector were reflected in decreasing values of the exports-to-imports ratio, and were decisive for the positive growth rate of per capita agri-food output. According to the analysis of relationships between changes in trade levels and selected food security indicators, imports proved to be positively correlated with physical and economic availability, and negatively correlated with stability. Based on the results, a general conclusion may be drawn that economic growth resulted in structural changes which contributed to improving access to food.","[Jaworska, Magdalena] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Jaworska, M (通讯作者)，Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",jaworska@up.poznan.pl,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,5,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,245,251,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.32,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600032,0

These features have a significant impact on the market and price behaviour. As a result of the lack of storage capacity sharp movements of electricity prices are often observed. An ability of modelling and forecasting jumps and spikes plays the crucial role in risk management. In the paper, the logistic regression is employed to predict spike occurrences. We investigate the impact of fundamental variables such as demand, weather and seasonal factors, on spikes occurrences. The point and interval theoretical probabilities are calculated. The classification accuracy is assessed by means of the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC measures. In our research we detect spikes using a quantile technique and a Bayesian DEJD model. We state that the logistic regression is a quite good tool to forecast moments of a spike occurrence. The logistic regression model is a well-known specification which seems to be reasonable tool of spike prediction.","[Kostrzewska, Jadwiga] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Kostrzewski, Maciej] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Kostrzewska, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",jadwiga.kostrzewska@uek.krakow.pl; maciej.kostrzewski@uek.krakow.pl,"Kostrzewska, Jadwiga/L-3238-2018; Kostrzewski, Maciej/K-1517-2012","Kostrzewska, Jadwiga/0000-0002-6142-9156; Kostrzewski, Maciej/0000-0003-1544-4221","National Science Centre, Poland [2016/23/B/HS4/03018]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research is funded by the National Science Centre, Poland (grant no. 2016/23/B/HS4/03018).",,9,2,2,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,219,228,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.22,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700022,0

We combine data on annual household flood insurance purchases for the United States over the period 2000-2011 with data from the two main U.S. post disaster federal aid programs (FEMA's Individual Assistance grants and SBA's low interest disaster loans). Estimating both fixed -effects and instrumental variable models to account for the endogeneity of disaster assistance grants, we find that receiving individual assistance grants decreases the average quantity of insurance purchased the following year by between $4000 and $5000. The reduction we find is roughly 3% of the mean insurance coverage in the sample but larger than the average flood-related IA grant in our sample, which is $2984. IA,is currently limited and larger grants could have different impacts. The crowding out is on the intensive margin; we find no impact on take-up rates, likely because there is a requirement that recipients of disaster aid purchase an insurance policy. We do not know how take-up rates might change without such a requirement. Low interest post-disaster government loans have no systematic effect on insurance purchases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, it requires in-depth analyses. The main aim of the presented study is to assess the diversity of the situation of women working in agriculture across the EU. The quantitative analysis allows to indicate similarities and differences among EU states in the current structure of women's employment in this sector. In the analysis, the k-mean method is applied with the Labour Force Survey data from the year 2016. The study refers to 28 EU states and a group of women aged 20-64. The obtained results indicated that we have a large proportion of self-employees in agriculture. However, we observe a larger percentage of those who create jobs for others states that are better economically developed. This analysis confirms the findings that the Polish structure of female employment is closer to those in the Mediterranean countries. Poland is assigned to one cluster with Greece. This group is distinguished by several factors. Firstly, it contains a high proportion of people employed in agriculture with a relatively small share of part-timers. Secondly, it is a very high rate of self-employed with a very low proportion of those who create jobs for others.","[Matuszewska-Janica, Aleksandra] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Appl Informat & Math, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Matuszewska-Janica, A (通讯作者)，Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",aleksandra_matuszewska@sggw.pl,"Matuszewska-Janica, Aleksandra/D-4520-2015","Matuszewska-Janica, Aleksandra/0000-0001-9127-6034",National Science Centre [2015/17/B//HS4/00930],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",Research is conducted in the frame of project financed by National Science Centre grant 2015/17/B//HS4/00930.,,23,0,0,0,2,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-803-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,124,129,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.2.15,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502418600015,0

Achieving of this effect is strictly related to the size of the network. Therefore, the success of a company on the network market is the result of the value of supplied goods and services, but the dynamics of the growth of a network. This paper shows the process of 'network feeding' as a part of competitive strategy suitable for the enterprises operating on the network market. Feeding the network is understood here as a range of activities, which lead to the fastest possible expansion of the network which is used for creating and delivering goods and services. Those activities are meant to overcome competition in the race for a critical mass of the network. Following network feeding strategies are analysed in the paper: USB Forum on the market of computer accessories, Tesla Motors on the market of electric cars and Spotify on the market for music streaming services.","[Mazurek, Szymon] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Mazurek, S (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",szymon.mazurek@ue.wroc.pl,"Mazurek, Szymon/B-7725-2018",,,,,,13,1,1,2,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1195,1204,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400119,0

Highly gifted people represent the core of Creative Industries (CI), especially in video games studios e.g.: computer specialists, animation programmer, concept artist, combat designers, creative audio director. Their activities are based on creativity. CI was defined as the activities which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent as well as open the potential for wealth and job creation by generating and taking advantage of intellectual property. It is of crucial importance to establish such working environment which enhances creativity. Creativity is fundamental for innovation processes the effects of which are increasingly complicated and complex. The activities characteristic for enterprises operating in the sector of creative industries are initiated based on the individual creativity of talented, open and competent workers.

Empirical findings on both organizational cultures and structures, and a set of typical routines for managing unanticipated situations using eight case vignettes are presented. Results show that successful project-oriented organizations tend to relax structures and empower teams when confronted with sudden events in the detection phase. Once the decision on actions needed to address the turbulence is made, smart organizations swiftly rebound to formalized hierarchies and clear communication structures in the recovery phase, allowing for quick and coordinated action. Thus, combining centralization with decentralization along the timeline of resilient action is one of the cornerstones to smart project organizing.","[Nachbagauer, Andreas G.

Surprisingly, main stream economics responds to it superficially, it obviously does not perceive connection between the two challenges and does not accepted the J.K. Galbraith claim that technological progress is the bases for economic and social change. From my point of view presented in this paper, the challenges are apparent. In fact, it is only the culmination of the process that begun in the late 1930s in the U.S.A. and approximately twenty years later in developed part of Europe and that J.K. Galbraith would call the affluently society. Since people have been living in the society where to create needs is the only means of achieving growth of wealth which is still an ultimate measure of progress. We live under the dictatorship of consumption and economic growth driven by multinational corporations. Right now, at the moment when we hit the boundaries of this stereotype, the Galbraith's visions, especially his concept of forced consumption and post-industrial society, can be very inspiring.","[Rusmichova, Lada] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Katedra Mikroekon, Podnikohospodarka Fak, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13064 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rusmichová, L (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Katedra Mikroekon, Podnikohospodarka Fak, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13064 3, Czech Republic.",rusmichl@vse.cz,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1516,1525,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400150,0

First, financial cycles occur less frequently than business cycles. Second, the upturn phase of a financial cycle is significantly longer than the downturn phase. Third, gross domestic product growth rates are at their lowest when the two cycles are in troughs and the highest when they reach their peaks. We find similar results for employment, inflation, and consumption rates. Fourth, financial cycles lead business cycles but not vice versa.

Previous research mostly investigated customer perceptions, leaving employee perceptions in the sidelines and accordingly neglecting employee importance. In this context, one more gap is related to attempts to understand the impact of CSR on organizational outcomes. While many studies typically examined the impact of CSR on financial performance or customer satisfaction, scarce research has been done to find the influence of CSR on employees. Although recently the number of studies linking CSR and employee-related outcomes has been growing, nevertheless employee attitudes, such as organizational commitment or job satisfaction, dominate; meanwhile employee behavior, including organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), receives less attention. Thus, the linkage between CSR and OCB remains largely unexplored, whereas OCB can be a source of competitive advantage. Trying to close the gap, the paper aims at revealing the relationship between employee perceptions of CSR and OCB. In doing this, quantitative data were collected (307 responses in total). Consistent with the expectations, the survey indicated that employee perceptions of CSR directed at four main stakeholder groups, namely social and non-social stakeholders, employees, customers and government, had a positive effect on OCB. As regards relationship based on separate dimensions of OCB, distinct findings were revealed. As it was expected, employee perceptions of CSR towards customers and also towards government have a positive effect on each of five OCB dimensions. Slightly different findings appeared in cases of employee perceptions of CSR towards social and non-social stakeholders and also towards employees. As regards the first case, no statistically significant relationship between perceptions and altruism and sportsmanship was found. Meanwhile in the second case, no statistically significant relationship with sportsmanship was discovered. Generally, the provided result underlines the necessity for business to invest not only in CSR, but also in employee perceptions of CSR, as this could drive extra-role employee behavior, namely OCB.","[Stankeviciute, Zivile] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino G 50, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Wereda, Wioletta] Mil Univ Technol, Sylwestra Kaliskiego 2, PL-01476 Warsaw, Poland",Kaunas University of Technology; Military University of Technology in Warsaw,"Stankeviciute, Z (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino G 50, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Zivile.stankeviciute@ktu.lt; weredawioletta@tlen.pl,"Wereda, Wioletta/ABC-1459-2020; Wereda, Wioletta S/S-4342-2018; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/I-6551-2018","Wereda, Wioletta/0000-0002-6948-0239; Stankevičiūtė, Živilė/0000-0002-5578-4645",,,,,52,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,1040,1054,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200089,0

Competitiveness of an enterprise can be described by means of three dimensions (groups of variables): competitive standing, competitive potential, and competitive strategy (instruments of competing). This paper is designed to determine measures of maximum importance to evaluation of an enterprise's competitive potential. Its theoretical section is a critical review of literature concerning microeconomic conditions of enterprise competitiveness. Determining competitive potential of an enterprise serves to assess level of its competitiveness. The potential is understood as tangible and intangible resources that enable an enterprise to build its competitive advantage and to operate effectively in a market. The empirical part discusses results of the author's research, using the Delphi method with 55 Polish and international experts (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Spain, the US), aimed at determining significance of measures of enterprise competitive potential. Two research hypotheses concerning significance of the individual measures of an enterprise's competitive potential are posited in the article.

We propose a new risk measure (thereafter called CVaRMD) that synthesizes the mean and median deviation of the hedged portfolio loss to trace the extreme risk. The classical volatility models (GARCH-n, GARCH-t, GJR-n and GJR-t) are commonly-used in finance literature to depict the marginal distributions of the oil price and the exchange rate. Different from the time-consuming method of simulation, we employ Copula functions to deduce the cumulative distribution function of the hedged portfolio and then to calculate the extreme risk. Empirical studies demonstrate that GARCH-n and GARCH-t models are better to forecast the volatilities of Brent crude oil price and the exchange rate (CNY/USD)respectively. Frank copula better portrays the correlation structure between Brent crude oil price and the exchange rate. We find that hedging with crude oil options can reduce the extreme risk effectively. By comparing the skewness of the extreme loss under two risk measures of Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and CVaRMD, we find that the left deviation degree of the extreme loss under CVaRMD criterion is greater. The result of variance analysis further confirms this conclusion. That is to say, based on the strategy of minimizing CVaRMD, the extreme loss risk that the firm faces is relatively smaller. We further analyze the parameter sensitivities and give the firm some suggestions to choose the appropriate option contracts and decide its budget.","[Yu, Xing] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiguo; Liu, Yongjun] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University; South China University of Technology,"Yu, X (通讯作者)，Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yuxing@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; wgzhang@mail.scut.edu.cn; bmyjliu@mail.scut.edu.cn,,"Liu, Yong-Jun/0000-0002-1728-480X",Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71720107002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501076]; Natural Science Fund of Guangdong [2014A030310454]; Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China [2018116]; Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund from Ministry of Education [16YJAZH078]; Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base of Guangzhou,Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Fund of Guangdong(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China; Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund from Ministry of Education; Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base of Guangzhou,"This paper is supported by Funds for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71720107002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71501076), Natural Science Fund of Guangdong (No.2014A030310454), Financial Service Innovation and Risk Management Research Base of Guangzhou, Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China(No.2018116),Humanities and Social Science Planning Fund from Ministry of Education(Grant No. 16YJAZH078).",,18,3,3,1,28,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In a narrow sense this encompasses the growth of knowledge-intensive industries such as information technology, telecommunications and biotechnology. However, it is also becoming increasingly important in many other 'traditional' industries and there are indications that the knowledge content of work generally is increasing. The relevance of research is in the contribution of domestic economic science to building market relations, the sustainable and balanced development of the national economy in the face of global economic challenges, as well as the development of new scientific directions, concepts and models that are adequate to world trends and determine the construction of a knowledge economy. The main idea of this research is to analyze the existing literature on research in the field of formation and development of a knowledge-based economy. In this paper, we examined in detail the existing literature related to the direction and depth of the development of a knowledge-based economy, indicating the most influential scientists, journals and relevant publications according to the most well-known Web of Science database. As the study of literary sources on the problems of the development of a knowledge-based economy shows, there is still no unequivocal opinion among researchers about its parameters and the depth of research. There are gaps that can be identified by analyzing existing literature. Knowledge economy is not just a new theoretical concept, but a new epoch, which has a fundamental difference from the era of the agrarian and industrial economy. Although its offensive appeared only in the early 90s, it already had an impact and caused changes in all spheres of economic and social life, and this influence is constantly growing. The trend of development of a Knowledge economy is the formation of a Knowledge economy, which will mean the onset of a new stage in the development of the global economy, namely, the stage of global economic networks. For Practitioners, this is valuable in that it is possible to determine the existing practice in the study of problems of development and development of a knowledge-based economy, as well as positive experience for the leaders of knowledge-based companies.","[Zhuparova, Aziza; Sagiyeva, Rimma; Kalmakova, Dinara] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, 71 Al Farabi Ave, Alma Ata 050000, Kazakhstan",Al-Farabi Kazakh National University,"Zhuparova, A (通讯作者)，Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, 71 Al Farabi Ave, Alma Ata 050000, Kazakhstan.",aziza_z@mail.ru; sagi5@mail.ru; kalmakova@mail.ru,"Zhuparova, Aziza/JNF-0699-2023; Kalmakova, Dinara/ABD-8538-2022",,Ministry of Education and Science [AP05131314],"Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))",This research was funded by the Ministry of Education and Science.

Despite the devastating economic burden of injuries, in India, there is limited data available on injury epidemiology. This paper aims to, first, examine the socio-economic differentials in Out of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) on accidental injury; second, to look into the level of Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE) at different threshold levels; and last, to explore the adjusted effect of various socio-economic covariates on the level of CHE. Methods: Data was extracted from the key indicators of social consumption in India: Health, National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), conducted by the Government of India during January-June-2014. Logistic regression analysis was employed to analyse the various covariates of OOPE and CHE associated to accidental injury. Findings: Binary Logistic analysis has demonstrated a significant association between socioeconomic status of the households and the level of OOPE and CHE on accidental injury care. People who used private health services incurred 16 times higher odds of CHE than those who availed public facilities. The result shows that if the person is covered via any type of insurance, the odd of CHE was lower by about 28% than the uninsured. Longer duration of stay and death due to accidental injury was positively associated with higher level of OOPE. Economic status, nature of healthcare facility availed and regional affiliation significantly influence the level of OOPE and CHE. Conclusion: Despite numerous efforts by the Central and State governments to reduce the financial burden of healthcare, large number of households are still paying a significant amount from their own pockets. There are huge differentials in cost for the treatment among public and private healthcare providers for accidental injury. It is expected that the findings would provide insights into the prevailing magnitude of accidental injuries in India, the profile of the population affected, and the level of OOPE among households.","[Pradhan, Jalandhar; Dwivedi, Rinshu] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Rourkela 769008, Orissa, India; [Pati, Sanghamitra] Reg Med Res Ctr, Bhubaneswar 751023, Orissa, India; [Rout, Sarit Kumar] Indian Inst Publ Hlth PHFI, Bhubaneswar 751024, Orissa, India","National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Rourkela; Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); ICMR - Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar; Public Health Foundation of India","Dwivedi, R (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Rourkela 769008, Orissa, India.",rinshudwivedi999@gmail.com,"Pradhan, Jalandhar/HIK-1917-2022; Dwivedi, Rinshu/D-1690-2019; Pradhan, Jalandhar/N-1820-2017","Rout, Sarit/0000-0003-0831-789X; Pradhan, Jalandhar/0000-0001-5998-0363","Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela","Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela","The authors are grateful to the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Rourkela for their support and encouragement, which has helped in improving this paper.

We test whether the inspections affect youth access and smoking for boys and girls. Using the 2010-13 Monitoring the Future survey and data on the number and location of inspections in the first several years of the program, we find the checks have been successful at limiting access to cigarettes in small retail establishments. As for reducing smoking, we observe reductions only among girls. Boys continue to smoke with about the same incidence and intensity as before the inspections. The likely reason for this is that girls are generally more successful at purchasing illicit products at retail establishments while underage. Therefore, enforcing the minimum legal age laws for purchasing tobacco products likely curtails the access of girls to the illegal product.","[Abouk, Rahi] William Paterson Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Global Business, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA; [Adams, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Adams, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",sjadams@uwm.edu,"Abouk, Rahi/ABG-3944-2021","Abouk, Rahi/0000-0002-8920-4055",,,,,42,6,6,0,77,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Key catalysts for this were legal and regulatory changes that awarded 180-day exclusivity rights for first-filing generic firms not only on the basis of a court victory, but also through a settlement with the patent owner. In this paper, we have assembled a unique data set on new drugs approved from 1994 to 2006, including detailed information on patent challenges and litigation outcomes. We find that the new regulatory environment induced significant behavioral changes, including racing by generic firms to challenge patents for large-selling drugs in an environment where more patents are filed by branded firms. Increased generic challenges to different types of patent claims are linked to reduced market exclusivity periods for branded drugs, based on regression analyses and litigation outcomes. Settlements that allow entry prior to patent expiry are a prevalent litigation outcome given the risks of an unfavorable court decision that can adversely affect a company's market valuation. This topic remains an important issue for further research, particularly given different public policies governing patent challenges for biosimilars and biologics compared with those for generic drugs and new chemical entities.","[Grabowski, Henry; Brain, Carlos; Taub, Anna; Guha, Rahul] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Grabowski, H (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",grabowsk@duke.edu,,,Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),"We are indebted to Pfizer for providing IMS Health data and support to undertake this analysis.

Landscape approaches to REDD + are assumed to be better able to tackle direct and indirect drivers of deforestation, particularly those that lie outside the forest sector. In assessing this promise, our paper has a two-fold objective: first, to develop a typology of landscape approaches to REDD + discernible in the literature; and second, to assess which approach might be ascendant in the particular context of Madagascar, and whether it has the potential to address direct and indirect drivers of deforestation and forest degradation here. Our analysis of the burgeoning REDD + landscape literature yields a typology of landscape approaches, which we characterise here as economic, political and ecological. In assessing which of these approaches is discernible in Madagascar, we find that an ecological conceptualisation has emerged. While such an approach shows some promise in addressing drivers, in comparison to previous integrated conservation and development approaches (ICDP) that pre-date REDD +, it is nonetheless still limited in its ability to do so. Hurdles include lack of inter-sectoral coordination and national-level political support for combating deforestation, as well as lack of community engagement in multilevel political processes. We conclude by highlighting the promise and limitations of pursuing a landscape approach to REDD + in Madagascar, and the relevance of our analysis for other REDD + countries wherein an ecological landscape approach might be considered.","[Weatherley-Singh, Janice; Gupta, Aarti] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp ENP, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Weatherley-Singh, Janice] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Blvd Louis Schmidt 64, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",Wageningen University & Research,"Weatherley-Singh, J (通讯作者)，Wildlife Conservat Soc, Blvd Louis Schmidt 64, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",jweatherleysingh@wcs.org,,,,,,,79,7,8,0,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,DEC,2017,85.0,,1.0,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.08.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR3SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418986200001,0

The objective is to eliminate financial barriers associated with the use of services. But studies elsewhere showed that out of pocket (OOP) payments still exist in the midst of fee exemptions. The aim of this study was to estimate OOP payments and the financial impact on women during childbirth in one rural and poor area of Northern Ghana; the Kassena-Nankana municipality. Costs were taken from the perspective of women. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques were used in a convergent parallel mixed methods study. The study used structured questionnaire (n = 353) and focus group discussions (FGDs = 7) to collect data from women who gave birth in health facilities. Quantitative data from the questionnaire were analysed, using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data from the FGDs were recorded, transcribed and analysed to determine common themes. Results: The overall mean OOP payments during childbirth was GH(sic)33.50 (US$17), constituting 5.6% of the average monthly household income. Over one-third (36%, n = 145) of women incurred OOP payments which exceeded 10% of average monthly household income (potentially catastrophic). Sixty-nine percent (n = 245) of the women perceived that the NHIS did not cover all expenses incurred during childbirth; which was confirmed in the FGDs. Both survey and FGDs demonstrated that women made OOP payments for drugs and other supplies. The FGDs showed women bought disinfectants, soaps, rubber pads and clothing for newborns as well. Seventy-five percent (n = 264) of the women used savings, but 19% had to sell assets to finance the payments; this was supported in the FGDs. Conclusion: The NHIS policy has not eliminated financial barriers associated with childbirth which impacts the welfare of some women. Women continued to make OOP payments, largely as a result of a delay in reimbursement by the NHIS. There is need to re-examine the reimbursement system in order to prevent shortage of funding to health facilities and thus encourage skilled attendance for the reduction of maternal deaths as well as the achievement of universal health coverage.","[Dalinjong, Philip Ayizem; Wang, Alex Y.; Homer, Caroline S.

We start from the position that the ascent of the increasingly corporatized university is deeply problematic precisely because of the neoliberal realist position on 'the future' that it assumes and perpetuates: the view that there is no alternative to neoliberal capitalist market principles, that present and future realities can diverge only to the extent permitted by existing market forces and rationales (Amsler, 2011). In this context, 'education' takes the form of preparing and socializing the next generation of workers: a future focus severely limited in the possibilities it considers. Thus we are faced with a mutually-constitutive relationship where constrained visions of future needs and demands serve to constrain present educational offerings; a dynamic which becomes self-reinforcing and which admits little disruption. In this paper, we draw on the concrete body of practice known as action research to consider how we might prize open spaces for thinking much more expansively about what 'the future' might entail, and what forms of education and organization are necessary in the present to keep open, rather than shut down, diverse possibilities and democratic debate around this. We focus on critical utopian action research and systemic action research as illustrative of key qualities of prefigurative and critical utopian engagement with educational presents and futures. We conclude that the capture of the university by neoliberal logics can be resisted and challenged through radical methodologies, like action research, which explicitly set out to be ongoingly anti-hegemonic, critical, self-reflexive, pluralistic, and non-recuperative (Firth, 2013; Garforth, 2009).

We follow a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework to compare health outcomes between people who drink surface water and ground water in regions with different intensities of rice pesticide use before and after 2004, when China shifted from taxing agriculture to subsidizing agricultural programs. The results indicate that a 10% increase in rice pesticide use unfavorably alters a key medical disability index (Activities of Daily Living or ADL) by 1% for rural residents 65 and older. This is equivalent to 2.13 and 0.64 million dollars in medical and family care costs, respectively. Further, we provide suggestive evidence of an intergenerational transfer of caring burden by showing pesticide use reduces out-migration of the offspring in affected households. The results are robust to a variety of robustness checks and falsification tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The findings provide evidences that signalling mechanisms drive the entrepreneurs towards the adoption of FSC certification, followed by moral and ethical reasons. In terms of impact, emerges that companies are compared to higher operation costs necessary to obtain the certification of compliance with the scheme requirements, that are only partially compensated, not by an increase in the selling price of certified products, but by the company's ability to establish new business relationships with a consequent increase in the sales.","[Galati, Antonino; Gianguzzi, Giuseppe; Tinervia, Salvatore; Crescimanno, Maria; La Mela Veca, Donato Salvatore] Univ Palermo, Dept Agr & Forest Sci, Viale Sci,Bldg 4, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Galati, A (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Agr & Forest Sci, Viale Sci,Bldg 4, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",antonino.galati@unipa.it; giuseppe.gianguzzi@unipa.it; salvatore.tinervia03@unipa.it; maria.crescimanno@unipa.it; donato.lamelaveca@unipa.it,"La Mela Veca, Donato Salvatore/F-7039-2013; Galati, Antonino/H-5838-2012","La Mela Veca, Donato Salvatore/0000-0003-0921-0103; Galati, Antonino/0000-0003-0753-2934",,,,,61,45,47,2,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,169,176,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.08.002,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000019,0

To examine and map the position of different interests and influences of actors involved in medicinal plant usage, this paper uses a power grid matrix. The analysis confirms that five of the ten aforementioned actors play a direct role in the medicinal plant policy process, while five actors do not and can be categorized as context setters, subjects, or crowd. This paper ends by recommending a strategy for considering policy options that promote shared interests and minimize anticipated objection from actors concerning the harvest of medicinal plants in MBNP.

In addition, we use student fixed effects models to examine plausibly causal measures of charter school effectiveness.

The study found the following: NTFPs collection activities had become the primary NTFPs business activity engaged in by the worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains because of the relatively small investment needed as well as fewer production and operating risks. The engagement of worker households in the forest areas of Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling Mountains in NTFPs business activities was still in a preliminary stage. Whether or not worker households engaged in NTFPs business activities was not affected by household head or household manpower characteristics; rather, worker households were more willing to engage in NlIPs business activities when the households had bank deposits, homes were close to the woodlands, the woodlands had good quality soil, and the households received social services.

To date, the evidence whether adaptivity improves learning outcomes is limited and mixed. A large-scale randomized control trial is conducted in Dutch secondary schools to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive practice program relative to a static program. Learning theories predict that adaptive practicing is more effective, but this experimental evaluation provides a more nuanced picture. Relative to the static software environment, students working in the adaptive software environment receive more difficult exercises, practice longer and answer fewer questions correctly. Takeup and usage of the software program is, overall, modest, but varies considerably within and between classrooms. The outcome differences between both environments are more pronounced in classrooms with higher practice intensity. On average, no test score effects are found, but static practicing does improve test scores for higher ability students (0.08 sigma). Caution is thus warranted when adaptive practice software is implemented to address individual learning needs, as static formative test preparation can be more effective in improving test scores.

Students learn more when they have an opportunity to review their mistakes, an objective to which online homework systems contribute substantially. But the effectiveness of online assessments depends on the ability to obtain feedback, which often comes in the form of automated written explanations. This paper tests the efficacy of an alternative form of feedback: narrated feedback, consisting of short narrated videos providing verbal and visual explanations of a specific concept. We conduct a field experiment in a large enrollment microeconomic principles course in which students are randomly assigned to either a control group that received no feedback or a treatment group receiving either written or narrated feedback. We provide evidence that students with access to narrated feedback scored on average up to 10.1% higher on assessment questions relative to those with access to written or no feedback.","[Chiang, Eric P.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Vazquez, Jose J.] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Chiang, EP (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",chiang@fau.edu; vazquezj@illinois.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

The European Union joined as a complainant in June 2013. To some degree, this dispute follows earlier ones involving China, as similar procedural and substantial issues were raised in previous cases. However, this was the first time that the WTO Panel rejected some important claims, only for those decisions to be reversed by the Appellate Body.

While students benefit from better peers on average, low-achieving students are harmed by high-achieving peers. Analyzing students' course evaluations suggests that peer effects are driven by improved group interaction rather than adjustments in teachers' behavior or students' effort. Building on Angrist's research, we further show that classical measurement error in a setting where group assignment is systematic can lead to a substantial overestimation of peer effects. However, when group assignment is randomlike in our settingpeer effect estimates are biased toward zero.","[Feld, Jan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Zoelitz, Ulf] IZA, Behav & Inequal Res Inst Briq, Bonn, Germany; [Zoelitz, Ulf] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Victoria University Wellington; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Maastricht University,"Zölitz, U (通讯作者)，IZA, Behav & Inequal Res Inst Briq, Bonn, Germany.;Zölitz, U (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",zoelitz@iza.org,,"Zoelitz, Ulf/0000-0003-0770-6236; Feld, Jan/0000-0003-3816-6607",,,,,22,119,133,16,71,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

We find that teachers generally respond to increased workload by decreasing their rate of absence. Teachers are less likely to be absent when they are teaching larger classes, have new grade assignments or have fewer years of experience. Moreover, we show that when teachers change schools, their absence rate quickly gravitates towards the mean absence rate of their new school, suggesting that school-level factors are an important determinant of absence rates. Finally, we show that the inverse relationship between workload and absence may lead researchers to underestimate the ceteris paribus effect of certain teacher inputs. We illustrate this point in the context of estimating the effect of teacher experience on test scores and show that controlling for absence rates increases the estimated returns to experience by approximately 10%.

IQWiG conducted a pilot study to examine whether discrete choice experiments (DCEs) can be applied in health economic evaluations in Germany to identify, weight, and prioritize multiple patient-relevant outcomes, using the example of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C (HCV). A further objective was to contribute to a more structured approach towards eliciting and comparing preferences across key stakeholders. In autumn 2010, a DCE questionnaire was sent to patients with chronic HCV to estimate preferences across seven outcomes (attributes), including treatment efficacy [sustained viral response (SVR) at 6 months], adverse effects (flu-like symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and skin symptoms/alopecia), and measures of treatment burden (duration of therapy, frequency of injections). A linear model and an effects coded full model were applied to assess the relative importance of the attributes. In total N = 326 patients were included. A clear preference for SVR was shown; frequency of injections and duration of therapy shared the second rank, while psychiatric symptoms ranked third. The duration of flu-like symptoms was the least important attribute. Our findings indicate that it is possible to perform a DCE at the national level in a health technology assessment agency. The weighting of multiple outcomes allows an indication-specific and evidence-based measure to be used in health economic evaluations. In decision-making in health care, the approach generally allows for consideration of patient-relevant trade-offs regarding the benefits and harms of medical interventions.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Bethge, Susanne] Univ Appl Sci Neubrandenburg, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management IGM, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel C.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Ctr Hlth Policy & Inequal Res, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Bridges, John F.

These contributions have been both procedural and substantive. This review seeks to appreciate some of the progress that his work has brought to the field through a review of two of Slaughter's most recent books The Biggest Wake-up Call in History (2010) and To See with Fresh Eyes (2012). This paper traces how Slaughter's intellectual wake-up built up over time. It highlights a set of fundamental tools, ideas and ideals that spring from Slaughter's work over decades and is synthesised in these two books. This appraisal becomes an augmented review by also taking into account his book blurb material and peer-reviewed journal work. This review draws on this evidence to analyse and profile the multi-disciplinary resonance of these references and to illustrate the broader intellectual impact. In addition a bibliometric analysis offers a way beyond the two books and performs an out-of-sample assessment of the way Slaughter has continued to develop the foresight agenda.

Different identification strategies produce similar results: 1 year of additional age confers an advantage of roughly 03 standard deviations. By contrasting Tlaxcala with a neighboring state that did not change the cutoff concurrently, we decompose the effect of relative age into a positive effect of age at test, and a negative effect of the position in the distribution of age. Older classmates have a positive spillover, whereas younger classmates have a negative spillover. If tested at the exact same age, younger students would outperform their older classmates. We complement the analysis with estimates of relative-age effects in six labor and marriage market outcomes in a sample of Mexican adults. Significant effects are found in the six outcomes. Lastly, we lay out a theoretical model to explain differences in relative-age effects in wages across countries, highlighting the role played by selectivity of the mechanisms used to allocate educational opportunities and the wage premium to those educational opportunities in the labor market.

In other word, this study found that remittances do not contribute to the development of these 23 African countries and suggest that government of each country must apply investment policies that can promote advantage to domestic labor and investors.","[Ay, Ahmet; Baoua, Mahamane Moutari Abdou; Ali, Youssouf Soilihi] Selcuk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Konya, Turkey; [Kursunel, Fahri] Selcuk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business, Konya, Turkey",Selcuk University; Selcuk University,"Ay, A (通讯作者)，Selcuk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Konya, Turkey.",,"Abdou, Mahamane Moutari Abdou/AAS-3420-2020","Abdou, Mahamane Moutari Abdou/0000-0002-8580-4061; KURSUNEL, FAHRI/0000-0002-7278-2254",,,,,33,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,100,112,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700010,0

It argues that there has been a shift in the German growth model from growth pulled by net exports and consumption simultaneously to almost exclusively export-led growth. In addition, exports of machinery and transportation equipment have become more price-sensitive, implying that wage and price increases now pose a greater threat to growth than in the past. These macroeconomic developments have spurred a set of adjustments in the industrial relations sphere with export-oriented firms seeking cost reductions and liberalizations. Industrial relations changes have in turn contributed to entrench export-led growth by augmenting the systemic importance of the foreign sector and reducing the relevance of domestic demand. The export sector has thrived at the expense of real wage stagnation, particularly (but not exclusively) in labour-intensive service sectors, and pattern bargaining has lost its ability to redistribute across sectors and boost domestic demand. The new German model is much leaner and meaner than in the past. Contrary to recent literature, its erosion and liberalization are not limited to the service periphery but affect the manufacturing core as well.","[Baccaro, Lucio] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Benassi, Chiara] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of Geneva; University of London; King's College London,"Baccaro, L (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.",Lucio.Baccaro@unige.ch,,"Baccaro, Lucio/0000-0001-6410-6179",,,,,101,69,71,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Using available case law, the article shows that there is no evidence of Omission Bias among WTO adjudicator's in terms of their rulings, but rather the case law discloses evidentiary and practical problems which may prevent the instigating and enforcing of claims of this nature. Specifically the test for this kind of subsidization is complex and its application is frustrated by the lack of tax expertise among WTO panellists and Appellate Body members as well as the opacity in many countries' revenue and tax incentive regimes. The article concludes by acknowledging the need for greater transparency in domestic revenue laws and the more ready use of expertise in tax relief cases in the WTO dispute settlement system.","[Collins, David] City Univ London, Int Econ Law, London, England; [Park, Tae Jung] Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Park, Tae Jung] Minist Trade Ind & Energy South Korea, Sejong City, South Korea",City University London; University of Virginia,"Collins, D (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Int Econ Law, London, England.",david.collins@utoronto.ca; tp6kd@virginia.edu,,,,,,,34,3,3,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Demand for domestic workers for eldercare is especially high as a result of the rapid aging of the population in these countries. However, domestic eldercare employment is characterized as a low-pay, low-status occupation worldwide. This article examines the relative pay of domestic eldercare workers in urban China and its underlying determinants. The estimates show that when holding observable individual characteristics constant, domestic eldercare workers earn 28 percent less than other types of workers in the service sector in Shanghai. The analysis attributes the low wages of eldercare workers to the fact that domestic paid work is culturally devalued, eldercare is performed by workers from the most marginalized segments of Shanghai's labor force, and the users of eldercare are relatively poor among the users of domestic services.","[Dong, Xiao-Yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Feng, Jin] Fudan Univ, Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yangyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Publ Econ & Adm, 111 Wuchuan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Winnipeg; Fudan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Dong, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca; jfeng@fudan.edu.cn; yu.yangyang@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71273056, 71303150]; Ministry of Education of China [NCET-12-0133, 13YJC790188]; Shanghai Foundation of Philosophy Social Science [2014EJB002]; China Scholarship Council","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Shanghai Foundation of Philosophy Social Science; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","We are grateful to participants in 2013 IAFFE (International Association for Feminist Economics) annual conference and participants in the Workshop of Feminist Economics in China and India in New Delhi for their valuable comments.

A South African negotiator asked the author why the Europeans were obsessed with such names, after all, he said, 'whenever I go to Pizza Hut and I order pizza I always think of pizza as made in Italy'. I replied that this was exactly what Europeans were afraid of. There is a deep 'cultural' and legal divide between the EU and the US on the issue of geographical indications, its cultural underpinnings and trade interests. This article examines how this debate is becoming more complex and deep rooted with developing country markets, some increasingly using Geographical Indications (GIs) to promote their own products, being the object of the contest.
