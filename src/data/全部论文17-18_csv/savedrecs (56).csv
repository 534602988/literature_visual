Globalization is a crucial process that forms world economy. Within it, as already mentioned A. Smith, trade represents the cornerstone of international economic relations. In the individual states, the trade role always depends on their economic level and integration into the world economy, which also determinate the character of the trade policy in different periods. The USA can be an illustrative example of that policy formation as well as of the change of its character under globalization. During the U.S. economy initial phase, for specific reasons (infant industry) its external protection was rather strong. Later in 19th century, the paradigm of independent economic development was formed, optimised under significant custom protection. The approach was mostly kept until 1930s and justified by the U.S. large internal market, relative self-sufficiency, non-developed globalization or world economic crises prevention. After World War II the USA were hit by a huge globalization drive, and their economy gradually opened. Undoubtedly the USA benefited from their position strengthening during the War as well as from globalization development. However recently, President Trump has started to criticise globalization and the U.S. trade liberalization using the protective ideas of the fathers-founders (thought applied under different conditions) as his new economic policy argument. In contrast, economic theory and practical experience show the advantage of the free trade for the USA even in the top globalization phase.","[Neumann, Pavel] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Neumann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",neumann@vse.cz,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,269,275,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300036,0

Human behavior also leads to climate change, which has been repeatedly and independently confirmed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Design/methodology/approach: Any here discussed objectives are only a small extract of all existing or potential objectives. The research method used by the author was an analysis of existing and published literature within Web of Science and elsewhere like the IPCC and its organisations (in total more than 15 references), mainly from the last decade. Findings: Research findings are shown within a brief summary to offer an opportunity for further analysis, discussions, or results. The climate change is an accepted possibility to measure effects on nature, based on numerical indicators and values. The emergence of external costs must be borne in full by the insurers and thus the insured persons. Research/practical implications: Results and implications for practice, applications and consequences are identified. Climate change and its effects can be evaluated in the short, mid and long-term run. The insured persons bear all costs incurred through the risk calculation of the insurer. Originality/value: This paper sees climate change from the economics point of view (a research gap so far) and is in contrast to most existing literature, which has the approach from the environment (natural sciences/technique) or society/politics.","[Novak, David] Engerode 56, D-30880 Laatzen, Germany",,"Novak, D (通讯作者)，Engerode 56, D-30880 Laatzen, Germany.",david.novak1@t-online.de,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2696,2703,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300345,0

Dominant factors determining such an approach are knowledge, information and the increase of intellectual potential. The root cause of changes taking place in the labour market are mostly globalisation processes and the advancement of modern technology. Due to the variety of IT solutions improving communication, the significance of geographic boundaries and the actual location where the work is conducted is decreasing. As a result the labour market is opening up to flexible forms of employment, one of them being telecommuting. Global market forces, growing competition and the urge to cut the costs on the one hand, cause increased flexibility. On the other hand, it enables adjustment to the requirements of the labour market. Growing demand for labour force skilled in a very narrow speciality leads to global disproportions. Telecommuting is also beneficial for employees. As work-life balance and other personal factors have become more valued, telecommuting appears to be a solution. The aim of this article is to provide evidence that the new form of employment, which does not require physical presence in the office, is the consequence of globalisation. Furthermore, the paper outlines factors essential to the development of telecommuting and presents an analysis of benefits, drawbacks and challenges deriving from such a form of employment. The article was developed mostly on literature review and on the basis of demographic and statistical data acquired from Eurostat and particular economic institutions.","[Sroka, Alicja; Balcerowicz-Szkutnik, Maria] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Balcerowicz-Szkutnik, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",alasroka@hotmail.com; maria.balcerowicz-szkutnik@ue.katowice.pl,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2361,2368,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300302,0

This system comprises two different kinds of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an evolutionary algorithm, and has as main goal sorting tasks incoming into CC according to their security demands. Trust levels of virtual machines (VMs) in the environment are automatically set to meet the tasks security demands. Tasks are then scheduled on VMs optimizing the makespan and ensuring that their security requirements are fulfilled. The paper also describes tests assessing the best configurations for the system components, using randomly generated batches of tasks. Results are presented and discussed.

Regardless of the company field of activity, industry, trade, construction, services, etc., there is a need to improve the efficiency of business processes through engineering or reengineering. Of all business processes, the most manageable ones are the functional processes at the subdivision level, as well as the processes at the lower level of decomposition; those that are performed by one person at the workplace. Research data shows that when dealing with unstructured processes, initially people organize themselves. Further, in the course of systematic self-organization, the risk of a complete loss of controllability of the organization increases, which makes it impossible to achieve the desired goals within a single structural unit or the whole company. This activity is traditionally accompanied by a surplus of resources (highly paid managers and specialists), which affects the cost of solving the problem, and the issue of information support of interfunctional processes becomes an especially pressing one. The rapid development of information technology in recent decades has resulted in need to manage consciously the process of developing a software product. In this regard, the issue of choosing the means, methods and approaches to software development is relevant as never before.","[Volkoya, Albina A.; Nikitin, Yury A.] Acad Mat & Tech Provis, St Petersburg, Russia; [Plotnikov, Vladimir A.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Volkoya, AA (通讯作者)，Acad Mat & Tech Provis, St Petersburg, Russia.",albvolkova@yandex.ru; plotnikov_2000@mail.ru; yunikiti@yandex.ru,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2392,2398,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300306,0

The main digital technologies that are generating the risks of cyberattacks are considered, including: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, augmented reality, unmanned devices, virtual reality, blockchains and robotization. It has been shown that the increasing dependence on the Big Data and internet work is putting the business activities of transport companies at risk of losing their resistance to cyber-shocks. Cyber-threats are described as large-scale events with destructive consequences for the transportation business, which develops according to the cascade principle. In the paper, the classification of cyber-threats is given, and the predicted consequences of cyberattacks on automation and robotics systems are presented. The inequality in the matters of readiness and the provision of cyber security between the transport companies in different countries of the world is established, while the main factors for this are considered. They include the economic, ecological, public or cybernetic stability of states towards cyber-attacks, and in particular, their investments in an infrastructure, knowledge and relationships that are resistant to cyber-shocks. It is proved that cyber- resistance should be considered as an integral method of providing benefits to the transport company, and not just as a way to prevent risks. The benefits of investments in the digital transformation of transport services, as well as the key directions for cost reductions in the formation of a new business model based on digital products, are described.","[Zhuravleva, Natialia] Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, St Petersburg 190031, Russia; [Shayshukov, Viacheslav] St Petersburg Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Shayshukov, V (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Univ, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",zhuravleva_na@mail.ru; v.shavshukov@spbu.ru,"Zhuravleva, Natalia/B-3231-2019","Zhuravleva, Natalia/0000-0003-3566-9225",,,,,23,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2429,2436,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300311,0

We conclude that the perceived upper bound of the inflation target is significantly higher than the announced one in many countries. Additionally, the perceived target band is narrower and asymmetric around the mid-point of the target for most CBs. We examine the implications of these findings and find that IT CBs are more likely to miss their targets when the perceptions of the financial markets are higher than the announced IT targets.

This study sheds light on the combined use of FITs and capital subsidies. The purpose of the study is to clarify their optimal combinations in order to encourage households to adopt photovoltaic (PV) systems. The study develops a microeconomic model embodying the idea of two-part tariffs. The most important findings concern the combination that maximizes social welfare: if FITs are applied to the total PV electricity generated, they should be set at the avoided cost per unit of PV electricity, and capital subsidies should be used to control the number of adopters; whereas, if FITs are applied to only surplus PV electricity, the previous principle is distorted. However, a numerical example suggests that the distortion has little effect on the maximized social welfare and, thus, it makes little difference whether FITs are applied to all PV electricity or just the surplus PV electricity. The findings may also be applied to the adoption of wind-power generation systems and to adoption by businesses.","[Yamamoto, Yoshihiro] Takasaki City Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Gunma 3700801, Japan",,"Yamamoto, Y (通讯作者)，Takasaki City Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Gunma 3700801, Japan.",ysyama@tcue.ac.jp,"Yamamoto, Yoshihiro/JRW-5105-2023",,JSPS KAKENHI [JP24560500],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number JP24560500].,,22,21,21,1,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,312,320,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.041,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700032,0

We build an overlapping generations model with age-dependent mortality rates. We numerically assess environmental and non-environmental welfare effects that existing and future generations experience over a lifetime. First, when the reform involves the dirty goods tax, we find that individuals older than 65 years old and future generations do not experience a double dividend. When the reform involves the pollution emissions tax, we find individuals older than 25 years old and future generations do not experience a double dividend. Second, contrary to the reform relying on the dirty goods tax, the reform relying on the pollution emissions tax has larger negative non-environmental welfare effects and larger positive environmental welfare effects for future generations. Third, we compare our results to those of the perpetual youth model. We show that the two models yield a different qualitative and quantitative assessment of the double dividend. Furthermore, the perpetual youth model tends to overstate the potential of the reforms for Pareto improvements and understate their adverse effects on net intergenerational distribution. Thus, our analysis suggests that those tax reforms alone cannot help achieve sustainable development as they redistribute welfare unequally across generations. Modeling a realistic demographic process is key in assessing intergenerational welfare distribution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Energy futures & land use in India,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Land use; India; Energy futures,ELECTRICITY-GENERATION,"Modelling studies which project pathways for the future of energy in India currently have several implicit assumptions with regards to the social, institutional, and political changes necessary for energy transitions. This paper focuses on the specific question of land use change required for realising ambitious clean energy targets. Demand for land is likely to be a critical question in India's energy future given the challenges with land acquisition in the country as a result of high population density and significant rights enjoyed by landowners. Yet, there is a lack of literature relevant to India which makes a quantitative assessment of the land use impacts of different types of low carbon technologies. I calculate and compare the land requirements in India of ground based solar photovoltaic (PV) power, nuclear power, and wind energy. All three types of technologies are expected to grow substantially as a share of India's electricity mix in the coming years. The analysis suggests that land demands of ground based solar PV are likely to be substantial compared to wind energy and nuclear power, and some policy suggestions are provided which may help mitigate that challenge.","[Mohan, Aniruddh] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany; [Mohan, Aniruddh] Tandem Res, 78 Carrem Socorro, Bardez 403521, Goa, India",,"Mohan, A (通讯作者)，Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany.",aniruddhmo@wupperinst.org,"Mohan, Aniruddh/G-5496-2018","Mohan, Aniruddh/0000-0002-6797-6329",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),This research was made possible through funding from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.,,41,18,19,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,257,262,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.025,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800025,0

Using an analysis of the institutions together with a model of the cost pass-through regulatory process, I show that households as a group would not benefit from purchasing the gas commodity from unregulated commodity marketers rather than buying it bundled with delivery from the regulated utility. I next use monthly price data collected from the public web pages of these unregulated sellers to confirm the theoretical prediction. Depending on the time period, five-year natural gas contract commodity prices average more than 75% higher than the utility's regulated cost of gas. On average over the sample period, signing up meant paying over C$400 more for the gas commodity annually. The analysis suggests that claims about the effects of policy change should be informed by a careful assessment of the specific institutional arrangements and the new incentives created by institutional evolution.","[Bloemhof, Barb] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada",McMaster University,"Bloemhof, B (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",bloemhbl@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,555,564,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.038,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400054,0

Meanwhile, the provision of heavy subsidies has motivated the discussion of social and economic benefits of this technology, mainly on the impacts on employment. Although there is abundant literature on this issue in developed countries, studies on developing countries, especially of China are rare. In this study, a spreadsheet-based analytical model is established for the estimation of employment effects of China's solar PV industry during the period of 2009-2015. Building on this model and using four indices and detailed data of sample companies, it is found that during the period of 2009-2015, whilst the number of jobs created by China's solar PV industry increased, the jobs/MW ratios and employment skewness of China's solar PV industry declined. The main policy implications are that the government should fully recognize the solar IT industry's role in China's employment, improve the implementation of existing solar PV policies, provide more financial support to solar PV projects, particularly to distributed solar PV projects, and enhance the education and training of solar PV professionals.","[Zhang, Sufang; Chen, Yang; Liu, Xiaoli; Yang, Mengshi; Xu, Liang] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sufang] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Zhang, Sufang] Res Base Beijing Energy Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; University of Sussex,"Zhang, SF (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",zsf69826313@sina.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [14BJY063]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [14JDJGB016]; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities [GB2015011, GB2016MS69]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Beijing Social Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities,"The research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No.14BJY063), the Beijing Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 14JDJGB016), the 2015 Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (Grant No. GB2015011) and the 2016 Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (Grant No. GB2016MS69).",,39,17,18,1,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,59,65,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.058,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400006,0

The analysis uses the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach as a framework for bringing together information regarding the demographic change, allocation of working hours, as well as mapping energy flows metabolized through the different compartments of the socio-economic system. Results indicate that the implementation of the energy plan in Catalonia would result in an increase in the overall energy metabolic rate by 2020, meaning 10% more energy is to be consumed per hour available in society. We conclude that this increase is linked to the need for greater primary energy sources for a transition to renewable energy sources, as well as the need for increasing skilled jobs to perform these tasks in the energy sector. For the case of Catalonia, we conclude that this would correlate to a requirement between 8000 and 23,000 new jobs that will imply a shifting in current metabolic patterns should such a transition take place.","[Rodriguez-Huerta, Edgar; Rosas-Casals, Marti] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, ESEIAAT, Sustainabil Measurement & Modeling Lab SUMMLab, Campus Terrassa, Barcelona 08222, Spain; [Rosas-Casals, Marti] Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, Inst Sustainabil Sci & Technol IS UPC, Campus Diagonal Nord, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sorman, Alevgul H.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Rodríguez-Huerta, E (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, BarcelonaTech, ESEIAAT, Sustainabil Measurement & Modeling Lab SUMMLab, Campus Terrassa, Barcelona 08222, Spain.",edgar.rodriguez@estudiant.upc.edu,"Rodriguez-Huerta, Edgar/AAB-3981-2019; Rosas-Casals, Marti/ABB-1261-2020; Rosas-Casals, Marti/M-2389-2014","Rosas-Casals, Marti/0000-0002-5243-2601; Rosas-Casals, Marti/0000-0002-5243-2601; Rodriguez-Huerta, Edgar/0000-0002-6887-0040",CONACYT-Mexico [220474],CONACYT-Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),One author (ERH) would like to acknowledge a CONACYT-Mexico grant [Ph.D. grant number 220474].

The study surveys the economics of a typical 600 MW newly-built pure condensing coal-fired power plant in six case provinces (Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Hebei, Jiangsu and Guangdong), where the profitability margins of coal power are above national average by the end of 2015. Results indicate that the continuous falling in coal prices have lowered the generation costs but there has been insufficient adjustment to the benchmark on-grid tariff, enabling coal power to obtain unprecedented excess profits. Such excess profits have spurred the investment and caused local government to over-rely on coal power under economic downturn. However, in the context of cost escalation by deteriorated operation efficiency, higher environmental and climate change compliance costs and fierce market competition, the profitability of coal power will dissipate soon. Integrated power capacity plan consistent with the new economic normal, stringent control on the scale of new coal power projects and deep power market reform are the key policy implications of our analysis.","[Yuan, Jiahai; Wang, Yang; Zhang, Weirong; Zhao, Changhong] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jiahai] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab New Energy & Low Carbon Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qian; Shen, Xinyi; Zhang, Kai; Dong, Liansai] Greenpeace East Asia, Beijing 100007, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University,"Yuan, JH (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",yuanjh126@126.com; liu.qian@greenpeace.org,"Zhang, Weirong/JQI-4414-2023; Yuan, Jiahai/I-9186-2019","Yuan, Jiahai/0000-0002-1150-7750",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673085]; Greenpeace,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Greenpeace,The authors acknowledge the funding of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71673085).

As regulations regarding emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants will become stricter with the turn of the decade, change is imminent. Available offshore gas reserves and the possibility of natural gas imports have shown that the substitution of oil with gas can reasonably be expected in the not-so-distant future. However, the framework under which change could occur has not yet been established. Should imports of gas serve as a short-term bridge until domestic gas becomes available? What are the infrastructure implications associated with such a medium-term solution? How does a policy-driven transition to gas affect energy security and how compatible is this with a liberalized electricity market? Can short- and longer term strategies be consistently designed and implemented? A cost-optimization model (OSeMOSYS), representing the electricity system of the island, is used to provide insights to these questions. Results regarding generation mix, capacity and system costs are presented for a set of scenarios.

The intent of the paper is to discuss the continued importance of analytical methods to further knowledge and understanding, and in doing so contribute to enhanced analysis, planning, policy and decision making in a variety of contexts. Regional science is founded on the principle of being a multi-disciplinary effort, bringing together a range of quantitative approaches to study societal issues and concerns through planning and policy efforts, hopefully to bring about positive change. Analytics is an increasingly popular reference to the methods employed by a discipline or specialty area. Given the prominence of methods in regional science, it is suggestive of a more nuanced term like regional analytics. It is hoped that reflecting on regional analytics will reinforce the significance and strength of our discipline in the coming years and decades. It is only through our actions that we will make a difference, and we hope that such actions are based on the best information and scientific reasoning possible.","[Murray, Alan T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Murray, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",amurray@ucsb.edu,"Murray, Alan T/B-2993-2012","Murray, Alan T/0000-0003-2674-6110",,,,,16,8,8,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The traditional source of maritime energy, offshore petroleum and gas, has been on the rise since a reliable method of extraction was discovered in the mid-20th century. Lately, it has been joined by offshore wind and tidal power as alternative green sources of maritime energy. Yet all of this has implications for maritime environmental regimes as well, as maritime energy extraction/generation can have a negative effect on the ocean environment. This paper considers two major questions surrounding maritime energy and environmental concerns. First, how and why do these two concerns, maritime energy and environmental protection, play against each other? Second, how can states both secure their energy and environmental securities in the maritime domain? Maximizing maritime energy output necessitates some environmental costs and vice versa, but these costs vary with the type of offshore energy technology used and with the extent to which states are willing to expend effort to protect both environmental and energy security.","[Nyman, Elizabeth] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Liberal Studies, POB 1675, Galveston, TX 77553 USA",Texas A&M University System,"Nyman, E (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Liberal Studies, POB 1675, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",enyman@tamug.edu,,"Nyman, Elizabeth/0000-0001-6622-5710",,,,,21,3,4,5,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,310,314,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.004,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600031,0

In this light, developing effective policy and communication measures necessitates understanding how people perceive energy systems. Accordingly, the present study aimed to shed light on people's imagery of solar power, one of the renewable energy sources with the highest potential. Results revealed that almost unanimously people associate solar power with highly positive imagery and that visual characteristics are especially prevalent. The successful realization of renewable energy projects requires policymakers to draw on reliable data about public acceptance of renewables. In response to this need, the present study examined whether assessing public acceptance of renewables on a more concrete level (i.e., by addressing drawbacks) can result in a different, more reliable acceptance rating than assessment on an abstract level, as done at present in opinion polls. Results showed that people do not think about drawbacks related to renewables when they consider it from a general, more abstract, perspective. However, when downsides are specifically addressed, people integrate these into their evaluation, thus diminishing acceptance. Even the highly positive imagery of solar power is relativized and acceptance decreases. These findings have several important implications for policymakers.","[Sutterlin, Bernadette; Siegrist, Michael] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Consumer Behav, IED, Univ Str 22,CHN J 75-3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Sütterlin, B (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Consumer Behav, IED, Univ Str 22,CHN J 75-3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",bsuetterlin@ethz.ch,"Siegrist, Michael/A-1032-2008; Suetterlin, Bernadette/S-3265-2016","Suetterlin, Bernadette/0000-0001-9749-6660",Swissnuclear [FGK-12.068.GS],Swissnuclear,"The survey reported in this paper was funded by Swissnuclear (Grant no.

The rapid development of the automobile sector has increased energy consumption. According to the results of this paper, automobile energy consumption accounted for about 10.73% of total energy consumption in China in 2015, about 3.6 times the proportion a decade ago. With the deterioration of urban traffic conditions, relying on expanding the amount of vehicles and city road network cannot solve the problem. Urban rail transit is energy-saving and less-polluting, uses less space, has large capacity, and secure. Urban rail transit, according to the principle of sustainable development, is a green transportation system and should be especially adopted for large and medium-sized cities. The paper uses the binary choice model (Probit and Logit) to analyze the main factors influencing the development of rail transit in Chinese cities, and whether automobile energy consumption is the reason for the construction of urban rail transit. Secondly, we analyze the influence of urban rail transit on automobile energy consumption using DID model. The results indicate that the construction of urban rail traffic can restrain automobile energy consumption significantly, with continuous impact in the second-year.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Fujian 361005, Peoples R China; [Du, Zhili] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Fujian 361005, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn; duzhili620@126.com,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Du, Zhili/0000-0001-5152-737X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No:1260-Y07200), and Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund.",,29,48,51,10,66,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,120,127,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.038,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900012,0

This paper aims to examine energy efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions abatement costs of city urban areas in China. To this end, an improved slacks-based measure approach is introduced, which considers the linkage between desirable and undesirable outputs. Then, measures of energy efficiency, CO2 emission abatement cost and comprehensive state index of CO2 emissions abatement cost and CO2 emissions reduction potential are defined. The proposed model is then applied to the dataset of 285 cities in China during 2008-2012. The results show that most city urban areas in China have relatively low energy efficiencies. Surprisingly, there are gradually narrowing gaps regarding mean energy efficiencies between areas during 2008-2012. Nevertheless, there are great disparities in energy efficiencies between cities within a typical area, and even a provincial region. It is found that CO2 emissions abatement cost in urban China exhibits an increasing trend during the study period. Also, significantly geographic disparities in abatement costs between areas, regions and cites are found. Specifically, energy efficiency has significantly positive correlation with the comprehensive state index in China.

Adherence to the law is associated with environmental gains, but also with losses in surpluses as firms incur abatement costs. By relating the net social benefit of deterring breaches of legislation to inspection costs, the impact of various market characteristics on the effectiveness of inspections can be assessed, thus providing guidance for environmental inspection agencies that have to prioritize among sectors given a fixed budget.

It has producer, electricity and transport fuel subsidies. It is at an interesting juncture in subsidy reform: the government faces the embeddedness of distributive justice norms that are contested by fiscal prudence and environmental stewardship norms. The value of the paper is twofold. First it develops a subsidy intractability framework to explain reform global narratives that highlights: the power of agents, the nature of contested economic, justice and environmental norms and the availability of mechanisms for reform. Second, this framework is used to explain reform narratives and trajectories in Trinidad and Tobago using data from public documents and from a unique elite survey of former and present heads of state, politicians, policy makers and stakeholders. Even in conditions of falling oil prices and national revenue and pressures to reduce emissions, where redistributive justice arguments are heavily embedded in public discourses, those aspects of the subsidy that have developmental or distributive justice goals are more intractable. The results of the study have implications for carbon emission reduction strategies in developing states with fossil fuel reserves.","[Scobie, Michelle] Univ West Indies, Int Law, Global Environm Governance, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Scobie, Michelle] Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Saint Augustine,"Scobie, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies, Int Law, Global Environm Governance, Inst Int Relat, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.;Scobie, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",michelle.scobie@sta.uwi.edu,,"Scobie, Michelle/0000-0002-8928-047X",,,,,47,16,16,0,42,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,265,273,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.008,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500026,0

Starting from the consideration that there are spillover effects between similar regions, first we identify the factors that capture these similarities, then we use them to evaluate their relevance in determining the success of the investments in RES. An econometric analysis, based on the use of spatial panel specification model, is implemented to support the hypotheses. Two important results emerge from the study. The first is the identification of regional determinants of RES production, that are driven by the similarities between regions, and that can be interpreted as guidelines in the policy choices in support of investments. The second is the lack of effectiveness of the incentives in support of RES. Results indicate that the capacity of some regional governments to direct the funds allocated by the central government or European Commission towards efficient production of renewable energy is likely limited, and these incentives have been undone.","[Carfora, Alfonso; Romano, Antonio A.; Ronghi, Monica; Scandurra, Giuseppe] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management Studies & Quantitat Methods, Via Generale Parisi,13, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Carfora, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management Studies & Quantitat Methods, Via Generale Parisi,13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",alfonso.carfora@uniparthenope.it; antonio.romano@uniparthenope.it; monica.ronghi@uniparthenope.it; giuseppe.scandurra@uniparthenope.it,,"Carfora, Alfonso/0000-0002-5805-8198",European Structural & Investment Funds; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),European Structural & Investment Funds; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"The ROP are co-financed by the European Structural & Investment Funds, which are instruments of European cohesion policy.

A year later, the methodology for the calculation of the Voluntary Price for the Small Consumer (VPSC) was approved: a real-time price tariff for small domestic consumers. Under this price-setting system, VPSC consumers are billed according to their hourly consumption and hourly prices along the day. Directive 27/2014/EU, on energy saving, was also transposed to Spanish regulation in 2014. The impact on the Spanish electricity market and domestic VPSC consumers of these two recent energy policy modifications are analyzed in this work. A qualitative model, based on the flexibility of the merit-order curves, is first introduced to formulate a number of hypotheses. A set of scenarios are then examined to quantify the main effects on the market and on domestic consumers. The results show that domestic energy-saving, and, to a lesser extent, load-shifting scenarios, can diminish the mean hourly price and the cost of the annual traded energy in the market. Nevertheless, these reductions are mainly granted to large qualified consumers, since domestic consumers mostly benefit from the reduction of their energy demand rather than from a reduction of the price.","[Roldan Fernandez, Juan Manuel; Burgos Payan, Manuel; Riquelme Santos, Jesus Manuel; Trigo-Garcia, Angel Luis] Univ Seville, Dept Ingn Elect, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Payán, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Ingn Elect, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",jmroldan@us.es; mburgos@us.es; jsantos@us.es; trigoal@us.es,"Garcia, Angel Luis Trigo/L-6428-2014; Riquelme, Jesus/L-6720-2014; ROLDAN FERNANDEZ, JUAN MANUEL/L-8160-2014","Riquelme, Jesus/0000-0001-6280-6796; ROLDAN FERNANDEZ, JUAN MANUEL/0000-0002-3811-1078","Spanish MEC - Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness); European Commission (ERDF - European Regional Development Fund) [ENE2014-54115-R, PCIN-2015-043, ENE2015-69597-R, ENE2016-77650-R]",Spanish MEC - Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness); European Commission (ERDF - European Regional Development Fund),"This work was partially supported by the Spanish MEC - Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness) and co-funded by the European Commission (ERDF - European Regional Development Fund) under grants ENE2014-54115-R, PCIN-2015-043, ENE2015-69597-R and ENE2016-77650-R.",,35,18,18,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,41,51,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.040,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200006,0

Two factors are crucial to this sudden transformation: 1) massive central and local government subsidies, and 2) huge non-monetary incentives via exemptions from restrictions on vehicle ownership in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhere. Innovative business models and greatly expanded vehicle offerings, especially by local Chinese manufacturers, also helped accelerate PEV sales and infrastructure deployment. However, continued sales growth is threatened by persistent regional protectionism, the unsustainability of these large subsidies, and widely reported cheating by some automakers. We suggest some innovative policies that China might pioneer and transfer elsewhere.","[Wang, Yunshi; Sperling, Daniel; Tal, Gil] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Fang, Haifeng] China Automot Technol & Res Ctr, New Energy Vehicle & Fiscal Policy Res Grp, Tianjin, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Wang, YS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",yunwang@ucdavis.edu,"Tal, Gil/A-7392-2012","Tal, Gil/0000-0001-7843-3664",Energy Foundation China; ClimateWorks; Shanghai Pujiang Program [14PJC058],Energy Foundation China; ClimateWorks; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"We thank Energy Foundation China and ClimateWorks for their continued support of our research on PEVs in China, as well as the consortium members of the China-U.S. Zero Emissions Vehicle Policy Lab and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center.

However, they involve diverse risks for the auctioneer and the bidders. The major risk for the auctioneer with respect to the expansion target and the acceptance of auctions for RES in general is the risk of non-realization: awarded bidders do not realize their projects. The main reasons are bidders' uncertainties concerning their project costs. The auctioneer can reduce the non-realization risk by taking various measures. The most discussed and implemented measures are financial and physical prequalifications and penalties. An evaluation of these measures has relevant implications for an appropriate auctions design for RES. The non-realization option induces lower bids. A suitable combination of financial and physical prequalifications can reduce the non-realization risk significantly, however, involves sunk costs. Counterintuitively, first-price auction and second-price auction lead to different expected award prices and different realization probabilities. Penalties bear a high risk of inefficient auction outcomes. The appropriate parametrization and combination of the measures is challenging. Under consideration of all implications, we recommend high financial and adjusted physical prequalifications to achieve a sufficiently high realization rate while maintaining efficiency.","[Kreiss, Jan; Ehrhart, Karl-Martin] KIT, Inst Econ, Neuer Zirkel 3, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Kreiss, Jan; Ehrhart, Karl-Martin; Haufe, Marie-Christin] TAKON GmbH, Schwalbenweg 5, D-95445 Bayreuth, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Kreiss, J (通讯作者)，KIT, Inst Econ, Neuer Zirkel 3, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",kreiss@takon.com; ehrhart@takon.com; haufe@takon.com,,"Ehrhart, Karl-Martin/0000-0002-8846-5835",EU Horizon program [646172],EU Horizon program,"This work was supported by the EU Horizon 2020 program, grant number 646172 (AURES).

The growth of the textile industry accentuated the characteristics that the industrial location had assumed in Argentina; especially the spatial concentration in the City of Buenos Aires and its outskirts. It is shown that Argentine textile development partially fits the industrial district model. Although industrial concentration in Buenos Aires allowed the textile industry to benefit from Marshallian external economies, this industrial growth assumed typical forms of the late, late industrialization characterized by Albert Hirschman.

The transition from economic activity to senior status usually results in an income reduction and, consequently, seniors reduce their consumption. In future years the ratio of the economically active population and dependent population will change considerably. In 2050 the old-age dependency ratio in the Czech Republic is expected to reach 52%. These developments will impact the Czech economy at several levels. The reduced consumption of seniors will lead to: a reduction in aggregate household consumption a subsequent GDP growth decline or even contraction, and lower tax revenues leading to a reduction in government spending, a spiral domino effect.","[Beran, Vlastimil; Godarova, Jana] Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs RILSA, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic",,"Beran, V (通讯作者)，Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs RILSA, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic.",vlastimil.beran@vupsv.cz; jana.godarova@vupsv.cz,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,UNIV SOCIAL & ADM AFFAIRS,HAVIROV,"VITEZSLAVA NEZVALA 801-1, HAVIROV, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87291-20-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,47,60,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Public Administration,BP4JR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000552892500005,0

Stock prices are likely to be among the prices that are relatively vulnerable to purely social movements because there is no accepted theory by which to understand the worth of stocks and no clearly predictable consequences to changing one's investments. Ordinary investors have no model or at best a very incomplete model of the behaviour of prices, dividends, or earnings of speculative assets. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the influence of behavioural effects of market participants on the stock price returns, volatility and trading volumes. Methodologically we have used various economic indicators that measure the degree of optimism that consumers feel and how the level of consumer confidence affects stock prices. The results of used regression model shows evidence of flagrant decision errors under social pressure but not of abandonment of rational individual judgment, and confirmed the reaction of chosen macroeconomic variables on the stock index movement. The Behavioural Finance has identified contagion as one of the underlying mechanisms of booms and panics in financial markets, where contagious entities such as rumours, profit expectations, trading rules and others are transmitted via social interactions. The paper highlights social media data consequence and their impact on stock prices movements and forecasts, as well as evidence supporting the hypothesis of emotions playing a more important role during stressed markets compared to calm periods.","[Bikar, Milos; Vavrova, Katarina] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Bikár, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",milos.bikar@gmail.com; katarina.vavrov10@gmail.com,,,VEGA [1/0007/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The presented working paper is the output of the scientific grants VEGA n. 1/0007/16 The impact of the global economic developments and trends in the direction of the euro area economy on financial management of business entities in Slovakia.,,18,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,155,162,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200021,0

Regarding this last phase, this paper focuses on company management of labour, related to its production strategies in specific geological conditions and socioeconomic context. In interaction with this, analysis also looks at workers answers and emphasizes about the dynamic of reciprocal adaptations which is revealed by the evolution of working conditions, its changes and continuities.

Regional Studies. There is a paradox in the scholarly contributions to the social polarization debate. Studies that rely on occupational descriptions to measure employment change produce results that take the form of a professionalizing pattern of growth. By contrast, studies that rank occupations by income to measure employment change produce evidence in support of social polarization. This study applies both methods to measure employment change in greater Johannesburg (South Africa) from 1996 to 2012 in order to demonstrate why these different methods produce such different results. The results have important implications for how statistical evidence is used to test the social polarization hypothesis.","[Crankshaw, Owen] Univ Cape Town, Dept Sociol, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Crankshaw, O (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Sociol, Cape Town, South Africa.",Owen.Crankshaw@uct.ac.za,"Crankshaw, Owen/D-1325-2015","Crankshaw, Owen/0000-0002-9006-5005",National Research Foundation [85462]; University of Cape Town,National Research Foundation; University of Cape Town,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation [grant number 85462]; and by the University of Cape Town [under the Block Grant].,,28,7,8,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Unfortunately, in India about 50% of the eligible children aged 12-23 months miss some essential vaccination. Though a positive association between maternal education and markers of child health like immunization has been long established, the literature has struggled to find a causal relationship, mainly because education is inextricably correlated with other socioeconomic variables like income. In this chapter, I propose a new instrument for women's education in India using the following facts. First, due to lack of sanitary facilities in schools, particularly rural schools, large number of girls drop out of school once they reach puberty. Second, age at menarche is largely determined by biological factors and not social factors. Together, age at menarche can explain variations in schooling, yet be independent of outcome variables like child immunization. I find that additional years of maternal schooling (conditional on strictly positive years of schooling) do increase the probability of complete immunization of children.","[De, Prabal K.] CUNY City Coll, Colin Powell Sch, Dept Econ & Business, New York, NY 10031 USA; [De, Prabal K.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"De, PK (通讯作者)，CUNY City Coll, Colin Powell Sch, Dept Econ & Business, New York, NY 10031 USA.;De, PK (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10021 USA.",,"De, Prabal/JTV-6243-2023",,,,,,43,1,2,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-2199,,978-1-78635-465-5; 978-1-78635-466-2,ADV HEALTH ECON HEAL,,,2017,25.0,,,,,,85,107,,10.1108/S0731-219920170000025003,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Health Policy & Services; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ2HJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419350900004,0

Municipal governments are facing the issue of balancing the relationship between economic growth and environmental preservation. An urban system is an open, complex, dynamic ecological-economic system with different types of materials and resources. This paper combines emergy theory and System Dynamics (SD) and establishes an emergy-flow SD model of an urban eco-economic system that includes economic, population, waste and emergy sub-models. Three scenarios with different economic growth rates and investments in environmental preservation are designed to analyze the sustainable development capacity of Beijing under different scenarios. The results of the analysis show that current economic development in Beijing highly depends on resources consumption, especially the consumption of imported resources. Based on the current growth rate, development in Beijing will heavily depend on external resources that may make the system being more fragile in the future. A lower economic growth rate and a small increase in environmental preservation investment are more suitable for in Beijing than area higher economic growth rate and a large increase in environmental preservation investment.

Municipal Services' spatial connection diagrams have been made based on the regional strength of the interaction, and with comparison a significant coupling relationship has been proved among potential development capacity, acceleration and spatial links, and the tightness of spatial connection of regional service industry does play a significant role in promoting the space-time evolution of Services' spatial structure, which means with Services' spatial links turning gradually closer, the spatial structure of Services displays more complexity, transforming from original single-core structure to multi-core structure, and lastly being stable at complex network structure, regional services integration framework begins to emerge. Moreover, according to data of spatial links of Services, agglomeration level and level of economic openness from the four time section, a corresponding spatial distribution figure has been drawn by R-language to explore their relationship in spatial fitting. It shows that they are perfectly fitting in spatial distribution, and all of them concentrate their distribution in the Pearl River Delta region, which indicates that economic openness is the one significant driving factor enhancing the spatial links of Services and agglomeration level, and agglomeration level improving and lingks going closer always make contributions to an accelerated trans-regional and cross-border circulation of population, information, capital and other resources, which indirectly enhance regional economic openness. In recent years, with the global economic service, the academic community on the spatial distribution of the service industry has gradually increased [1], a large number of theoretical and empirical research focused on the proliferation of productive services industry space [2,3], spatial heterogeneity distribution [4], Industrial spatial structure and evolution analysis [5,6] and other directions, the results are quite abundant. With the country into the new economic normal, eight vertical and eight horizontal space planning makes the economic space is becoming increasingly close, the previous attention to the economic spatial distribution of academic research will gradually shift to economic space, economic network structure. In addition, Guangdong Province, as the pioneer province of China's economic opening up, the development of its regional service industry and the spatial connection must have a significant relationship with the degree of economic openness. In the past, there are few researches on the spatial and spatial Economic openness of the spatial distribution of the relationship between the empirical studies to explore the intrinsic relationship between the two. To sum up, this study will first analyze the spatial connection of service space and the spatial network structure from the perspective of spatial interaction. On this basis, further analysis of the service industry spatial contact, network structure and economic openness of the spatial fitting match to examine the internal relationship between service industry and economic openness.","[Huang Dawei] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Huang Dawei] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Shenzhen Polytechnic University; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Huang, DW (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Huang, DW (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",daweihuang@163.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-452-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,179.0,,,,,,473,482,,,,,,10,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854700100,0

The Czech Republic is not a typical touring country, but its benefits from tourism are considerable and the importance of tourism in other countries is even increased with higher tourist popularity.","[Hyblova, Monika] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Hyblová, M (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",mhyblova@fame.utb.cz,"Hyblova, Monika/B-1997-2018","Hyblova, Monika/0000-0002-7788-6204",,,,,30,0,0,0,4,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-654-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,164,175,,10.7441/dokbat.2017.17,0.0,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6FF,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466528800017,0

Surprisingly, the reason of this situation is fragmentation - not only of managerial practice but also of theoretical approaches. Nowadays, fragmentation is perceived as consequence of accelerating globalisation. By adaptation to the specifics of national sociocultural profiles, managers try to build strong and valuable global brands with increasing equity consisting in unique identity while theorists elaborate partial theories of global brand equity without linking to previously created schools of Keller or Aaker. This situation causes a spiral effect where managers doesn't reach set objectives by applying contemporary theoretical approaches what invokes the need of theoretical solution to numerous partial problems of brand value building and managing patterns failure. So, the theory is fragmenting under pressure of demand of practice and subsequently, the practice applies inconsistent branding patterns. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a brief overview of contemporary theoretical approaches to the brand value building and managing in terms of globalisation and to detect actual brand's equity paradigm on the basis of convergences and divergences in these approaches. We used modified methods of semantic analysis and chronological benchmark.

Shaping appropriate transport policy and actions for urban mobility are important elements of the sustainable development of modern cities. The concept of sustainable urban mobility is closely connected with the goals of improving energy consumption and environmental indicators in urban areas. In the case of agglomerations and large cities, the organization and management of traffic as well as shaping appropriate communication habits have a decisive influence on transport pollution. Contemporary agglomerations are particularly interested in the development of public transport and the use of advanced technical and organizational solutions in this area. Urban public transport is a public service, essential to the functioning of cities, and thus to economic development in modern countries. This approach is in line with the general trend, which is visible not only in Poland but all over the world. The aim of the paper is to present solutions in urban transport affecting sustainable urban development. Increasing traffic congestion in city centres, problems with commuting to the city centre at peak hours and insufficient parking space will naturally encourage residents to seek means of transport other than their own cars. Advanced and eco-friendly implementation of integrated transport solutions provides an opportunity to reduce both road congestion and the harmful impact of road transport on the environment.","[Kos, Barbara] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Kos, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",barbara.kos@ue.katowice.pl,,"Kos, Barbara/0000-0001-5814-5454",,,,,23,0,0,2,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1052,1060,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202003,0

The quadratic spending effects disappear for districts managed by directly elected executives and those that perform well on their financial audits. For these arguably less corrupt districts the impact of spending on services is positive across the entire range of expenditure. The consistently beneficial impact of less corrupt district spending on service access is mitigated, however, by rising dependence on intergovernmental transfers.","[Lewis, Blane D.] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Lewis, BD (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",blane.lewis@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,37,18,20,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Employing a unique dataset, regression analysis was undertaken to estimate the predicted probabilities of firms upgrading in GVCs considering their regional location. The results suggest that firms located in Mexico City are more likely to achieve functional upgrading vis-a-vis northern firms. Additionally, the presence of a research and development laboratory is crucial if firms are to engage in upgrading. There was no evidence that government support affects the likelihood of firms achieving functional and/or inter-sectoral upgrading.","[Martinez-Covarrubias, Juan L.] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Grad Res Ctr, Limerick, Ireland; [Lenihan, Helena] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland; [Hart, Mark] Aston Univ, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Hart, Mark] Aston Univ, Enterprise Res Ctr, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Limerick; University of Limerick; Aston University; Aston University,"Hart, M (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Econ Finance & Entrepreneurship Grp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Hart, M (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Enterprise Res Ctr, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",juan74luis.mc@gmail.com; helena.lenihan@ul.ie; mark.hart@aston.ac.uk,"Lenihan, Helena/KBD-4415-2024","Lenihan, Helena/0000-0001-6038-0904; Hart, Mark/0000-0002-0402-4128",European Network on Industrial Policy (EUNIP)/University of Limerick (UL) Scholarship; National Council for Science and Technology in Mexico (CONACYT); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Network on Industrial Policy (EUNIP)/University of Limerick (UL) Scholarship; National Council for Science and Technology in Mexico (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Juan L.

In 2014, twenty mystery shoppers were trained and sent into 24 EV-certified dealerships (with a total of 95 shopping experiences) to observe the sales approach towards EVs. Results show that a common barrier for shoppers is the unavailability of EVs at the dealership including a lack of EV models on site to view or test-drive as well as a three- to four-month waiting period to receive the vehicle once ordered. A multiple regression model was developed to explore which factors influence the likelihood of deciding to purchase an EV. Findings suggest that, controlling for brand, the key success factors are a salesperson's positive attitude and the availability of an EV on site. It is important for future policy makers to acknowledge the influential role of market intermediaries, such as dealerships, in the adoption of EVs. The research findings demonstrate a potential for government agencies to work with dealerships and/or salespeople to improve EV uptake by encouraging the presence of floor models and vehicles for test-driving on site, and by increasing the accuracy of information being provided to customers.","[Matthews, Lindsay] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Lynes, Jennifer; Cloet, Nicholas] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Riemer, Manuel] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Psychol, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Del Matto, Tania] My Sustainable Canada, Kitchener, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Lynes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",lindsay.matthews@uwaterloo.ca; jklynes@uwaterloo.ca; mriemer@wlu.ca; tdelmatt@uwaterloo.ca; Nicholas@mysuscan.org,,"Del Matto, Tania/0009-0009-7611-2774",,,,,56,68,71,2,72,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,79,88,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.001,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900009,0

The arrival of each foreign investor is connected to the creation of new working positions and therefore many students from the mentioned programme work in foreign companies. The aim of the education is the acquisition of managerial, professional competencies and skills that contribute to intercultural dialogue, the prevention of conflicts or to the understanding of other cultures.

The proposed models are particularly attractive for relatively high dimensional applications, involving 50 or more variables, and can be combined with semiparametric marginal distributions to obtain flexible multivariate distributions. Factor copulas generally lack a closed form density, but we obtain analytical results for the implied tail dependence using extreme value theory, and we verify that simulation-based estimation using rank statistics is reliable even in high dimensions. We consider scree plots to aid the choice of the number of factors in the model. The model is applied to daily returns on all 100 constituents of the S&P 100 index, and we find significant evidence of tail dependence, heterogeneous dependence, and asymmetric dependence, with dependence being stronger in crashes than in booms. We also show that factor copula models provide superior estimates of some measures of systemic risk.

Five regions gave concrete support policies for college students to start their undertakings, conducted comparative analysis, probed into the causes of different policies at the same time, and put forward suggestions and countermeasures in order to better implement the policy of starting their own businesses.","[Qian, Min; Wang, Tingting] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xuanwu St, Nanjing Town, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Qian, M (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xuanwu St, Nanjing Town, Peoples R China.",1684356170@qq.com; wangtingtingllf@163.com,"wang, tingting/AAK-2640-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-452-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,179.0,,,,,,435,438,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854700091,0

Evidence from European regions. Regional Studies. The paper investigates the impact of distance, contiguity and technological proximity on cross-regional knowledge flows by comparing the evidence concerning co-inventorship, applicant-inventor relationships and citation flows. Evidence is found of significant differences across these diverse kinds of knowledge flows for what concerns the role of distance, and the moderating role of contiguity and technological proximity. Moreover, it is shown that border effects may prove crucial in a twofold sense. On the one hand, contiguity between regions belonging to two different countries still plays a moderating role, although weaker as compared with that of within-country contiguity. On the other hand, regions sharing a frontier with a foreign country are more likely to exchange knowledge with this foreign country than other regions which are far from the border.","[Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy; [Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy; [Usai, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, Ctr Ric Econ Nord Sud CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Cagliari,"Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Turin, Italy.;Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy.",Francesco.quatraro@unito.it; stefanousai@unica.it,"Usai, Stefano/GPK-7547-2022; Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239; Usai, Stefano/0000-0001-5619-1350",European Commission within the European Union [266959]; Directorate-General for Research and Innovation,European Commission within the European Union; Directorate-General for Research and Innovation,"Francesco Quatraro acknowledges the funding of the European Commission within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [grant agreement number 266959 (PICK-ME)]; Directorate-General for Research and Innovation.",,42,23,25,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

As a result of the research authors came to the conclusion that the main parameter that can significantly reflect the real welfare in current international circumstances should be consumption expenditures, including the cost of food, produced and consumed in the household. Thus, using final consumption expenditure as a welfare index, multidimensional models for the household poverty measurement in the Russian Federation regions are created. Data on consumption expenditures are taken from the Household Budget Survey conducted by the Federal Statistics Service in all regions of the Russian Federation. The survey covers 51322 private households throughout the Russian Federation, with the exception of the Chechen Republic, and is regionally representative. As a result of correlation and regression analysis factors that influence the rate of household consumption expenditure in the modern globalized world are identified for all regions of the Russian Federation. It is proved that the fact of living in rural area and household enlargement have negative impact on its final consumption expenditure in most regions of the Russian Federation. The proposed regional multidimensional models for poverty measurement give an opportunity to the federal and regional authorities being under globalization challenge to form and implement effective anti-poverty policy and target it on most vulnerable households.","[Sadyrtdinov, Ruslan; Korablev, Maksim] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia; [Vladimirova, Svetlana] Moscow City Govt Univ Management, Moscow, Russia",Kazan Federal University,"Sadyrtdinov, R (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia.",s_ryslan@mail.ru; korablevmm@gmail.com; svetkinson@gmail.com,"Sadyrtdinov, Ruslan R/M-2367-2015","Sadyrtdinov, Ruslan R/0000-0001-8312-1390",Kazan Federal University,Kazan Federal University,This research was supported by the research grant of Kazan Federal University.,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2236,2243,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204019,0

After controlling for the effects of human capital, research and development (R&D) expenditures, R&D personnel, economic development and urbanization, the study confirms a significantly positive effect of FDI on innovation. Findings show that although the regions with a higher level of human capital benefited more from FDI-related spillovers, human capital per se affected innovation adversely when absorptive capacity was added to the model.","[Smith, Natalya] Heelstone Consulting Ltd, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Thomas, Ekaterina] Staffordshire Univ, Fac Business Educ & Law, Stock On Trent, England",Staffordshire University,"Smith, N (通讯作者)，Heelstone Consulting Ltd, Manchester, Lancs, England.",n.smith@heelstoneconsulting.com; e.thomas@staffs.ac.uk,,,,,,,90,35,36,4,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Functioning under non-market conditions, instability of law and restrictions for conducting medical activity, as well as limitations in ensuring long-term revenue stability (mainly from public resources) constitute other management problems. Another problem and an opportunity at the same time is relative freedom of patients' movement between regions and countries which, at least partially, seems to be a consequence of globalization. Globalization also results in adoption of foreign patterns of hospital organization, as well as patterns of providing services. The growing competition in health services market causes the creation of different business models in healthcare, capable of covering high fixed cost, while ensuring financial goals' achievement. This, in turn, directly results in diversity of the hospitals' operation cost structure. As a result, the comparability of financial reports is limited, and detailed cost data analysis is restricted by a number of additional factors, such as detailed cost drivers for settlement of overhead cost.The aim of the paper is to present the selected business models of hospitals, concerning their organizational aspect, and their reflection in the structure of operation costs. The hypothesis states that the diversity of hospital business model design results in costs incomparability. The paper uses the methods of meta-analysis of the literature, observation, case-study and cause and effect relationship analysis, as well as the method of synthesis in order to formulate final conclusions.","[Szewieczek, Aleksandra] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Ul Bogucicka 3, PL-40257 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Szewieczek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Ul Bogucicka 3, PL-40257 Katowice, Poland.",aleksandra.szewieczek@ue.katowice.pl,"Szewieczek, Aleksandra/HZL-8687-2023","Szewieczek, Aleksandra/0000-0002-2408-0856",,,,,24,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2610,2617,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205001,0

The production results achieved can be destroyed due to low-tech turnover level, and the relationship between production and consumption will not give the expected results of the agricultural production. The main hypothesis of this article is that we need to increase the level of technologies in agricultural production and bringing agricultural products to consumers, at all stages of the production-consumption relationship. So we propose to assess the market performance from the perspective of technological stages.

These are, for example, the charges for: reactive energy, the lowering energy quality and also the charges for the development of renewable energy sources. In the article an analysis of the components of electricity costs in selected European countries was presented. Particular attention was paid to the components other than the active energy. In the article the correlation between the components of electricity costs and the policy of particular countries was presented. This type of policy is driven by the need to reduce the energy consumption by industrial equipment and households. A distinctive element in the relation between the components of the energy cost versus state policy is global policy for the development of renewable energy sources.

The cognition of e-commerce of family farms and growers is significantly affected by the scale of operation, not affected by the type of industry, while cooperatives and agricultural enterprises are the opposite. External factors have little effect on the cognitive behavior of e-commerce operators, but the difference is larger. Therefore, in order to better promote the development of rural e-commerce, we should not only focus on setting up rural e-commerce technology forums to enhance farmers' e-commerce awareness, but also strengthen rural e-commerce infrastructure construction and optimize the environment for technology promotion.

However, energy polices aiming at energy savings may not be as good as expected due to the existence of rebound effects. The motivation of the paper is to analysis the nexus between technical progress and energy rebound effects. Based on a three-input trans-log cost function model, we first estimate the share equation and the corresponding price elasticity for each input factor. Then, the rebound effect in China's iron & steel industry over 1985-2015 is evaluated through decomposing the energy prices. Empirical results show that: (1) The price elasticities of input factors are negative; (2) Energy/capital and energy/labor show substitute relationships; (3) The average energy rebound effect in the ISI is as high as 73.88%; (4) The energy rebound effect shows a downward trend before the 11th Five-year period and then an upward trend after that. Therefore, policies proposals of lowering the rebound effect should be placed not only on technical progress, but also on energy price reform by reducing energy subsidies and thus accelerating energy price marketization, so as to promote energy substitution, reduce energy rebound effect and produce further economic and environmental benefits.","[Wang, Xiaolei; Wen, Xiaohui] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xie, Chunping] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",China University of Mining & Technology; University of Birmingham,"Xie, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",,"wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022; Xie, Chunping/G-8571-2016","wang, xiao/0000-0002-4088-3341; Xie, Chunping/0000-0003-2100-6631",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology [2017QNB03],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology,The paper is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China University of Mining and Technology (No. 2017QNB03).,,46,31,32,2,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,259,265,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.016,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700026,0

This study explored the spatiotemporal profile of PM2.5 concentrations in China from 1998 to 2016, examined its relationship with urbanization and other socioeconomic factors, including industry, abatement investment, and clean energy consumption by constructing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model, and interpreted its responses to urbanization and these factors using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The results showed that PM2.5 pollution generally presented a worsening situation in most provinces during the study period. PM2.5-urbanization relationship approved an inverted U-shape EKC pattern in whole China and the central and eastern region, but presented an N-shape EKC pattern in the developed eastern region. Industry and its interaction with urbanization drove increasing PM2.5 concentrations. The interactions of urbanization with abatement investment and clean energy consumption had negative effects on PM2.5 concentrations nationally, but showed different impacts across regions. The GAM's results further verified that PM2.5 concentrations increased along with urbanization and industry, but enhancing abatement investment and clean energy consumption can reverse the increased trend.

This paper investigates the existence of a positive feedback cycle by developing a theoretical model based on simultaneous equations and estimating it using the three stage least squares approach using data from the UK, Australian and Irish Markets. Results indicate strong support for the idea of a positive feedback cycle. This reinforces the need for stakeholders to consider this issue in framing future energy policies to ensure that the adoption of solar PV is supported in a sustainable way, while not punishing non-adopters with higher electricity rates.","[Chesser, Michael; Hanly, Jim; Casselis, Damien] Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Aungier St, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Apergis, Nicholas] Univ Piraeus, Dept Financial Management & Banking, Piraeus, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Hanly, J (通讯作者)，Dublin Inst Technol, Coll Business, Aungier St, Dublin 2, Ireland.",james.hanly@dit.ie,,"Hanly, Jim/0000-0002-4296-0347; Cassells, Damien/0000-0002-8501-8853; Chesser, Michael/0000-0002-8548-5339; , Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",Dublin Institute of Technology,Dublin Institute of Technology,Chesser acknowledges a Fiosraigh Dean of Graduate School Award from Dublin Institute of Technology.,,44,25,26,4,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,36,44,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.032,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700005,0

Combining well data provided by drillinginfo.com and FBI incident-level crime data; we examine intra-county changes in both property and violent crime in Colorado as wells open and shut down. We find a positive relationship between the well density of a county and both violent and property crimes.

In this paper, alternative discounting approaches are compared to examine their effect on measuring preferences and values using data from a survey examining public preferences for the protection of an endangered species. Exponential and hyperbolic discounting assumptions lead to very similar results in terms of both model fit and welfare. All estimated models suggest future payments are discounted at a very high rate. Several factors likely influencing the magnitude of these estimated discount rates are discussed, and then an argument is made for using payment vehicles in stated preference studies that employ a single lump sum payment rather than a series of future payments.

As industry and governments have an interest in counteracting this negative trend by incentivizing EV purchasing, a better understanding of potential EV adopters and drivers of early adoption becomes paramount for designing effective and efficient incentive schemes. Therefore, drawing on a representative survey of Austrian citizens, this study analyzes early adopters, potential adopters, and non-adopters of EVs. Findings indicate that psychological and, to a lesser extent, socio-demographic factors play a significant role in predicting EV adoption. Non-adopters are more likely to have an individualistic and less egalitarian worldview, and also, compared to early adopters, to fall short in terms of pro-environmental and pro-technological attitude. Further, early adopters are inclined to live in regions with EV policy incentives. Using cluster analysis, this study identifies four groups of potential EV adopters based on their evaluation of EV purchasing and non-purchasing motives. The potential-adopter segments differ considerably in their socio-demographic and psychological characteristics, as well as in their preferences for policy incentives. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of effective policy schemes and marketing measures.","[Priessner, Alfons; Sposato, Robert; Hampl, Nina] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Operat Energy & Environm Management, Sustainable Energy Management Unit, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Austria; [Hampl, Nina] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Strateg Management, Welthandelpl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Priessner, A (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Operat Energy & Environm Management, Sustainable Energy Management Unit, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Austria.",alfons.priessner@gmail.com,,"Hampl, Nina/0000-0001-6197-3699; Sposato, Robert/0000-0001-7724-5653",Deloitte Austria (Austria); Wien Energie (Austria),Deloitte Austria (Austria); Wien Energie (Austria),"This study received funding for data collection from Deloitte Austria (Austria) and Wien Energie (Austria).

The adoption rate of electric vehicles in Sweden is however relatively slow and varies substantially across municipalities. This study empirically examines the impact of local policy instruments designed to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. We use panel data between 2010 and 2016 to estimate the effect of local policy instruments on the share of newly registered battery electric vehicles in Swedish municipalities. We find that an increased number of public charging points increases the adoption rate, especially in urban municipalities. The results further suggest that public procurement of battery electric vehicles has the potential to be an effective policy instrument. Finally, we find that by adjusting policy instruments to the specific characteristics of municipalities and making them visible to the public, their effectiveness can be increased.","[Egner, Filippa] Swedish Natl Board Housing Bldg & Planning, Drottninggatan 18, S-37131 Karlskrona, Sweden; [Trosvik, Lina] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Trosvik, L (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Vasagatan 1, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",filippaegner@gmail.com; lina.trosvik@economics.gu.se,,"Trosvik, Lina/0000-0002-8511-882X",Nordic Energy Research; project Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport (SHIFT),Nordic Energy Research; project Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport (SHIFT),"Research funding by the Nordic Energy Research and the project Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport (SHIFT) is gratefully acknowledged.

This paper analyzes the convergence of cross-province energy intensity in China based on panel data of 29 provinces for the period 2003-2015 by means of sigma convergence, kernel density analysis, and unconditional and conditional beta convergence. The empirical results show that the omission of spatial spillovers underestimates conditional beta convergence. We thus argue that the implementation of effective policy for reducing energy intensity depends not only on the driving forces in the own province but also on the spatial spillover effects in neighboring provinces, particularly technology transfer, knowledge spillovers, and the input-output relationship. From the analysis, it follows that adopting low-energy capital, attracting more FDI inflows and developing indigenous innovation capabilities are major policy handles.","[Jiang, Lei] Nanchang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lei] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Ji, Minhe] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Zhou, P.] China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Nanchang University; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; University of Groningen; East China Normal University; China University of Petroleum,"Zhou, P (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Econ & Management, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",lei_jiang@zufe.edu.cn; pzhou@upc.edu.cn,"Zhou, Peng/A-6527-2012; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; Zhao, YiAn/JFK-5881-2023","Zhou, Peng/0000-0003-4726-3054;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573119, 71625005]; Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education [17YJC790061]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education,"The authors are grateful to the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71573119 and 71625005), and Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education (No. 17YJC790061).",,48,74,77,8,91,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,252,263,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.043,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800026,0

Consequently, DMUs are likely to experience substantial differences in productivity and efficiency levels. In contrast, the received literature assumes that DMUs share similar technological possibilities and only differ with respect to their level of inefficiency. This study develops an analytical framework using random parameters, which accommodates heterogeneity in production possibilities and in characteristics of the production environment. We use this framework to analyze variations in the output elasticity of irrigation across DMUs, and how these differences influence: 1) irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), using a non-radial input-oriented approach that isolates and measures the efficient use of the irrigation input; 2) technical efficiency, which radially measures the efficient utilization of all inputs; and 3) shadow prices of irrigation withdrawals. We find that IWUE and technical efficiency averaged 72.6% and 83.6%, respectively, and shadow prices averaged $77.5 per million gallons of irrigation water, albeit with significant regional variations.","[Njuki, Eric; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, Talca, Chile",University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca,"Njuki, E (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",eric.njuki@uconn.edu; boris.bravoureta@uconn.edu,,"Njuki, Eric/0000-0002-1000-4609","National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2016-67012-24678, 2016-67024-24760]",National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This study was support by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant # 2016-67012-24678 (EN) and Grant # 2016-67024-24760 (BBU).

In particular, a series of major events in the 1970s led most states in the US to look for partial alternatives to fossil fuels for electricity generation. We notably observe changes for 26 states between the years 1968 and 1980. Starting with the premise that a more diversified grid mix is preferable from a robustness viewpoint, and by using 2015 data, we then evaluate the response of all states under multiple energy source disruption scenarios and detect three different classes of states: vulnerable (10 states), moderately robust (17 states), and robust (23 states). Expectedly, some states are particularly vulnerable as they depend predominantly on a single energy source (e.g., West Virginia with 95% coal usage). In contrast, we find seven states (i.e., South Dakota, Illinois, Vermont, Connecticut, Maine, New York, and New Jersey) that have particularly robust energy mix, while having fossil fuel shares below 50% in 2015.","[Ahmad, Nasir; Derrible, Sybil] Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks CSUN Lab, Engn Res Facil 2095, 842 W Taylor St,M-C 246, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Ahmad, N (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Complex & Sustainable Urban Networks CSUN Lab, Engn Res Facil 2095, 842 W Taylor St,M-C 246, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",sahmad38@uic.edu; derrible@uic.edu,,"Derrible, Sybil/0000-0002-2939-6016; Ahmad, Nasir/0000-0001-5067-7368","National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberSEES Award [CCF-1331800]; NSF CAREER Award [1551731]; NSF CPS Award [1646395]; Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1646395] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1551731] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1331800] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberSEES Award; NSF CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NSF CPS Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CyberSEES Award CCF-1331800, the NSF CAREER Award 1551731, the NSF CPS Award 1646395, and by the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",,45,8,8,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,167,174,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.035,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300016,0

It implies mobile storages that could - during long phases of immobility - provide services for the electricity sector. However, this technical option - called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) - requires the vehicle users to temporarily abstain from the usage of their batteries for V2G. A reasonable estimate of the potential of V2G thus considers which individual, technical and economic parameters are decisive for the willingness of vehicle users to participate. To answer these questions a representative sample of vehicle users in Germany has been surveyed - including a discrete choice experiment. 'Range anxiety' and the 'minimum range' proved most important determinants of the willingness of vehicle users to participate in V2G. If these concerns are smoothed out, even without remuneration, high participation rates might be achieved. To increase the participation in the V2G technology, the transition from 'tank control' to 'mobility demand articulation' should be facilitated for vehicle users. Therefore, companies could tailor the V2G design to customers' needs and policy could improve information about V2G.

It occurs in regional science especially when independent variables include the distances from urban facilities. This paper proposes a new method for deriving the configuration of sample points that reduces multicollinearity in regression models with distance variables. Multicollinearity is evaluated by the maximum absolute correlation coefficient between distance variables. A spatial optimization technique is utilized to calculate the optimal configuration of sample points. The method permits us not only to locate sample points appropriately but also to evaluate the location of facilities from which the distance is measured in terms of the correlation between distance variables in a systematic way. Numerical experiments and empirical applications are performed to test the validity of the method. The results support the technical soundness of the proposed method and provided some useful implications for the design of sample location.,"[Sadahiro, Yukio] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan; [Wang, Yan] Univ Tokyo, Dept Urban Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Sadahiro, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",sada@csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,50,1,2,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Consideration is further given to studying the mediating effects of local subsidies on new firm survival given different existing local industrial structures in those regions. In support of the regional branching' hypothesis, we find that increasing local related variety has a stronger positive effect on new firm survival than other types of agglomeration. We also find that receiving comparatively fewer subsidies motivates firms to seek out and benefit from local existing economies, which in turn, positively influence their chances of survival. By contrast, agglomerated firms that receive relatively more subsidies tend to be more likely to face financial distress leading to eventual market exit. The findings thus reveal that both the intensity and the location of state support matters in terms of optimizing positive agglomeration effects on firms' post-entry performance and survival.","[Howell, Anthony; Yang, Rudai] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Fan, C.

Expanded extraction activities are expected to boost the U.S. economy at relatively small rates because the oil and natural gas extraction industries comprise a small share of GDP compared to other U.S. industries. However, this expansion may have substantial implications on energy sectors, with considerable growth expected in the oil and petroleum products manufacturing industry. The U.S. trade balance for energy resources may be improved through increased exports of crude oil (108%), natural gas (26%), and petroleum products (10%). Such increased exports of energy from the U.S. are important supplies to the international energy market given the substantial role of the U.S. in global energy trade. In the domestic market, U.S. households enjoy lower prices of fossil fuels and electricity as a result of expanded extraction.","[Nong, Duy; Countryman, Amanda M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Warziniack, Travis] Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO USA",Colorado State University,"Nong, D (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",duy.nong@colostate.edu; amanda.countryman@colostate.edu; twwarziniack@fs.fed.us,"Warziniack, Travis/JXL-2826-2024; Nong, Duy/AAH-5991-2019","Warziniack, Travis/0000-0002-9431-2288; Nong, Duy/0000-0002-4632-9835",,,,,39,11,11,1,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,574,584,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.003,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200054,0

According to the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Commission, there have been set common goals for the share of consumption of renewable energies in the European Union, but each country is responsible for the action plan to achieve these targets. These targets have been set based on the initial values of the renewable energies and on the natural resources of each country. Cultural aspects and energy consumption patterns have not been taken in consideration for the analysis of the willingness and motivation of consumers to switch towards renewable energies. In this paper a panel data analysis has been carried out in order to measure the relation between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the share of renewable energies in final consumption. The results show a highly significant relation between the masculinity index and the share of renewable energies and an acceptable relation for the long term orientation index. The energy policy of the European Union and of its countries should consider the cultural characteristics in the development of the national action plans for the implementation of renewable energies.","[Pelau, Corina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm Foreign Languages, Calea Grivitei 2-2A,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Pop, Nicolae Al.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studios, Fac Mkt, Bd Dacia 41,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pelau, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm Foreign Languages, Calea Grivitei 2-2A,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",corina.pelau@fabiz.ase.ro; nicolae.pop@mk.ase.ro,"Pelau, Corina/F-4663-2015; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/L-9045-2016","Pelau, Corina/0000-0002-6139-028X; Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/0000-0003-4565-4879",,,,,59,36,36,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,160,168,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.042,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000016,0

These programs have been criticized on a number of fronts. In particular, critics claim the level of support was excessive and creating surplus supply. However, prior studies have ignored one potential benefit of renewable energy support that it can help to promote cost reductions in new technologies through learning-by-doing. This paper uses a recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model featuring learning-by doing effects to assess the renewable support programs provided in Ontario. Our results, in line with previous studies, do not justify the high support rates paid in Ontario given our core range of assumptions. But our modeling approach allows us to identify the combination of key parameter values relating to learning effects and environmental damages that justify the observed rates. These parameters are hard to measure empirically, and our modeling approach introduces a new tool for examining the impact of variations in these parameters on policy analysis.","[Wigle, Randall] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, 67 Erb St West, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 120 Univ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Inst Environm, 555 King Edward Ave, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Wigle, Randall] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Lazaridis Sch Business & Econ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Beck, Marisa] Univ Ottawa, Inst Sci Soc & Policy, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Ottawa,"Beck, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Inst Sci Soc & Policy, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",mbeck2@uottawa.ca; nicholas.rivers@uottawa.ca; rwigle@wlu.ca,,,Carbon Management Canada [D387]; Sustainable Prosperity [490063-726099-2001],Carbon Management Canada; Sustainable Prosperity,"The authors acknowledge support from Carbon Management Canada (D387) and Sustainable Prosperity (490063-726099-2001).

Earthquake certificates give homeowners a right to yearly compensation for both property damage and degradation of living space. The level of compensation is a percentage of the joint annual gas revenues of the Dutch government, Shell and ExxonMobil and may vary based on the intensity of earthquakes in the previous year. These certificates are tradable within the Netherlands to stimulate the illiquid housing market in the province of Groningen. Although frequent earthquakes have decreased property values in this province, a seller will still receive an efficient price for his house because he can also sell his earthquake certificate. A buyer of this certificate receives an annual stream of income and may use these revenues, for instance, to repay his mortgage or to maintain his house at reduced tax levels. However, multiple implementation problems make the viability of this market-based instrument difficult if not questionable, such as the political decision on the aforementioned level of revenue sharing and the behavioral complexity of the options that tradable earthquake certificates offer to homeowners.","[Woerdman, Edwin] Univ Groningen, Fac Law, Dept Business Law European Law & Tax Law, POB 716, NL-9700 AS Groningen, Netherlands; [Dulleman, Minne] TKP Pensioen BV, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Woerdman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Law, Dept Business Law European Law & Tax Law, POB 716, NL-9700 AS Groningen, Netherlands.",e.woerdman@rug.nl,,"Woerdman, Edwin/0000-0003-2883-160X",,,,,31,1,1,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,370,376,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.020,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600036,0

The paper uses generalised trust and about 20 other trust (and trustworthiness)-related indicators and investigates which trust-related variables explain inventive activity in 20 European countries divided into 135 regions with a special focus on causal, nonlinear and spatial forces. The findings indicate that only generalised trust and non-egoistic fairness have robust effects on inventive activity in Europe. Using historical data on the extent and existence of universities as instruments, a causal relationship between trust and inventive activity is set up. Even after controlling for causal, spatial and nonlinear forces, there is a significant direct impact of trust on inventive activity. The result show that a one standard deviation rise in general trust (a 12.5 % rise in the trust level) increases patents per million inhabitants on average by 2 %. Despite the growing literature that associate social capital to inventive activity at the regional level, the direct policy conclusions are weak. This paper argues that moving from regional learning to learning region may induce researchers to consider direct and down-to-earth policy implications.","[Akcomak, I.

However, it is not clear whether it will in practice provide a blueprint for the future. The Review did not benefit from the usual process of consultation and evidence gathering, which took place only after its publication. Its recommendations are essentially personal - many seem either unrealistic or controversial. The Review's main contribution may therefore turn out to be its analysis of the changes under way in electricity and the problems with the UK's current policy approach, including its excessive complexity.

The objective of the paper is to assess the Karnataka power sector performance in the context of reforms, using select technical and financial indicators. A Power Sector Performance Index (PPI) is computed to capture the overall performance. Some indicators, like energy and peak deficits, per capita electricity consumption, have shown improvement after reform, nonetheless, they still lag behind other major Indian states. The installed capacity increased fairly after reform, however, the capacity utilisation rate declined in the post-reform period. On the positive note, the transmission and distribution (T&D) loss in Karnataka reduced tremendously since 1999 as compared to other major states. Average revenue realisation rate rose after reform, however, the realisation rate varies widely across consumer categories, due to cross-subsidization by few categories. Overall, the PPI value increased from 1998-99 to 2012-13 indicating better performance after reform. The ranking improved from 8th to 3th position, implying higher progress over time vis-a-vis other states as well. There is, however, scope for further improvement.

This paper examines the potential energy mix up to 2030 at the regional level, and identifies the need to accelerate electricity system reforms to expand the transregional access to renewable electricity generation. By analysing available data, we assess how regional renewable energy potentials can be put to effective use, and identify how electricity reform should proceed, to both capitalise on renewables and reduce carbon intensity. Finally, we report the large renewable potentials in Japan. However, in order to maximise the use of these potentials, a combination of technologies and policies are required to promote flexible grid operation, and strengthen transmission capacity and renewable priority dispatch order, as well as to introduce technology for stabilizing electricity systems supplied by renewable electricity, such as pumped storage hydropower, storage cells, and demand-response, which can store surplus energy until it is needed.","[Wakiyama, Takako; Kuriyama, Akihisa] IGES, Miura Dist, Kanagawa, Japan; [Wakiyama, Takako] Univ Sydney, ISA, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Wakiyama, T (通讯作者)，IGES, Miura Dist, Kanagawa, Japan.;Wakiyama, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, ISA, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",takako.wakiyama@mx.iges.or.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP 16K21703]; World Resources Institute through the Open Climate Network; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K21703] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); World Resources Institute through the Open Climate Network; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number JP 16K21703, and conducted as an extension to a study funded by the World Resources Institute through the Open Climate Network in 2014-2015.

This study uses British household data from the Survey of Public Attitudes and Behaviours towards the Environment collected in 2009, and employs nonlinear principal components analysis (NLPCA), ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and probit models. The results show different household profiles with specific features driving daily energy-saving behaviours and energy efficiency investments. Environmental variables are a good predictor of both energy-saving behaviours and investment in energy efficient appliances but not of energy efficient retrofit measures. Results of income and dwelling type variables with regard to energy-saving behaviours and energy efficient retrofit investments significantly diverge; in addition, interesting patterns emerge with respect to the respondents' age, sex, and marital status. By evaluating and understanding the household and dwelling characteristics that affect energy-saving behaviours and energy efficiency investments, it is possible to obtain a clearer idea of where and how energy and emissions savings can be made, and to propose effective and targeted policies that promote energy-responsible lifestyles.","[Trotta, Gianluca] Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies Econ & Business Law Econ, Dept Econ, Off Tervahovi D210,Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland",University of Vaasa,"Trotta, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies Econ & Business Law Econ, Dept Econ, Off Tervahovi D210,Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland.",Gianluca.Trotta@uva.fi,"Trotta, Gianluca/GOK-1321-2022","Trotta, Gianluca/0000-0003-0734-9857",Academy of Finland [Akatemia/Kalmi/2700041011],Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"This work has been partially supported by the Academy of Finland under the project grant Akatemia/Kalmi/2700041011.

This electricity comes from thermal power plants that use fossil fuels. These emit a large amount of particulate matter, around 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), which can penetrate deepest lung parts (alveoli), causing cardiovascular disease. Mexico has a policy (NOM-028-ENER-2010) that establishes the minimum efficiency for lighting in buildings. However, lighting is often used inappropriately (e.g. daytime or when there are no people using them). One solution for this problem is to use control device technology of multiple types (combination of daylight, motion and presence sensors). However, these strategies have not been fully implemented in Mexico, mainly due to the high cost of commercial control devices. This study aims to know the lost co-benefits when control devices are not implemented for lighting cost reduction, such as: energy saving (kw-h/yr), electricity bill reduction (USD/yr), PM2.5 emission reduction (mu g/m(3)), cardiovascular death reduction (death/yr) and cardiovascular death cost reduction (USD/yr). For those reasons, it is recommended that energy policy decisions regarding building lighting efficiency include the implementation of control devices. Moreover, such policies should be preceded by research studies focused on detailed device cost, co-benefits and socio-economic analysis.","[Diaz-Mendez, S. E.; Torres-Rodriguez, A.

Ensuing disruptions to the coal market caused these policies to be revised and, subsequently, discarded as decision makers tried to find a balance between efficient supply, economic and social stability and environmental sustainability. This paper explores the causes of these unintended consequences using an extended version of the KEM-China model. The results reveal that full and partial compliance with the capacity cut policies results in a significant gap between supply and demand. This suggests that implementation of the policy was technically infeasible, even allowing for a significant increase in coal prices and economic costs. Besides, significant differences in coal prices and output profiles are registered across the country. We argue that the heterogeneous nature of the Chinese coal market and policy compliance was a major factor leading to the unintended consequences rendering a single national price benchmark inappropriate as a policy gauge. We propose that the capacity cut policy should be differentiated across regions and even types of coalmines, market approaches would be preferable to the command-and-control instruments, and policy distortions that cause excess capacity should be removed.","[Shi, Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Rioux, Bertrand; Galkin, Philipp] KAPSARC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Technology Sydney; National University of Singapore,"Shi, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",xunpeng.shi@gmail.com,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395; Williams-Rioux, Bertrand/0000-0003-0518-5609",,,,,56,69,71,5,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,478,486,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.034,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500046,0

This paper contributes to the scientific literature by using an E4 model to analyse the long-term decarbonisation of the Danish transport sector. The study is carried out with TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model of Denmark, which has been expanded in order to endogenously determine modal shares. The methodology extends the technology competition within the modes to competition across modes by aggregating the passenger modal travel demands into demand segments based on the distance range. Modal shift is based not only on the levelised costs of the modes, but also on speed and infrastructure requirement. Constraints derived from the National Travel Survey guarantee consistent travel habits and avoid unrealistic modal shifts. The comparison of model versions with and without modal shift identifies its positive contribution to the fulfilment of the Danish environmental targets. Four sensitivity analyses on the key variables of modal shift assess how their alternative realizations affect the decarbonisation of the transport sector and enable shifting away from car. The results indicate that less strict travel time budget (1113) and increased speed of public bus lead to a more efficient decarbonisation by 2050.","[Tattini, Jacopo; Karlsson, Kenneth] DTU Management Engn, Prod Storvey, Bldg 426, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Gargiulo, Maurizio] E4SMA, Via Livorno 60, I-10144 Turin, Italy",Technical University of Denmark,"Tattini, J (通讯作者)，DTU Management Engn, Prod Storvey, Bldg 426, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",jactat@dtu.dk,"Gargiulo, Maurizio/V-2964-2019","Gargiulo, Maurizio/0000-0001-7735-6441; Tattini, Jacopo/0000-0001-5751-2048; Karlsson, Kenneth Bernard/0000-0001-7749-254X",Innovation Fund Denmark [COMETS 4106-00033 A],Innovation Fund Denmark,"The work presented in this paper is a result of the research activities of COMETS (Co-Management of Energy and Transport Sector) project (COMETS 4106-00033 A), which has received funding from The Innovation Fund Denmark.

Instead, the biofuel use mandate is the primary existing GHG reduction program in the United States. The mandate effectively requires a rising amount of GHG abatement each year, but allows regulated parties to buy and sell credits to meet annual obligations. Although many aspects of the biofuel mandate look similar to a cap-and-trade program, there are additional requirements, such as feedstock eligibility limitations and waivers. The existence of the mandates is presumably conditional on all the legal requirements, but these conditions represent a departure from a strict GHG cap-and-trade program. We estimate GHG abatement costs of the mandate and compare them to a hypothetical cap-and-trade program targeting vehicle fuels. The mandate abatement cost is found to be higher than a hypothetical GHG cap-and-trade. Our results show that the RFS might be judged as a feasible substitute for a cap-and-trade regime that can deliver GHG reductions, but at a higher cost reflecting its multiple objectives.","[Thompson, Wyatt; Whistance, Jarrett] Univ Missouri, Agr & Appl Econ Dept, Columbia, MO 65203 USA; [Thompson, Wyatt; Whistance, Jarrett] Univ Missouri, Food & Agr Policy Res Inst, Columbia, MO 65203 USA; [Johansson, Robert] USDA, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Meyer, Seth] USDA, World Agr Outlook Board, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC 20250 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Thompson, W (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, 101 Pk DeVille Dr,Suite E, Columbia, MO 65203 USA.",thompsonw@missouri.edu,,,"United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [58-0111-15-021]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [MO-HASS0024]","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project","This work is supported by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) cooperative agreement number 58-0111-15-021, and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project number MO-HASS0024, but findings and views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of USDA or the University of Missouri.",,42,11,12,3,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,368,375,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.041,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500036,0

Regional Studies. Across China the lower quartile of firms pays almost no tax, whereas the upper quartile pays the full tax rate of 33%. This paper suggests that a driver of this phenomenon is heterogeneous agglomeration. Using the full sample of medium and large manufacturing firms in China from 2000 to 2007, the empirical estimation results confirm that more agglomerated regions generally collect tax at higher rates. Furthermore, the results show that the tax-agglomeration effect varies with firm mobility: the positive relationship between tax rates and agglomeration holds more for non-state-owned firms, which are more mobile, than for state-owned firms.","[Chen, Yu] Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhigang] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines; [Liu, Zheng] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Macau; Asian Development Bank; University of Hong Kong,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",yuchen@umac.mo; zli@adb.org; jasonliu@hku.hk,"Liu, Zhiyu/JNR-8043-2023; Lu, Lu/JPE-5187-2023","Liu, Zhiyu/0000-0001-8351-1268;",University of Macau [RG045/07-08S/CY/FSH],University of Macau,Financial support from the University of Macau [grant number RG045/07-08S/CY/FSH] is gratefully acknowledged.,,36,7,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A relevant space-aware application domain is the so-called urban computing, embracing issues like the simulation and implementation of public transportation systems, traffic management, urban monitoring and control. The execution of such applications is often distributed on parallel computing nodes, which need to cooperate and exchange data among each other, thus raising synchronization issues. In this paper we analyze time-related characteristics of the computational process in a space-aware application in the case when each node does not need global synchronization (i.e. synchronization with all other nodes) but requires only local synchronization (i.e. synchronization with a subset of neighbor nodes). Performance is evaluated both analytically and numerically. We provide the analytical support to an important conclusion: the mean computation time per step remains finite irrespective of the number of nodes under local synchronization, while under global synchronization it grows unboundedly as the number of nodes increases. In practical scenarios this corresponds to significantly better scalability properties of local synchronization.","[Cicirelli, Franco; Forestiero, Agostino; Giordano, Andrea; Mastroianni, Carlo] ICAR CNR, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Razumchik, Rostislav] FRC CSC RAS, Inst Informat Problems, Moscow, Russia; [Razumchik, Rostislav] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, Moscow, Russia",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Calcolo e Reti ad Alte Prestazioni (ICAR-CNR); Federal Research Center Computer Science & Control of RAS; Institute of Informatics Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences; Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Cicirelli, F (通讯作者)，ICAR CNR, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",cicirelli@icar.cnr.it; forestiero@icar.cnr.it; giordano@icar.cnr.it; mastroianni@icar.cnr.it; rrazumchik@ipiran.ru,"Forestiero, Agostino/AAW-9191-2020; mastroianni, carlo/AAY-6541-2020; Razumchik, Rostislav/A-4797-2016","mastroianni, carlo/0000-0001-6269-4931; Razumchik, Rostislav/0000-0002-4092-5396; FORESTIERO, AGOSTINO/0000-0002-3025-7689",,,,,27,2,2,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,491,497,,10.7148/2018-0491,0.0,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000072,0

But the world did not become safer. International terrorism has become more active which was declared as the main threat to peace. After the end of the global confrontation between two different ideological systems, local regional military conflicts came to the fore (first of all in the Near and Middle East, North Africa). As it turned out, it is possible to overcome the ideological confrontation, but it is impossible to abolish the opposite geopolitical interests of the countries that have become accustomed to pursuing an independent policy.

A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) was constructed together with energy consumption with CO2 emission were compiled, and then calibrated with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. A simulation experiment was conducted by applying a 30% reduction of subsidy to the electricity sector. This policy shock was applied to the model in two scenarios. In scenario 1, the subsidy reduction was applied and results were compared with the baseline scenario given in the SAM. This yielded adverse economic effects on most endogenous variables but positive environmental benefits in terms of CO2 emission reduction. Electricity tariff increased by three-fold from 2 to 6 fils (0.7 cents to 2 cents) per kWh. GDP fell by 0.5% and aggregate household welfare declined by 0.8%. In scenario 2, subsidy reduction was accompanied with cash transfers to compensate user losses.

The ML-MPD method estimates the underlying behavioral decision process leading to a person's willingness to pay for river recreation site attributes. Empirical choice probabilities, willingness to pay measures for recreation site attributes, and marginal effects of changes in some explanatory variables are estimated. For comparison purposes, a Logit model is also implemented. A Wald test of the symmetric logistic distribution underlying the Logit model is rejected at the 0.01 level in favor of the ML-MPD distribution model. Our results also demonstrate the potential for substantially overstating the precision of the estimates and associated inferences when the imposition of unknown structural information is not accounted explicitly for in the model.

Here we examine the environmental and economic costs of hypothetical future renewable-energy-focused cases compared with the current nuclear and hydroelectricity-centred mix in Sweden. We show that if wind and photovoltaics replace entire nuclear power while maintaining the current level of dispatchable backup capacity including hydroelectric power and peak gas power, 154 GW of wind power will be required and will generate 427.1 TWh (compared with the actual demand of 143.7 TWh) to reliably meet demand each hour of the year. As a consequence, the annual spending on electricity systems will be five times higher than the status quo. Increasing dispatchable power, increasing transmission capacities to other countries, and generating electricity from combined heat and power plants even when there is no heat demand, will together reduce the required capacities of wind and solar photovoltaic by half, but it will double the greenhouse gas emissions during the combustion process. In conclusion, our economic and greenhouse-gas emissions analyses demonstrate that replacing nuclear power with renewables will be neither economic nor environmentally friendly with regards to the climate.","[Hong, Sanghyun; Brook, Barry W.] Univ Tasmania, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Qvist, Staffan] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Uppsala, Sweden",University of Tasmania; Uppsala University,"Hong, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Sanghyun.hong@utas.edu.au,"Brook, Barry W./G-2686-2011; Hong, Sanghyun/N-3599-2017","Brook, Barry W./0000-0002-2491-1517; Hong, Sanghyun/0000-0001-6754-2291",,,,,31,16,19,1,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,56,66,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.013,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800008,0

These models are most suitable for modeling financial time series and follow the general framework of the popular non-Gaussian OU models of Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard. One current problem of these otherwise attractive nontrivial models is, in general, the unavailability of a tractable likelihood-based statistical analysis for the returns of financial assets, which requires the ability to sample from a nontrivial joint distribution. We show that an OU process driven by an infinite activity Gamma process, which is an OU-Gamma process, exhibits unique features, which allows one to explicitly describe and exactly sample from relevant joint distributions. This is a consequence of the OU structure and the calculus of Gamma and Dirichlet processes. We develop a particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for this type of continuous-time stochastic volatility models and check its performance using simulated data. For illustration we finally fit the model to S&P500 index data.","[James, Lancelot F.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Syst Business Stat & Operat Managem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mueller, Gernot] Augsburg Univ, Inst Math, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Zhang, Zhiyuan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"James, LF (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Syst Business Stat & Operat Managem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lancelot@ust.hk; gernot.mueller@math.uni-augsburg.de; zhang.zhiyuan@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,"grant RGC-HKUST of the HKSAR [601712]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301097, 71331006]",grant RGC-HKUST of the HKSAR; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Lancelot F.

The Malaysian government has set a target to retrofit 100 government buildings in order to contribute to the country's commitment to reduce the CO2 emissions intensity of gross domestic product by 45% by 2030. However, there is no specific sustainability assessment scheme targeted at building refurbishment in Malaysia. Thus, this research aims to support the development of a refurbishment sustainability assessment scheme for Malaysia. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was adopted in order to rank assessment themes and identify the priorities of the study's participating stakeholders. The outcome is the Malaysian Refurbishment Assessment Scheme (MRAS), which includes a set of weightings and a classification system for the selected assessment themes and sub themes.

Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, a soft computing technique for analyzing complex decision-making problems, is applied to identify the critical factors that will affect the large-scale production of bioethanol from biowaste. Results indicate that the different groups of stakeholders have a different perception and identify different factors as the driving forces of the project.

Using prior information contained in the network relationships, we model the covariance as a polynomial function of the symmetric adjacency matrix. Accordingly, the problem of estimating a high-dimensional covariance matrix is converted to one of estimating low dimensional coefficients of the polynomial regression function, which we can accomplish using ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood. The resulting covariance matrix estimator based on the maximum likelihood approach is guaranteed to be positive definite even in finite samples. Under mild conditions, we obtain the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators. A Bayesian information criterion is also developed to select the order of the polynomial function.

With multiple instruments, two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimand is a weighted average of different LATEs. What is often overlooked in the literature is that the postulated moment condition evaluated at the 2SLS estimand does not hold unless those LATEs are the same. If so, the conventional heteroscedasticity-robust variance estimator would be inconsistent, and 2SLS standard errors based on such estimators would be incorrect. I derive the correct asymptotic distribution, and propose a consistent asymptotic variance estimator by using the result of Hall and Inoue (2003, Journal of Econometrics) on misspecified moment condition models. This can be used to correctly calculate the standard errors regardless of whether there is more than one LATE or not.","[Lee, Seojeong] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",jay.lee@unsw.edu.au,"Lee, Seojeong/JJE-4091-2023","Lee, Seojeong/0000-0003-4382-5195",,,,,39,5,5,2,8,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, few empirical studies have gone deeper to explore specific psychological factors and their impacts on residents' acceptance of green labeled residential buildings (GLRBs). This study develops an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explain residents' intention to adopt GLRBs, and examine it in a survey (N = 342) conducted in Tianjin City, China. The results show that subjective knowledge about GLRBs, social trust in organizations responsible for GLRBs, perceived usefulness from GLRBs, attitude towards GLRBs, and general environmental attitude measured by the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, are the significant psychological determinants of intention to adopt GLRBs. It is also found that lacking subjective knowledge and social trust among our surveyed residents could be the psychological barriers to their acceptance of GLRBs. The psychological factors we identified provide references for policymakers to effectively develop residents' behavioral intervention strategies and allocate resources in GB promoting schemes. It is highly necessary to equip residents with more knowledge about GLRBs and improve their social trust in organizations responsible for delivering GLRBs.","[Liu, Yunxia; Liu, Peng] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Hong, Zaisheng; Zhu, Jie; Yan, Jingjing] Tianjin Univ, Res Inst Architectural Design & Urban Planning, 192 West Anshan Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Qi, Jianqiang] Sino Singapore Tianjin Ecocity, Green Bldg Res Inst, 2018 Zhongtian St, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",stefanie@tju.edu.cn; pengliu@tju.edu.cn,"Liu, Peng/AAT-6343-2020; Yan, Jingjing/Q-6426-2016","Liu, Peng/0000-0003-4929-0531;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71601139]; Seed Foundation of Tianjin University [2017XSC-0092],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Seed Foundation of Tianjin University,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project no. 71601139) and Seed Foundation of Tianjin University (Project no. 2017XSC-0092).

This situation is favourable for the growth of enterprise value and subsequent growth in demand and supply on a global, European and domestic (Slovak) scale. Investors in the international capital market finance their investment projects by equity and, in particular, debt, due to the current European cheap money policy. The value of investment projects (enterprises) financed by debt is higher due to the tax benefit of debt - tax shield. The existence of a tax shield is reflected, in addition to the company value, in both gross and net income and profitability ratios. International research lasting more than fifty years has provided several dozen methods, approaches and models to quantify the value (present value) of the tax shield or interest tax shield. The aim of this paper is to classify, compare and analyse selected methods of quantifying the value of the tax shield as a cash flow and to determine which of these methods are applicable globally and which models are subject to specific conditions. Fernandez (2006) algorithm was chosen as a suitable comparison procedure. In the end of the analysis, some of the advantages and drawbacks of generally applicable models, and the ways to solve these problems, such as the Circularity problem, are described.","[Michalkova, Lucia; Kovacova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Michalkova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",lucia.michalkova@fpedas.uniza.sk; maria.kovacova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Michalkova, Lucia/P-6098-2015; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015","Michalkova, Lucia/0000-0002-3072-7396;",VEGA [1/0428/17],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0428/17 CREATION OF NEW PARADIGMS OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AT THE THRESHOLD OF THE 21STCENTURY IN CONDITIONS OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC.,,24,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1715,1723,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300219,0

We measure these revenues against the total value of oil and gas produced in the top 16 oil- and gas-producing states using fiscal year 2013 as a benchmark. On average, state and local governments collect roughly 10% of oil and gas revenue, ranging from a low of roughly 1% to a high of nearly 40% (not including income taxes). We also assess the use of these revenues, finding that there is substantial variation among states. The largest shares of revenue flow to state governments' current expenditures and education, followed by local governments. Some states also allocate a portion of oil and gas revenues to trust funds endowing future government operations and/or education expenditures.","[Newell, Richard G.] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Raimi, Daniel] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Resources Future, 735 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Resources for the Future; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Raimi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Resources Future, 735 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",newell@rff.org; raimi@rff.org,"Raimi, Daniel/JFJ-3573-2023; Newell, Richard/I-3838-2015","Raimi, Daniel/0000-0002-9154-3371; Newell, Richard/0000-0002-3205-5562","Alfred P.

Solving the objectives of the proposed study is a contribution to the study of the problems of large migratory flows and problems arising from their ineffective regulation, and it also corresponds to the world and national priorities of science development. Based on the theories of migration, previously obtained results and new data, the new dynamic process simulation model of external migration flows in Ukraine will be created. The main factors, impact of which on the regulation of mobility in Ukraine will be evaluated not only qualitatively but also quantitatively are: the ratio of wages in Ukraine and recipient countries, differences in the level of GDP per capita, the possibility of purchase (rental) housing, differences in the level of marginal propensity to consume, etc. Based on the created simulation model, a scenario analysis is carried out and the main problems of the current regulation of migration flow existing in Ukraine are identified.","[Novik, Alina; Lukianenko, Iryna] Natl Univ Kyiv Mohyla Acad, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, 2 Skovorody Str, UA-04070 Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy,"Novik, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kyiv Mohyla Acad, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, 2 Skovorody Str, UA-04070 Kiev, Ukraine.",novikaj@ukma.edu.ua; iryna.lukianenko@ukma.edu.ua,"Lukianenko, Iryna/I-3725-2018","Lukianenko, Iryna/0000-0002-4128-5909",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,276,281,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300037,0

Using a longitudinal database of innovative publicly traded European companies between 1991 and 2008, the following main results arise. First, the elasticity of value added with respect to R&D is larger in regions characterized by a higher innovation performance (knowledge hubsversus industrial zones). Second, in knowledge hubs, industry affiliation mediates the gains from R&D: high-tech manufacturing firms profit more from R&D than low-tech ones. This evidence suggests that an innovative regional environment increases the capacity to translate R&D investments into productivity for European high-tech industries.

Con ayuda de una base de datos longitudinal de empresas europeas innovadoras de cotizacion oficial entre 1991 y 2008, surgen los siguientes resultados principales. En primer lugar, la elasticidad del valor anadido con respecto a I+D es mayor en las regiones que se caracterizan por un desempeno de innovacion superior (centros de conocimiento frente a zonas industriales). En segundo lugar, la afiliacion industrial en los centros de conocimiento sirve para mediar las ganancias de I+D: las empresas manufactureras de alta tecnologia se benefician mas de I+D que las de baja tecnologia. Esta evidencia indica que el entorno regional innovador aumenta la capacidad para traducir las inversiones de I+D en productividad para las industrias europeas de alta tecnologia. Este circulo virtuoso no funciona en el sector de servicios y en industrias manufactureras de baja tecnologia.","[Prenzel, Paula] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Int Business, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Birmingham Business Sch, City REDI Inst, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Cozza, Claudio] Ist Ric Serv Innovaz & Sistemi Complessi, AREA Sci Pk, Trieste, Italy; [Piva, Mariacristina] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Ortega-Argilés, R (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Strategy & Int Business, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Ortega-Argilés, R (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, City REDI Inst, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",p.v.prenzel@lse.ac.uk; r.ortegaargiles@bham.ac.uk; claudio.cozza@areasciencepark.it; mariacristina.piva@unicatt.it,"Cozza, Claudio/AAE-6091-2020; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020; Prenzel, Paula/U-3658-2019","Cozza, Claudio/0000-0001-7407-3497; Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; Prenzel, Paula/0000-0002-6490-125X; PIVA, Mariacristina/0000-0002-3347-8946",'Corporate R&D and Productivity: Econometric Tests Based on Microdata' Joint Research Centre-Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) project,'Corporate R&D and Productivity: Econometric Tests Based on Microdata' Joint Research Centre-Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) project,Financial support and data provision from the 'Corporate R&D and Productivity: Econometric Tests Based on Microdata' Joint Research Centre-Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) project are gratefully acknowledged.,,43,6,6,5,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Controlling is considered, in the context of globalization trends, to be a key tool by which enterprises can support their management system. However, it is necessary for the success of the implementation of controlling to the company, to respect the psychological aspects of the perception of controlling by the individual internal interest groups of the company. It is important for an enterprise to consider psychological factors that influence the perception and subsequent acceptance of controlling by employees of the company. The aim of the paper was to propose, based on the analysis of primary and secondary resources, a model of controlling implementation that will respect the psychological aspects affecting the perception of controlling by employees of the company. The given problem was investigated in Slovak business practice by a questionnaire. The main psychological factors that affect employees during the process of enforcing of controlling to the enterprise were identified from the results of the research.

This is a constantly discussed subject, both in professional circles and the public, as the professionalisation and internationalization of cyber criminals is a daily security threat to all the macroeconomic and microeconomic subjects of the world economy. Cyberspace is not restricted by the natural boundaries of states or continents, so the pfenomen of cybercrime in the current type of society has become a global problem. The starting point of the economic aspects of cyber crime is the analysis of the rational cyber criminal behavior model. It is decided on the basis of the expected costs and benefits of its activity, expressed in units of cash equivalent. The decision-making problem of cybercriminals is an optimization task with regard to its costs. Another discussed issue is the methods of combating cyber crime and a detailed analysis of the method of increased intensity of combat. It is based on reducing the number of cybercrime committed using the mechanism of increasing the cost of criminals.

The idea of the value chain describes an increase in value added within the individual phases of the production process, which includes the process from design to production and delivery of the product. One of the major markets in the Slovak Republic is the automotive industry, whose GVC is located in different parts of the world. An example is Volkswagen, which has major development and design centre located in Germany, with the assembly of many car models being implemented in Slovakia. The dominant aim of our article is to interpret the view of engagement and the position of the Slovak automotive industry in global value chains. Through the analysis, we focused on examining the effects of motor vehicle production on generating the value added in the home country and abroad. We have accentuated the value-added dimension by individual economic activities in the last stage of production and value added. We then compared the GVC with the V4 countries and Germany. Based on the comparison of selected economic indicators to the analysis of the participation index and the decomposition of Slovak exports, we determined the position of Slovakia and the automotive industry in GVC. Finally, we evaluate the results achieved and propose measures to improve Slovak participation in global value chains. The results show that Slovakia only engages in global value chains at lower levels of production. Proposals to support innovation could lead to a shift to higher positions.","[Sorokova, Tatiana] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Sci, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04011, Slovakia; [Petrikova, Daniela] Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Engn Educ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04011, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Soroková, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Sci, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04011, Slovakia.",tatiana.sorokova@tuke.sk; daniela.petrikova@tuke.sk,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1349,1357,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300173,0

We aim to answer the question, how different settings of the Slovak multi-pillar pension system affects the net transfers of currently living generations and future generations. The methodology applied is the framework of Generational Accounting. Since the reform in 2005, the Slovak pension system is based on a state operated first pillar and a private second pillar. The initial share of mandatory pension contributions assumed an allocation of fifty percent to the first and fifty percent to the second pillar. Total old age pension contributions are eighteen percent out of gross wage. Therefore, nine percent was transferred to the first and nine to the second pillar. Later this distribution was changed by a law expecting fourteen percent to the state run pillar and four percent to the private pillar. This law, however, expects gradual increase of contributions to the second pillar from four to six percent on the expense of the contributions to the first pillar. Another important feature of the Slovak pension system is the retirement age. It is currently determined taking into account the average life expectance. The entire increase of life expectance is translated into the working life. Our scenarios focus on two parameters of interest: (i) the share of mandatory contributions to the first and to the second pillar and (ii) changes of the retirement age.","[Tomas, Domonkos; Miroslava, Janosova] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Tomás, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Bratislava, Slovakia.",tomas.domonkos@savba.sk; miroslava.dolinajcova@savba.sk,"Janosova, Miroslava/AAC-8968-2019",,Slovak Research and Development Agency Grant [APVV-14-0787],Slovak Research and Development Agency Grant,This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency Grant APVV-14-0787.,,15,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1528,1535,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300195,0

In order to achieve the defined research goal, we briefly investigated theoretical concepts of M&A process in the global market, analyzed theoretical approaches to premium payments and reviewed contemporary research on motivation for paying high premiums. There are numerous potential motivations for mergers and acquisitions; however, the recent growth in M&A is mainly fostered by the need of consolidation of core business, growing competition and persistence of lower than historically average of oil prices. Other currently crucial motivations for M&As, especially in technology and pharmaceutical sectors, are converging technologies and expiration of patents (Fama, n.d.). The findings of the econometric analysis confirmed the positive relationship between the sizes of the premium paid and present value of forecasted synergies. Moreover, we determined the positive relationship between the premium and operating performance of the acquirer; leverage of the target. Size of the acquirer and target, debt load level of the acquirer, relative importance of the deal for acquirer were found to be negatively correlated to the size of the premium. Regarding the probability of overpayment, the findings of regression analysis suggest the existence of negative relationship between the share of stock and options in the total CEO consideration of the acquirer and probability of overpayment; negative relationship between the size of the target and probability of overpayment; positive correlation of probability of overpayment to the operating performance of the acquirer.","[Yurkov, Dmitiy; Kolesnikova, Julia; Zagidullin, Venera] Kazan Volga Reg Fed Univ, Kremlevskaya St 18, Kazan 420008, Russia; [Fakhrutdinov, Ruslan] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Sadovaya St 21, St Petersburg 191023, Russia",Kazan Federal University; Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Fakhrutdinov, R (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, Sadovaya St 21, St Petersburg 191023, Russia.",Hulia_K@mail.ru; venera408@yandex.ru,,,,,,,13,0,0,11,18,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1943,1950,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300248,0

We use the UK CPI data at the aggregate and sectoral level and find that the actual mean is about twice the theoretical minimum consistent with the observed frequency.

The existing literature on double regulation in an emissions trading system (ETS) context has largely focused on the direct type (when, e.g., an ETS and a carbon tax cover the same entity) and has not yet discussed the indirect type (when, e.g., the ETS and carbon tax cover two related entities in the same production-consumption chain). This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by identifying 'indirect double regulation' (ETS & tax) on the coal-fired generation in the EU and China. Specifically, we scrutinized legal documents associated with the coal-fired power and further presented the quantitative evidence of 'double carbon costs'. From the Law & Economics analysis of 'indirect double regulation', we derived implications of 'indirect double regulation' for the abatement of coal-fired power sector in its own jurisdiction and after a hypothetic linkage between the EU ETS and Chinese national ETS for its linked partner. In response, policy suggestions are provided to mitigate potential competitive distortions but should differentiate distortions by sources.","[Zeng, Yingying] Univ Groningen, Fac Law, Dept Law & Econ, Groningen, Netherlands; [Zeng, Yingying] United Nations Climate Change Bonn, Adaptat Programme, Impacts Vulnerabil & Risks Subprogramme, Bonn, Germany",University of Groningen,"Zeng, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Law, Dept Law & Econ, Groningen, Netherlands.;Zeng, YY (通讯作者)，United Nations Climate Change Bonn, Adaptat Programme, Impacts Vulnerabil & Risks Subprogramme, Bonn, Germany.",Y.Zeng@rug.nl,,,China Scholarship Council [201406010337],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The authors are deeply grateful to Dr. Stefan E.

When firms are equal and there is no cross-ownership, standards and taxes are equivalent and generate the same social welfare. However, under cross-ownership that result does not hold since cross-ownership reduces market competition, which has a different effect on taxes and standards.

Given the potential for solar photovoltaic energy to contribute to the energy mix in some countries, it is timely to carefully consider the potential environmental costs of operation of photovoltaic farms, which are experienced by the local population, while the general benefits accrue to all. We apply the contingent valuation method to a sample of local residents close to three selected photovoltaic farms in Portugal. Also, we design a discrete choice experiment to elicit the valuation of specific adverse impacts of electricity generation through photovoltaic energy by national residents. Our results show that the value elicited in the vicinity of the photovoltaic farms is non-negligible. On the other hand, national residents ponder the trade-offs implied by the choice sets and value positively the different adverse local impacts. Both of these estimates, in conjunction or independently, can be used to fully account for this often neglected cost of solar energy. Furthermore, we argue that when studying the public acceptance of renewables, using stated preference methods explicitly presents the trade-offs between negative impacts and costs, contributing to more realistic portrayal of public opinion.","[Botelho, Anabela] Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Botelho, Anabela] Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Lourenco-Gomes, Lina] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CETRAD, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Lourenco-Gomes, Lina] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, DESG, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Pinto, Ligia; Valente, Marieta] Univ Minho, EEG, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Pinto, Ligia; Valente, Marieta] Univ Minho, NIMA, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousad, Sara] Polytech Inst Coimbra, ISCAC, P-3040316 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Valente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, EEG, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Valente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, NIMA, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",anabela.botelho@ua.pt; lsofia@utad.pt; pintol@eeg.uminho.pt; ssousa@iscac.pt; mvalente@eeg.uminho.pt,"Sousa, Sara Rute Monteiro da Silva e/AED-1305-2022; Botelho, Anabela/JYQ-5409-2024; Valente, Marieta/J-8407-2016; Pinto, Lígia/AAC-3057-2019; Lourenço-Gomes, Lina/AAM-5288-2020; Pinto, Lígia/R-6430-2019","Sousa, Sara Rute Monteiro da Silva e/0000-0002-7489-7792; Valente, Marieta/0000-0003-3332-8945; Lourenço-Gomes, Lina/0000-0001-6509-1394; Pinto, Lígia/0000-0001-7089-2663; Botelho, Anabela/0000-0002-7042-5683",[PTDC/EGE-ECO/122402/2010]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/122402/2010] Funding Source: FCT,; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from PTDC/EGE-ECO/122402/2010.,,70,17,20,2,46,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,191,198,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.065,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400017,0

Furthermore, this study also discusses the differences between Korea and Japan and the event-based changes in the price premiums, namely, the appearance of Russia as a new supplier to Korea and Japan in April 2009, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011. The estimation results show that the appearance of a new supplier does not always lead to a decrease in the premium. In addition, LNG importers in Northeast Asia should pay attention to demand and supply in Europe as well as Asia because Northeast Asia and Europe share the same Middle Eastern exporting countries. Furthermore, Korea, Japan, and other Northeast countries need to establish close cooperation to enhance their negotiation power within the global LNG market.","[Choi, Gobong; Heo, Eunnyeong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Energy Syst Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Choi, G (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Energy Syst Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",gchoi0322@snu.ac.kr; heoe@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,9,9,0,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,676,684,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.033,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400066,0

This growth has resulted largely from Germany's feed-in tariff system. Recent changes in this policy, however, have made the previous REC business models mostly unprofitable, so RECs are looking for new business models. Our study aims at identifying those new models and characterizing the implementation barriers RECs face. To this end, we interviewed REC members and management and observed REC annual general meetings. We found three significant barriers: first, risk aversion on the part of both members and management; second, concerns about the environmental impacts or the ethics of certain models that, while legal, are not felt to align with the intentions of lawmakers; finally, the lack of competencies and time of the mostly unsalaried REC management. These barriers could put the future of RECs at risk, and so threaten the contributions RECs make to the German Energy Transition. Professionalization, partnerships and other strategies can help mitigate this risk. If RECs are to continue to play an important role in the energy transition, policy makers would be wise to consider measures to support their continued growth.","[Herbes, Carsten; Brummer, Vasco; Rognli, Judith] Nuertingen Geislingen Univ, Inst Int Res Sustainable Management & Renewable E, Neckarsteige 6-10, D-72622 Nuertingen, Germany; [Blazejewski, Susanne; Gericke, Naomi] Alanus Univ Arts & Social Sci, Chair Sustainable Org & Work Design, Villestr 3, D-53347 Alfter, Germany",Nuertingen-Geislingen University (NGU),"Herbes, C (通讯作者)，Nuertingen Geislingen Univ, Inst Int Res Sustainable Management & Renewable E, Neckarsteige 6-10, D-72622 Nuertingen, Germany.",carsten.herbes@hfwu.de; vasco.brummer@bfwu.de; judithrognli@gmail.com; susannne.blazejewski@alanus.de; naomi.gericke@posteo.de,"Herbes, Carsten/J-4566-2019","Herbes, Carsten/0000-0003-0670-8045","Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wiirttemberg in the BWPLUS program [BWE 13014]","Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wiirttemberg in the BWPLUS program","This work was supported by the Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wiirttemberg in the BWPLUS program (Grant number BWE 13014).",,81,87,94,3,60,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,82,95,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.051,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400009,0

Using panel data from fourteen countries between 2010 and 2015, we study impacts of seven factors in a multiple linear regression model. The factors include percentage of renewable energies in electricity generation, number of charging stations, education level, population density, gasoline price, GDP per capita and urbanization. The first four factors have apparent and positive impacts on the demands, and the last two factors don't. The gasoline price affects the demands for BEVs (battery electric vehicles) more than that for PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). One percent increase in renewables would lead to approximately 2-6% increase in EV demands. Based on the results, policy implications are discussed.","[Li, Xiaomin] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Chen, Pu] East China Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xingwu] Alfred Univ, Sch Engn, Alfred, NY 14802 USA",Henan University; East China Jiaotong University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Alfred University,"Wang, XW (通讯作者)，Alfred Univ, Sch Engn, Alfred, NY 14802 USA.",fwangx@alfred.edu,,", Chen/0000-0001-7594-6827; Li, Xiaomin/0000-0003-3008-6397","China Scholarship Council [201508410237]; Center for Collaborative Innovation Research on New Urbanization and CPEZ Construction, China [2017ZYFZ-118]; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Henan Province, China [2017BJJ018]; Training Program for Young Teachers of Higher Education in Henan Province, China [2016GGJS-215]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Center for Collaborative Innovation Research on New Urbanization and CPEZ Construction, China; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Henan Province, China; Training Program for Young Teachers of Higher Education in Henan Province, China","We are grateful to the editor and the anonymous referees for exceptionally helpful comments and suggestions.

Meanwhile, the major energy demand is distributed in the eastern region. Large scale of cross-regional electricity transmission is implemented to guarantee the power supply. The long distance electricity transmission (LDET) cost is an essential component of the final detail price. This paper proposes a new method to evaluate the real cost of LDET, which mainly focuses on the price mark-up between the electricity exporter and importer. A weighted least square regression model is applied to evaluate the influence of the factors that could impact the real operating cost of the LDET. Furthermore, we apply the LDET cost model to evaluate the synthesize cost of renewable energy, and find the current renewable policy of China is inefficient.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wei] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Wu, Wei/0000-0001-8613-3135",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [15ZD058],Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No: 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No: 1260-Y07200) and China National Social Science Fund (No: 15ZD058).",,30,32,36,7,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,132,140,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.055,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400013,0

Householders respond in different ways to IMD. Studies on aggregated water demand before and after IMD show a range of results from about 15% increased usage to 50% less. Little is known of the long-term durability of routine change. This article describes and qualitatively analyses the short- and long-term impacts of IMD on householders' water-use routines. A combination of time diaries, interviews, metering data and simple observations was used for the study of seven households. The households were studied at the introduction of IMD and after 5-17 months of experience; five of these households also participated in a follow-up study a decade later. The study shows that routines changed early, when households were informed about the new option that IMD provided and when getting billed. The routines were kept over time. Later changes in water usage related to changes in household composition and everyday activities and were not attributable to IMD. Implementers of IMD are advised to be careful in the introduction phase, e.g. when constructing debiting norms, performing information activities, and giving other feedback to the households.","[Kohler, Helena] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Köhler, H (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Environm Change, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",helena.kohler@liu.se,,,Swedish Research Council Formas [2008-1335],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council Formas [Grant number 2008-1335].

Within the UK there is concern that a future lack of water will compromise the UK's current energy policy to meet an increasing demand for electricity by more thermal generation. This paper investigates this by modelling the water demand of the UK's thermal generation in 2030 and 2050 for several future electricity generation pathways. Unlike previous studies this paper has obtained water abstraction and consumption figures specific to the UK. While the water demands were heavily pathway dependent this study finds for the thermal generation pathways there is a serious mismatch between the assumed freshwater available at 2030 and 2050, its expected actual availability, and an understanding of the implications this has for future generation costs. It is shown that a solution is to make greater use of the UK's seawater resource. This study finds the emphasis UK energy policy gives to the competing poles of low cost electricity generation and environmental protection will have significant impacts on the cost and make-up of the UK's future electricity generation portfolio. A companion paper will consider the generation cost issues if seawater is not available.","[Murrant, Daniel; Quinn, Andrew] Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Chapman, Lee] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Heaton, Chris] Inst Energy Technol, Loughborough LE11 3UZ, Leics, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Murrant, D (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.murrant@bham.ac.uk,"chapman, lee/AAE-8287-2020; Quinn, Andrew/B-7793-2008","chapman, lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Quinn, Andrew/0000-0003-0254-4661",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Energy Technologies Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1401259] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Energy Technologies Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Energy Technologies Institute.

The MCMV is the Brazilian government's housing program that gives access to home ownership to low-income Brazilians in urban and rural areas. Such analysis was undertaken by the evaluation of the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR), considering a Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR) and by varying the annual growth of energy tariffs over 25 years of operation, which represents the expected lifespan of solar panels. These two cities were chosen because their federal states have different actions with respect to tax matters. Such difference, in particular, will be examined and explored in this article.

In particular, the electricity consumption with the average annual growth rate of 7.24% has been increasing considerably over the past two decades. In step with the changes in the world electricity industry, initial steps towards restructuring in Iran's electricity industry were taken during the 1990s, resulting in the launching of Iranian wholesale electricity market in November 2003. Achieving long-term security of supply, clarification of the electricity price and the attraction of the private investments are some of the main goals of the electricity industry restructuring in Iran. The privatization and breaking of the governmental monopoly was officially started in 2000 with the beginning of the third development plan, which led to the 48.05% contribution of the private sector in the annual energy generation in 2015. This paper investigates the process of restructuring in Iranian electricity industry comprehensively.

There also appears to be consensus on the kinds of changes that may possible for the future, even though there may be disagreement over the exact mix of technologies and policies needed to increase sustainability or mitigate climate change. The terms transition and transformation have both been used to denote the type of change needed in large socio-technical systems. However, the terms have been used both in contradiction of each other and synonymously by different authors. A comprehensive review of both theory and usage in scientific publications was conducted to determine if the terms have been used to denote fundamentally different concepts and if the concept of change is framed differently by usage so as to affect understanding. Despite two camps being readily identifiable, it was concluded that the terms generally refer to the same fundamental concept. At the same time, framing of the concept can be viewed as somewhat different, resulting in a potential for confusion on the part of the reader that may detract from achieving the outcome of change. It is suggested that change to physical forms and systems be denoted as transformations, and that changes to large socio-technical systems be denoted as transitions when the focus is on a higher order of change that highlights the ways that society motivates, facilitates, and benefits from change.","[Child, Michael; Breyer, Christian] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Child, M (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland.",Michael.Child@lut.fi,"Breyer, Christian/W-2106-2018","Breyer, Christian/0000-0002-7380-1816","public financing of Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [40101/14]; public financing of Tekes","public financing of Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation; public financing of Tekes","The authors gratefully acknowledge the public financing of Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, for the 'Neo-Carbon Energy' project under the number 40101/14.",,65,26,30,2,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,11,26,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.022,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200002,0

The endogeneities of income and saving rise can increase the uncertain part of private discount rate up to a higher estimated subjective social discount rate about 14.46% for urban or 8.86% for peri-urban environmental infrastructures improvement.

Additionally, other housing problems such as damp are common. Previous research has found a link between housing problems and poor health and reduced well-being, but this relationship is complex and poorly understood. A survey among UK social housing residents (N=536) investigated the association between cold and damp housing, as well as the role of energy affordability concerns in the relationship between housing problems and health. The findings indicated that struggles, with keeping warm related to a cluster of damp and mould issues rather than any one specific issue. In describing these problems householders expressed a sense of frustration and helplessness. Support was found for an indirect effect on health whereby households experiencing cold, damp or mould issues reported more difficulty with affording their energy bills, these affordability concerns in turn related to poor health and well-being. The effects were found to be more consistent and stronger for men compared to women. Policies aimed at reducing housing problems should consider the important role of affordability concerns and the need for households to regain control of their energy bills.","[Boomsma, Christine; Pahl, Sabine] Plymouth Univ, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Jones, Rory V.; Fuertes, Alba] Plymouth Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Environm, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth,"Boomsma, C (通讯作者)，Plymouth Univ, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",christine.boomsma@plymouth.ac.uk; sabine.pahl@plymouth.ac.uk; rory.jones@plymouth.ac.uk; alba.fuertes@plymouth.ac.uk,"Pahl, Sabine/AAT-1829-2021","Jones, Rory/0000-0002-2716-9872; Fuertes, Alba/0000-0002-6224-1489; Boomsma, Christine/0000-0002-0576-7652",European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [649673]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649673] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),The research reported in this paper was undertaken as part of the EnerGAware project: Energy Game for Awareness of energy efficiency in social housing communities.

MNEs are attracted by positive externalities provided by the large agglomerations. Additionally, Vietnam introduced an open-door policy with the initiation of the transition process in 1986. The question arises of whether MNEs will contribute to a regional increase or decrease in the spatial concentration of economic activities. In short, the paper analyzes the locational pattern of MNEs and their spatial impact. Since the economic transition to a socialist-oriented market economy in 1986, a large inflow of FDI has come mainly to the two most important economic regions in Vietnam, namely the Red River Delta (RRD) and the Southeast. Historically, the business climate in the Southeast is more market-oriented, whereas the socialist heritage of the planning system is stronger in the RRD. At first sight, industry in the RRD is less highly concentrated compared to the Southeast because MNEs try to avoid the locations with socialist remains. However, by means of an analysis using the continuous spatial concentration index, we detect that industrial production is also becoming more concentrated in the RRD.","[Thi Xuan Thu Nguyen; Diez, Javier Revilla] Univ Cologne, Geog Inst, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Diez, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Geog Inst, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",nxthu85@gmail.com; j.revilladiez@uni-koeln.de,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380",,,,,63,14,14,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

It first presents a conceptual framework synthesized from the business studies, entrepreneurship, evolutionary economics, innovation studies, management science, organization studies, political science, and sociology literature. This framework suggests that corporate approaches to clean technology innovation will cut across the four dimensions of organizational multiplicity and stakeholder involvement, information sharing, coordination and control, and market orientation. It then explores how eight firms the Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship and Aurora Algae (biofuel), DONG and Statoil (carbon capture and storage), Tesla and Volkswagen (electric vehicles), and Siemens and Vestas (offshore wind turbines) approach clean technology development with open innovation attributes mixed with closed attributes. Although the study finds striking similarities among the particular approaches embraced by each corporate actor, it also notes that approaches are technology and firm specific, and the potential for different permutations leads to an almost endless number of possible stylistic combinations. The innovation profiles depicted also reveal conflict and competition among various stakeholders, the implication being that corporate innovation in the energy sector remains a conflicted, disjointed, and messy process.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Jeppesen, Jakob; Bandsholm, Jesper; Asmussen, Joakim; Balachandran, Rakulan; Vestergaard, Simon; Andersen, Thomas Hauerslev; Sorensen, Thomas Klode; Bjorn-Thygesen, Frans] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Aarhus University; University of Sussex,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",BenjaminSo@hih.au.dk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant [EP/K011790/1]; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant [4182-00033B]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant; Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors are appreciative to the Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant EP/K011790/1 and the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF) Sapere Aude Grant 4182-00033B, which have supported elements of the work reported here.

In Europe, the 2030 Energy and Climate Package asks for further reductions of green house gases, renewable sources integration, and energy efficiency targets. But the polluting intensity of electricity may be different in average than when considering market inefficiencies, in particular losses, and therefore the implemented policy must take those differences into account. Precisely, herein we study the importance in terms of CO2 emissions the extra amount of energy necessary to cover losses. With this purpose we use Spanish market and system data with hourly frequency from 2011 to 2013. Our results show that indeed electricity losses significantly explain CO2 emissions, with a higher CO2 emissions rate when covering losses than the average rate of the system. Additionally, we find that the market closing technologies used to cover losses have a positive and significant impact on CO2 emissions: when polluting technologies (coal or combined cycle) close the market, the impact of losses on CO2 emissions is high compared to the rest of technologies (combined heat and power, renewables or hydropower). To the light of these results we make some policy recommendations to reduce the impact of losses on CO2 emissions.","[Davi-Arderius, Daniel] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Chair Energy Sustainabil, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanin, Maria-Eugenia] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, EPEE, Evry, France; [Trujillo-Baute, Elisa] Univ Barcelona Univ Warwick & Barcelona Inst Econ, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universite Paris Saclay,"Daví-Arderius, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, Chair Energy Sustainabil, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",daniel_davi@yahoo.es,"Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/P-2285-2019; Davi-Arderius, Daniel/AEH-3400-2022","Trujillo-Baute, Elisa/0000-0002-6328-3242; Davi-Arderius, Daniel/0000-0003-2889-1485","Chair of Energy Sustainability (Barcelona Institute of Economics, University of Barcelona); Generalitat de Catalunya SGR [2015-SGR531]; Spanish Ministry of Economy [ECO2015-69107-R]; FUNSEAM (Foundation for Energy and Environment Sustainability)","Chair of Energy Sustainability (Barcelona Institute of Economics, University of Barcelona); Generalitat de Catalunya SGR; Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government); FUNSEAM (Foundation for Energy and Environment Sustainability)","We are grateful for the generous support of the Chair of Energy Sustainability (Barcelona Institute of Economics, University of Barcelona), and the Generalitat de Catalunya SGR project 2015-SGR531.

Regime shifts are uncertain and lead to structural changes in the system dynamics, lowering the carrying capacity of the resource. Optimal management is driven by two considerations. First, it becomes precautionary if a higher stock of the renewable resource decreases the hazard of a regime shift. Second, it either becomes precautionary or more aggressive depending on the adjustments that are needed after the regime shift. This in turn depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. In conclusion, facing the risk of a regime shift in the ecological system, optimal management is ambiguous but precautionary if the marginal hazard rate of the regime shift is sufficiently high.

The analysis has been carried out using the Malmquist Index and natural and managerial efficiency. Three variables have been considered as inputs: work, gross fixed capital formation and final energy consumption. Two variables are the outputs: the GDP as a desirable output and greenhouse effect gas emissions as an undesirable output. The result is that Spain's managerial efficiency and natural efficiency are, though their values are lower, evolving in a similar manner to those of the countries which have been at the heart of the EU longer. These levels of efficiency are higher than those of the block of countries which have joined the EU-28 more recently. The natural Malmquist Index results indicate that these are the countries which have had a greater growth in productivity, above Spain's and the average of the more veteran countries.","[Teresa Sanz-Diaz, Maria; Yniguez, Rocio] Univ Seville, Dept Anal Econ & Econ Polit, Fac Econ & Empresariales, Seville, Spain; [Velasco-Morente, Francisco] Univ Seville, Dept Econ Aplicada 1, Fac Econ & Empresariales, Seville, Spain; [Diaz-Calleja, Emilio] Univ Seville, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Fac Econ & Empresariales, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Sanz-Díaz, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Anal Econ & Econ Polit, Fac Econ & Empresariales, Seville, Spain.",,"Velasco-Morente, Francisco/E-6301-2010; YÑIGUEZ, ROCIO/E-6838-2010; Sanz-Diaz, Teresa/F-4282-2017","Velasco-Morente, Francisco/0000-0002-9585-1208; YÑIGUEZ, ROCIO/0000-0002-7370-6632; , Emilio Diaz-Calleja/0000-0003-1644-6923; Sanz-Diaz, Teresa/0000-0002-2403-8447","Andalusian Regional Government [SEJ-132]; Roger Tome Foundation through the Energy and Environmental Economics Chair at the University of Seville; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-56399-R]; Project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, HERMES [TIN2013-46801-C4-1-r]; Simon [P11-TIC-8052]","Andalusian Regional Government; Roger Tome Foundation through the Energy and Environmental Economics Chair at the University of Seville; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, HERMES; Simon","The first and the third authors wish to acknowledge the funding provided by the following institutions: the Andalusian Regional Government (project SEJ-132), the Roger Tome Foundation through the Energy and Environmental Economics Chair at the University of Seville and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2014-56399-R Project).; The second author wish to acknowledge the funding provided by the Project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, HERMES (TIN2013-46801-C4-1-r), Simon (P11-TIC-8052).",,66,19,19,0,43,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,183,193,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.030,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500018,0

Our framework is that of a predictive regression model with threshold effects and our goal is to develop operational and easily implementable inferences when one does not wish to impose a priori restrictions on the parameters of the model other than the slopes corresponding to the persistent predictor. Differently put our tests for the null hypothesis of no predictability against threshold predictability remain valid without the need to know whether the remaining parameters of the model are characterized by threshold effects or not (e.g., shifting versus nonshifting intercepts). One interesting feature of our setting is that our test statistics remain unaffected by whether some nuisance parameters are identified or not. We subsequently apply our methodology to the predictability of aggregate stock returns with valuation ratios and document a robust countercyclicality in the ability of some valuation ratios to predict returns in addition to highlighting a strong sensitivity of predictability based results to the time period under consideration.","[Gonzalo, Jesus] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Pitarakis, Jean-Yves] Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Southampton,"Gonzalo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain.",jesus.gonzalo@uc3m.es; jp10@soton.ac.uk,"GONZALO, JESUS/C-3276-2011","GONZALO, JESUS/0000-0002-4309-5025; Pitarakis, Jean-Yves/0000-0002-6305-7421","Spanish MINECO [ECO2013-46395, MDM 2014-0431]; Bank of Spain; MadEco-CM [S2015/HUM-3444]; ESRC [RES-000-22-3983]; ESRC [ES/H032533/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H032533/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); Bank of Spain; MadEco-CM; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank seminar participants at the University of Nottingham, Cambridge University, Durham University, LSE, Surrey University, Barcelona GSE, ES-SEC Paris, Oxford University, the ESEM 2014 meetings in Toulouse, the 2014 IAAE conference at Queen Mary and the ENSAI for their comments.

It argues that this leads to greater price dispersion, causing some consumers to be discriminated against. It analyses price data for the UK Internet motor insurance market, collecting data on 32,255 prices for 110 sub-markets, where differences in price dispersion across these by age, occupation and sex of the driver are argued to reflect differences in search ability. Allowing for price dispersion to also depend on the insurance risk, it finds greater price dispersion for consumers with weaker search abilities, i.e. older, unemployed, retired or female consumers. As this is not explained by alternative hypotheses, the paper concludes that improved Internet access alone will not close the 'digital divide'. The implication is that policymakers should address the online search abilities of individuals as well as Internet access.","[McDonald, Stephen; Wren, Colin] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"McDonald, S (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Econ, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",stephen.mcdonald@ncl.ac.uk; colin.wren@ncl.ac.uk,"McDonald, Stephen/G-4010-2013","McDonald, Stephen/0000-0001-6103-1386",,,,,33,7,7,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

This paper attempts to assess the public's additional willingness to pay (WTP) for substituting consumption of a unit of electricity generated from nuclear power plant, currently a dominant power generation source in Korea, with that produced from NG-based CHP plant in terms of decentralized generation using the contingent valuation (CV) method. To this end, a CV survey of 1,000 households was implemented. The results show that the mean additional WTP for substituting nuclear power plant by NG-based CHP plant is estimated to be KRW 55.3 (USD 0.047) per kWh of electricity, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. This value amounts to 44.7% of the average price for electricity, KRW 123.69 (USD 0.106) in 2015, which implies that the public are ready to shoulder a significant financial burden to achieve the substitution. Moreover, the value can be interpreted as an external cost of nuclear power generation relative to NG-based CHP generation, or as an external benefit of NGbased CHP generation relative to nuclear power generation with a view to decentralized generation.","[Kim, Hyo-Jin; Lim, Seul-Ye; Yoo, Seung-Hoon] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Dept Energy Policy, 232 Gongreung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Yoo, SH (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Dept Energy Policy, 232 Gongreung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",hyojinkim@seoultech.ac.kr; sylim@seoultech.ac.kr; shyoo@seoultech.ac.kr,"Yoo, Seung-Hoon/F-1048-2010","Yoo, Seung-Hoon/0000-0001-5048-219X","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea [20164030201060]","Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea","This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20164030201060).",,32,17,17,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,125,131,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.044,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200013,0

The SNWTP was originally conceived out of a special view of human-environment relations so different from the logics of the demand-supply equilibrium. The project was promoted by the post-Mao regime as a means to cope with economic downturn. Its challenges to existing institutions should not be overstated out of its political proportion. Its detrimental environmental impacts are not surprising enough to justify alternatives. The SNWTP provides an interesting case with which to understand the sophisticated interrelationship between water infrastructure, technology, society and environment.","[Lin, George C.

In order to assess the impact of domestic policy priorities on bilateral energy cooperation and climate policy, this comparative study traces the evolution of EU and Chinese approaches to energy policy - and their relative emphasis on factors and frames such as availability, efficiency, affordability and environmental stewardship. Drawing on government documents and a data set of interviews with Chinese policy-makers, experts and academics in 2015-2016, the article argues that while the EU started with a strong emphasis on environmental stewardship and moved towards a focus on affordability and availability, China started with a strong emphasis on availability and has moved towards a greater emphasis on environmental stewardship. This shift in frames on the Chinese side and subsequent changes in subsidy structures and targets can partially explain the increase in investments in renewable energy technologies. The article concludes that the Chinese and EU perspectives have become more aligned over the past ten years, coinciding with an increasing trend towards renewable energy in Chinese energy investments in the EU, for example in Italy and the UK.

Europe has lured 60% of the total USD 27.3 billion invested by Chinese SWFs in the energy sector globally, which provokes the question as to how important SWF investments are in the political sense and what security concerns they bring. This paper is the first that presents a comprehensive picture of Chinese SWF investments in the European energy market and one of the very few papers about SWFs based on multiannual, comprehensive empirical data. The author argues that Chinese SWFs are different players on the energy market than private investors, could be potentially harmful for some European interests. By installing representatives on the company boards, China gains access to sensitive information that could be then transferred to Chinese competitors. Moreover, through its SWFs China could take control over energy companies or critical infrastructure and increase its political influence in European countries, making them more vulnerable to political pressure. Therefore, the European policy-makers should consider taking special steps to monitor and maybe limit Chinese SWFs expansion in the energy sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The two policies have a similar objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the policies differ in the manner in which those objectives are met. The RFS imposes a hierarchical mandate of renewable fuel use for each year whereas the LCFS imposes a specific annual carbon intensity reduction with less of a fuel specific mandate. We model the interactions using a partial-equilibrium structural model of agricultural and energy markets in the US and Rest-of-World regions. Our results suggest the policies are mutually reinforcing in that the compliance costs of meeting one of the requirements is lower in the presence of the other policy.

Such kind of behaviour is also required within the capital budgeting that continues many-sided activities. Its important part is the assessing a profit potential of projects, taking into consideration time value of money, risks, alternative investments, and future opportunities. Risk of project CF is generally calculated in valuating of investments in the form of a risk premium added to the risk-free rate of return (starting point of the component of the discount rate, by which expected CF is converted to its present value). Searching for the risk premium is often associated with more or less problems of determination, therefore alternative options to delegate risks into the project appraisal are being searched. In keeping with the principle of risk equivalence between anticipated CF and discount rate, as an alternative of the risk premium is possible to choose to discount CF by the risk-free discount rate, while the risk will be reflected directly in the predicted (excepted) CF, which is the basis of so-called certainty equivalents method. In the context of this, the method of certainty equivalents at the theoretical level will be presented, referring to possibilities of its use in a practise of companies within their capital budgeting whether at the domestic or at international level.","[Achimska, Veronika; Kramarova, Katarina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Achimská, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",veronika.achimska@fpedas.uniza.sk; katarina.kramarova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kramarova, Katarina/P-2705-2015","Kramarova, Katarina/0000-0001-6883-3541",,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,15,20,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059200003,0

He also had a significant presence in Latin America, where he became an outstanding popularizer of political economy, especially in the Republic of Chile. Indeed, this work analyses the articles written by de Mora in El Mercurio de Chile (1828-1829), which were intellectually indebted to classical political economy, in particular, to Smith-McCulloch's theory of economic growth, and embedded as a whole a complete institutional reform and an economic agenda that promoted the foundation of commercial banks, the introduction of direct taxation, public debt issuing and free trade. These Chilean articles give a new account of de Mora's work on political economy, showing how he combined common doctrinal background and proposals of reform and policies with a modernized rhetoric over the course of almost three decades.","[Astigarraga, Jesus] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Zabalza, Juan] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universitat d'Alacant,"Astigarraga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,,,,,,,60,1,1,0,3,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

This is going against common knowledge that small and medium enterprises are usually considered as drivers force for innovation. Common obstacle for innovation stated by firms is the lack of finances. In this light, it seems that organizational innovation can be the way for improving market position, increasing effectiveness and effectivity and for creating better culture in firms. There are still imperfections in current models of managing organization such as lack of stakeholder's internal motivation, missing leaders and moral authorities, low capability to accept responsibility or small coherence in firms. Paper focuses on small and medium enterprises approach to organizational innovation in civil engineering industry. This industry can be considered as one of the most non-transparent industry in the Czech Republic. It can be connected to instability of civil engineering industry coming from strong dependency on economic cycle and public investment. Building coherence, trust and loyalty in firm is more challenging in this segment.

The main economic mechanisms of protection from pension risks with the purpose of improving the citizens quality of life were analyzed. The analysis of existing economic mechanisms of protection from pension risks in the territory of Russia made it possible to identify key problems, in particular low pension literacy of the population and distrust of specialized financial institutions; investment policy of the regions, which does not take into account the possibility of raising funds from non-state pension funds in regional projects; lack of a mechanism to support regional Non-state Pensions Funds (NAPFs). The study allowed to identify the main areas of protection from pension risks.

Regional Studies. This paper advances current debates on relational regions and higher education through a unique focus on the rise of transregional university alliances. It examines the formation of university research and training consortia to make a series of wider arguments about the new spatialities of higher education praxis, the construction of new regional identities and processes of institutionalizing relational regions. Our research shows new partnership working between universities to be conducive to the weakening of fixed regional territories. The paper then illustrates how and why some relational imaginaries are beginning to crystallize into harder institutional forms, before revealing significant political-economic and societal implications arising from new institutional geographies of higher education. Furthermore, our research reveals the concerted theoretical and empirical attention required to develop vocabulary and frameworks better able to comprehend emergent regional worlds. For our part, we distinguish between territorial, archipelagic, de facto and constellatory regionalism to exact more precise interpretations of unfolding configurations of relational regions and a new conceptual perspective on the increasingly complex spatialities characterizing and shaping our globalizing world.","[Harrison, John; Smith, Darren P.; Kinton, Chloe] Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Polit & Geog Sci, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Harrison, J (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Polit & Geog Sci, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England.",j.harrison4@lboro.ac.uk; d.p.smith@lboro.ac.uk; c.kinton2@lboro.ac.uk,"Harrison, John/D-1485-2010","Smith, Darren P/0000-0003-0775-1221; Harrison, John/0000-0002-6434-5142",Loughborough University Enterprise Office,Loughborough University Enterprise Office,The authors are also grateful to the Loughborough University Enterprise Office for financial support through the Enterprise Project Group (EPG) and Higher Education Innovation Fund.,,37,20,20,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The liberalization of markets has caused an extreme increase in transport performance, which is linked to an increase in static transport in cities as well. In particular, parking areas for heavy freight vehicles in city areas cause problems connected, for example, with insufficient capacity or inadequate equipment. In the Czech Republic the regional concepts for the location of parking lots for trucks have not been developed - rest areas are built mainly on highways. Drivers are forced into other roads to search for alternative parking places and thus jeopardize the safety of the cargo to be transported. Because of the lack of such parking places, drivers are forced to violate the European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport (AETR) or, due to this agreement, to park the truck before the driver's work shift ends, thereby reducing the efficiency of full driver usage. The paper deals with the issue of rest areas location for road freight vehicles in the selected area. The first part of the paper characterizes variant solutions of parking areas in a particular selected area, which were evaluated on the basis of an analysis of the current conditions. The second part of the paper introduces the evaluation of individual variants using the TOPSIS method, which was chosen as the most appropriate method of multicriteria decision making process.","[Lizbetin, Jan; Bartuska, Ladislav] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Technol, Dept Transport & Logist, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Lizbetin, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Technol, Dept Transport & Logist, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",lizbetin@mail.vstecb.cz; bartuska@mail.vstecb.cz,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1339,1346,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202038,0

In this, a consumption-based emissions inventory approach is applied. The analysis is based on an environmentally-extended input-output model including direct CO2 emissions from households, indirect CO2 emissions from electricity consumption and indirect CO2 emissions from energy used in the production of goods and services purchased by households, domestic or imported. Statistical analysis and appropriate regression models were developed in order to identify the main factors influencing the carbon footprint of Greek households. The results indicate that the observed trends during the period 1995-2008 can be attributed to the effect of high economic growth. This trend is partially counterbalanced by favorable weather conditions and the implementation of greenhouse mitigation policies and measures mainly in the supply side. Since 2008 the shrinking household income is the dominant driver. In addition, the effectiveness of energy conservation policies and measures in place is rather low, while the effect of imports is limited.","[Markaki, M.; Belegri-Roboli, A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Fac Appl Math & Phys, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece; [Sarafidis, Y.; Mirasgedis, S.] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Palea Penteli 15236, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Observatory of Athens,"Mirasgedis, S (通讯作者)，Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Palea Penteli 15236, Greece.",seba@noa.gr,"Mirasgedis, Sebastian/ABC-5691-2021; Markaki, Maria/AAD-6076-2019","Markaki, Maria/0000-0002-9537-9660",,,,,44,42,44,3,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,206,215,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.031,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900020,0

Regional Studies. This paper describes changing commuting patterns within rural regions gradually integrated into metropolitan dynamics and recently reconfigured by state rescaling processes. It focuses on Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), a rural region under Madrilenian influence, between 1981 and 2011. The empirical results show that these regions are (1) becoming hybrid territories, changing from predominantly rural territories into areas that exhibit mixed rural-metropolitan behaviours; (2) increasingly influenced by metropolitan overflows, which are predominantly integrating non-centrality municipalities; (3) transforming their urban spatial structures from leaderless models to incipient polycentric ones; and (4) experiencing a commuting reconfiguration towards multidirectional patterns.","[Mohino, Inmaculada; Solis, Eloy; Urena, Jose M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Civil Engn, Avda Carlos 3,S-N,Edificio 21, E-45071 Toledo, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Mohíno, I (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Civil Engn, Avda Carlos 3,S-N,Edificio 21, E-45071 Toledo, Spain.",inmaculada.mohino@uclm.es; eloy.solis@uclm.es; josemaria.unena@uclm.es,"SOLIS, ELOY/M-3079-2019; Mohino, Inmaculada/AAB-2390-2019; Solis, Eloy/C-7715-2011; Urena Frances, Jose Maria/R-3434-2017","SOLIS, ELOY/0000-0003-2950-730X; Mohino, Inmaculada/0000-0001-5751-2507; Urena Frances, Jose Maria/0000-0002-0404-1454",Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) Regional Research Plan [PPII10-0048-643]; Spanish National Research Plan [TRA2011-28465-C03-01]; Spanish Teaching Fellowship Program [FPU12/01535],Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) Regional Research Plan; Spanish National Research Plan(Spanish Government); Spanish Teaching Fellowship Program,"The authors appreciate greatly the economic support given by the Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) Regional Research Plan [grant number PPII10-0048-643], the Spanish National Research Plan [grant number TRA2011-28465-C03-01], and the Spanish Teaching Fellowship Program [grant number FPU12/01535].",,63,13,14,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Globalization is viewed as a consistent but controversial worldwide process of increasing interdependence between the socio-economic systems of different countries in conditions of ever-deepening international division of labor. The analysis is carried out from the point of view of interaction of globalization with integral properties of socio-economic systems, including: the property of their integrity, the consequence of violation of which is formation of systems with inefficient oligarchic structure in the world economy; the property of uncertainty of basic quantitative features, playing the special role in development of transformation systems, for which the reduction in degree of this uncertainty in global economy is vital; poorly studied property of self-similarity (fractality) of socio-economic systems, consisting in formation of stable basic characteristics of the system, invariant with respect to any transformations, and inevitably reproduced at all stages of world development, although in other specific historical forms. Attention is paid to the fact that the interaction analyzed plays the key role in dynamics of global processes, direction and forms of their further implementation. The contradictions arising in the process of the named interaction are identified and analyzed. The purpose of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of globalization and to identify possible limits of its positive impact on development of socioeconomic systems.

Regional Studies. This paper studies what affects the volatility of sub-central public spending in 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The evidence based on data from 1972 to 2007 shows that the volatility of intergovernmental grants from upper levels is positively associated with the volatility of local expenditure. On the other hand, the volatility of local tax revenues - mainly that of property taxes - exerts the opposite effect. These findings suggest that making local governments rely more on grants than own tax revenues adversely affects their spending stability. Allowing them to levy autonomously taxes relying on responsive tax bases provides incentives to smooth their expenditure.","[Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Mercatorum, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Governance & Econ Res Network, Madrid, Spain; [Salotti, Simone] European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain",Universita Telematica Mercatorum; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Salotti, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain.",a.sacchi@unimercatorum.it; simone.salotti@ec.europa,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683",,,,,91,12,12,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Due to the significant impact they have on the development level of a country, these major population centres, are now competing with each other, sometimes at international levels, to attract investments and knowledge workers at the time they are facing social challenges. As a result, many governments in cities are currently initiating Smart City (SC) projects with the aim of addressing the rapid urbanization's issues, but with little agreement on what the SC concept actually represents and the way in which it should be implemented. In this context, citizens, who are supposed to be key players in this global change process, remain at times reluctant, at times foreign to it. This research paper analyses citizens' knowledge on the concept of SC and the four basic elements of what it is composed. In order to address this purpose, a self-administered questionnaire was conducted with a sample of individuals in Northwest Spain. Findings support this previous premise: citizens show a lack of awareness of the concept and the role of its main dimensions, apart from a poor involvement in public SC projects.

In this situation, the international exchange of ideas and the development of integrated solutions can provide an essential basis for the development of innovative solutions. The transport planning executed by the transportation companies is known to be one-sided.

The first objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of using existing secondary data sources as a basis for sub-nation state and regional analysis (with the regions in this case differentiating the area based on rurality). The second was to structure the outputs of the analysis in ways that provided comprehensive yet succinct and interpretable assessments of the balance of flows of material, energy and money that underpin the economy, with the intention that ultimately these assessments would be used to inform policymaking. The paper provides an introduction to the key concepts used within social metabolism analysis particularly the use of emergy (a measure of the cumulative environmental support provided to a social-ecological system). This is a unifying metric into which the myriad flows within an economy can be translated and combined in meaningful ways. It does so by, preserving information on both the quantity and quality of flows and so avoiding the need for arbitrary weightings. The paper presents a range of options for the use of emergy-based metrics that could be used to inform policy making. Comparisons for the years 2001 and 2010 are made at country level for Scotland and for three degrees of rurality. The analysis highlights how decisions on the share of the offshore energy sector attributed to Scotland and on the share of services (particularly those imported from beyond U.K.) have profound effects on the sustainability trajectory of the economy and the conclusions that might be drawn for policy. The paper concludes that the methods have the potential to add value to existing administrative datasets, and provide new perspectives that may be of value to policy making, but acknowledges that challenges remain in translating this potential into tangible use within policymaking.","[Viglia, S.; Ulgiati, S.] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, Ctr Direz Isola C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy; [Matthews, K.

Additionally, high current account deficits stemming from energy import dependency make substitution of fossil energy with renewable energy a necessity for Turkey. Although Turkey has a great potential in terms of renewable energy, it has not begun to utilize this great potential until recent years. However, Turkey has many motives to utilize renewable energy further. This paper aims to investigate whether renewable energy consumption raises GDP in Turkey. For this purpose, the paper uses data spanning the period 1990-2015 and employs cointegration and causality tests which can present efficient output in small samples. The findings indicate that GDP is not related to renewable energy consumption and there is no causality between GDP and renewable energy consumption in Turkey. In conclusion, the paper argues that these findings may stem from the low share of renewable energy in total energy and Turkey needs to utilize renewable energy sources further to (i) meet energy needs for economic activities, (ii) mitigate environmental problems, and (iii) reduce energy import dependency and current account imbalances.","[Bulut, Umit] Kirsehir Ahi Evran Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Kirsehir, Turkey; [Muratoglu, Gonul] Ankara Haci Bayram Veli Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Ahi Evran University; Ankara Haci Bayram Veli University,"Bulut, U (通讯作者)，Kirsehir Ahi Evran Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Kirsehir, Turkey.",ubulut@ahievran.edu.tr; gonuld@gazi.edu.tr,"Bulut, Umit/AAA-9181-2021","Bulut, Umit/0000-0002-8964-0332",,,,,74,106,107,5,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,240,250,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.057,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700024,0

Understanding the source of this variation is useful for policy makers, energy developers, and utility providers in predicting how different locales may respond to newly proposed policies and energy developments, particularly those encouraging renewable energy. Using nationally representative survey data from 2008 to 2015, we employ hierarchical linear regression to examine variation in public support for renewable energy policy, focusing on how residence in areas with extractive activities may be related to attitudes toward renewable energy policy. We test the influence of several county-level indicators, including oil production, gas production, and economic dependence on the mining sector. We also test for individual factors, including political ideology, belief in anthropogenic climate change, and several socio-demographic variables. Results suggest that individuals living in both mining-dependent counties and counties with natural gas production are somewhat less likely to support renewable energy policies than individuals living outside such places. At the individual level, belief in anthropogenic global warming is the strongest predictor of renewable energy policy support, and liberal political ideology, being more educated, and being female are also positively associated with policy support.","[Olson-Hazboun, Shawn K.] Evergreen State Coll, Grad Program Environm, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505 USA; [Howe, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, 5215 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Leiserowitz, Anthony] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Yale University,"Olson-Hazboun, SK (通讯作者)，Evergreen State Coll, Grad Program Environm, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505 USA.",hazbouns@evergreen.edu,"Leiserowitz, Anthony/ABE-6529-2020; Leiserowitz, Anthony/HGB-4208-2022; Purevjav, Bolormaa/ADH-2483-2022","Leiserowitz, Anthony/0000-0001-5349-409X; Olson Hazboun, Shawn/0000-0001-5259-3440",Surdna Foundation; Grantham Foundation; V.K.

Increasing the energy efficiency of the housing stock can help reduce household energy expenditures. Following a spike in oil prices in 2008, legislation was passed, which created the Home Energy Rebate Program. Homeowners participating in the program were eligible to receive up to a $10,000 rebate for preapproved home energy efficiency improvements. This paper examines the effect of the Home Energy Rebate program on the selling prices of single-family residences in the Fairbanks North Star Borough from 2008 through 2015 using a hedonic pricing analysis. The results show that homes that completed the Home Energy Rebate program in the Fairbanks North Star Borough sell for a 15.1-16.5% price premium over similar homes that did not complete the program, which indicates that investments in residential energy efficiency are compensated.

The results show that for the performance of overall efficiency indicators, there are still 22 cities that need to significantly improve their overall efficiency. The modified dynamic SBM model presents that the efficiency changes among the cities are not significant, indicating that the effects from government regulatory policies and governance measures during the dynamic development of 2013-2016 are not significant, and that there is a lagging effect of government policies.

It supports energy policies by providing material for an integrated assessment of alternative energy systems at national level. Taking the example of Namibia, the paper applies the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach to assess the energy systems and scenarios. Using historical data from 2000 through 2013, the authors initially characterize energy supply and demand conditions of Namibia. Subsequently they conducted simulation analyses to find out a desirable energy policy to promote energy access in Namibia through 2030 under various environmental and societal constraints. The simulation results reveal that sustainable energy access in remote areas can be better achieved by small-scale distributed renewable energy systems rather than by large-scale energy technologies. Moreover, the study shows that energy policies should adopt a broader perspective to face the challenges of sustainable energy access in countries of the Southern African region by designing alternative development pathways rather than focusing on implementing new energy technologies.","[Diaz-Maurina, Francois] UAB, ICTA, Edifici Z,Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain; [Diaz-Maurina, Francois] Stanford Univ, CISAC, Encina Hall,C228,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chiguvare, Zivayi] NUST, NEI, Private Bag 13388, Windhoek, Namibia; [Chiguvare, Zivayi] Univ Namibia UNAM, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Private Bag 13301, Windhoek, Namibia; [Gope, Gideon] NUST, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Private Bag 13388, Windhoek, Namibia",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Stanford University,"Diaz-Maurina, F (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, CISAC, Encina Hall,C228,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",fdm@stanford.edu,"Diaz-Maurin, François/ABD-9871-2020; Chiguvare, Zivayi/T-9025-2017","Diaz-Maurin, François/0000-0001-9827-2810;",project PARTICIPIA - Participatory Integrated Assessment of Energy Systems to Promote Energy Access and Efficiency; ACP-EU Cooperation Programme in Higher Education (EDULINK); a Programme of the ACP Group of States; European Union [DCI-AFS/2013/320-333],project PARTICIPIA - Participatory Integrated Assessment of Energy Systems to Promote Energy Access and Efficiency; ACP-EU Cooperation Programme in Higher Education (EDULINK); a Programme of the ACP Group of States; European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results was supported by the project PARTICIPIA - Participatory Integrated Assessment of Energy Systems to Promote Energy Access and Efficiency coordinated by the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) in Spain and funded under the ACP-EU Cooperation Programme in Higher Education (EDULINK); a Programme of the ACP Group of States, with the financial assistance of the European Union, under grant agreement no.

Microgrids can significantly reduce the cost of providing basic electrification and may also be scaled up to provide higher levels of services efficiently through energy and cost sharing. A census of 6 off-grid villages highlights the demand for electrification. On average household report a willingness to pay of USD 1.78 per month for the provision of high quality lighting and USD 3.24 per month for the addition of a fan. Furthermore, households are willing to pay an additional USD 0.89 per month for a communal load. First order cost calculations show that this demand can be met through the use of various solar topologies, in particular decentralised microgrids by local entrepreneurs with suitable public sector subsidies. Recommendations to modify the current legal framework are also presented, so as to provide an enabling environment for rural electrification through solar microgrids.","[Khan, Hassan Abbas; Nasir, Mashood; Nadeem, Muhammad Fatiq; Zaffar, Allt Nauman Ahmed] LUMS, Lahore, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Husnain Fateh] Sewanee Univ South, Sewanee, TN USA",Lahore University of Management Sciences; Sewanee: University of the South,"Khan, HA (通讯作者)，LUMS, Lahore, Pakistan.",hassan.khan@lums.edu.pk,"NASIR, MASHOOD/N-3317-2019","NASIR, MASHOOD/0000-0001-6854-1581; Zaffar, Nauman Ahmad`/0000-0002-7568-9426; Khan, Hassan/0000-0003-2847-9773","International Growth Centre (IGC), UK [37315]","International Growth Centre (IGC), UK","The authors will like to thank the International Growth Centre (IGC), UK for their support of this work through Grant no. 37315.

At the same time, regulators and environmental groups are concerned about potential environmental damage associated with hydraulic fracturing. However, small firms are protected from the full extent of their damages, while large firms must internalize a greater portion of their social costs. This paper examines the effect of firm size and liability on environmental safety in the context of hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale across three dimensions of size. Impacts of firm size on safety are found across legal, regulatory, and brand dimensions of size with the largest effects being driven by changes in regulatory liability. These safety gains are sizable as violation rates would be approximately twice as high if firms at remained at 2008 sizes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However in developing countries, only limited research has been conducted on the viability of micro-generation PV as a main stream clean energy source for greening the electricity grid. This study provides an insight into how residential PV adoption operates in a small developing country. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINBM), this study compares the influencing factors of PV adoption in the Colombo district of Sri Lanka, a lower-middle income country, against the well-established factors of PV adoption in developed countries. The results suggest that highly educated middle-aged persons and retirees in the Colombo district are more likely to adopt PV. In addition, early adopters reside in larger houses of average, or above average, housing quality. In the short term, policies focused on expanding the knowledge base on PV technology, as well as incentivising the initial costs of installation, could increase the adoption rate of PV systems in Sri Lanka. In the longer term, increasing opportunities for tertiary education could accelerate the diffusion of innovations, as well as narrow socioeconomic gaps by even distribution of benefits of technological innovations.","[Jayaweera, Nadeeka] Univ Moratuwa, Fac Architecture, Dept Architecture, Bandaranayake Mawatha 10400, Katubedda, Sri Lanka; [Jayasinghe, Chathuri L.] Univ Sri Jayewardenepura, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Stat, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka; [Weerasinghe, Sandaru N.] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England",University Moratuwa; University Sri Jayewardenepura; University of Manchester,"Jayaweera, N (通讯作者)，Univ Moratuwa, Fac Architecture, Dept Architecture, Bandaranayake Mawatha 10400, Katubedda, Sri Lanka.",njayaweera@uom.lk; chathuri@sjp.ac.lk; sandaru.weerasinghe@gmail.com,"Jayaweera, Nadeeka/GXF-6373-2022","Jayaweera, Nadeeka/0000-0002-1211-7690",Senate Research Council of the University of Moratuwa [SRC/ST/2016/23],Senate Research Council of the University of Moratuwa,"The researchers would like to thank the Senate Research Council of the University of Moratuwa, for providing the short term research grant (SRC/ST/2016/23) to conduct the research.

This paper also attempts to propose a model that evaluates off-grid electrification projects (in the global south) and their ability to guarantee sufficientarianism by examining the prospects of such projects in providing connected households access (energy security and sustainability of energy supply) and mobility (transition from a lower to higher energy level through the purchase of additional electrical equipment). Furthermore, this paper explores and provides arguments on energy bullying (by industrialized nations on developing countries mostly in SSA) while also offering suggestions for improvements in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. In essence, this paper formulates the endemic problems of energy access and energy mobility (plaguing the global south) as a justice problem and further provides insight into the exacerbation of injustice and bullying exhibited by the global north.

Yet, little is known about how members of community energy initiatives differ from non-members in terms of energy attitudes and whether different profiles of community energy members exist. This article empirically analyses the relations between community energy membership and attitudes toward RE and onshore wind energy. Based on statistical analyses of a large-scale quantitative dataset from an original survey (N = 3963) conducted with two energy cooperatives in Belgium, it contrasts different groups of cooperative members with each other and a comparison group of non-members. Results show that members have significantly more positive attitudes towards RE than non-members. Results also suggest that non-members tend to be more indifferent or more uncertain, not more objecting, than members to wind power. Finally, significant differences among cooperative members are highlighted, illustrating the contrast between communities of place and communities of interest. The findings suggest a novel perspective on the benefits of community energy membership - to overcome indifference or uncertainty - that is relevant to foster a rapid and socially acceptable low carbon transition.","[Bauwens, Thomas] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, GR C1 482 Batiment GR Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Devine-Wright, Patrick] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon EX4 4RJ, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Exeter,"Bauwens, T (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, GR C1 482 Batiment GR Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",thomas.bauwens@epfl.ch; P.G.Devine-Wright@exeter.ac.uk,"Devine-Wright, Patrick/D-2847-2011","Bauwens, Thomas/0000-0003-3462-4631; Devine-Wright, Patrick/0000-0001-5768-4835",,,,,77,120,127,9,73,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,612,625,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.062,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000056,0

We find that on-shore wind turbines negatively affect the price of surrounding properties to a distance of three kilometers. The negative impact increases with the number of wind turbines at a declining marginal rate but declines with distance. In the case of off-shore wind turbine farms, we do not find a significant effect of having an off-shore wind farm in view from a property itself or from the nearest beach, likely because the closest off-shore turbine is 9 km from the closest traded home. We illustrate the policy relevance of our findings by providing maps showing how the marginal impact of a wind turbine varies across the landscape according to the spatial distribution of home density and homes values in the proximity of a wind turbine site. The results suggest that ceteris paribus, wind turbine farms should be built quite far away from residential areas with turbines gathered in larger wind farms rather than installed as single turbines.","[Jensen, Cathrine Ulla; Panduro, Toke Emil; Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Nielsen, Anne Sofie Elberg; Dalsgaard, Mette] COWI, Econ Management & Planning, Parallelvej 2, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Lundhede, Thomas Hedemark] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; COWI A/S; University of Pretoria,"Jensen, CU (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1870 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",cuj@ifro.ku.dk,"Panduro, Toke Emil tep/D-3897-2015; Jensen, Cathrine U./E-7321-2015; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/K-8770-2014","Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark/0000-0002-3305-8343","Danish Energy Agency, an Agency under the Danish Ministry of Energy [2015 - 2728]; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF 96]","Danish Energy Agency, an Agency under the Danish Ministry of Energy; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","This paper benefited from funding through the project Wind turbines effect on the price for housing funded by the Danish Energy Agency, jr. no. 2015 - 2728, an Agency under the Danish Ministry of Energy.

This literature review explores whether the natural gas system might help enable a transition to longer term use of hydrogen in transportation. Two transition strategies are reviewed: adapting natural gas refueling infrastructure for future use with H2 and blending renewable hydrogen into the NG system. Our review suggests it is not attractive to re-purpose or overbuild NG fueling station equipment for future hydrogen service, Transporting H2/NG blends in the NG pipeline grid appears technically possible at modest fractions of 5-15% hydrogen by volume, but requires careful case by case assessment and could be expensive. Blending does not enable major reductions in GHG emissions from transport, unless green hydrogen can be cost effectively separated from the blend and delivered to highly efficient fuel cell vehicles. Ultimately, blend limits could make it difficult to utilize the existing NG system to deliver hydrogen at the scale needed to achieve deep cuts in transportation related GHGs. A dedicated renewable hydrogen system would be needed, if zero emission fuel cell vehicles play a major role in a future low carbon world.","[Ogden, Joan; Jaffe, Amy Myers; McDonald, Zane; Miller, Marshall] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1605 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Scheitrum, Daniel] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Ogden, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, 1605 Tilia St, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jmogden@ucdavis.edu; abmjaffe@ucdavis.edu; dpscheitrum@ucdavis.edu; zlmcdonald@ucdavis.edu; mmiller@ucdavis.edu,"Scheitrum, Daniel/KBQ-6842-2024","Scheitrum, Daniel/0000-0002-2301-0928",California Air Resources Board [13-307]; Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways (STEPS) program at UC Davis; Leighty Foundation,California Air Resources Board; Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways (STEPS) program at UC Davis; Leighty Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the California Air Resources Board for research support under contract 13-307, Potential to Build Current Natural Gas Infrastructure to Accommodate the Future Conversion to Near-Zero Transportation Technology.

We examined the potential of all-electric freight trucks to achieve 64% GHG emissions reduction by 2040. The results suggest that even the stringent regulations on fuel efficiency of conventional trucks will fail to steadily decrease the emissions. More than 65% of freight trucks would have to run on all-electric powertrains which translates into 100% sector penetration as early as 2025. We assessed the available local energy resources for mass market penetration of all-electric trucks. The results suggest that every 1% of GHG emissions reduction from road freight transport would require 1.5-3.8% additional hydroelectric generation by 2040. Correspondingly, a 64% reduction requires 12-33 TWh of electricity. That is 2.5-6.5 times the projected generation of the B.C.'s largest hydroelectric project in decades (Site C). Hence, new policies are required to support diversified renewable electricity generation and low-carbon pathways. For example, carbon capture and sequestration coupled with provincial reserves of natural gas can enable low-carbon hydrogen production and decrease the electricity requirements for zero-emission vehicles in B.C.","[Talebian, Hoda; Herrera, Omar E.; Tran, Martino; Merida, Walter] Univ British Columbia, Clean Energy Res Ctr, 2360 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Mérida, W (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Clean Energy Res Ctr, 2360 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",walter.merida@ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions,This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship and the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions.,,64,43,47,5,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,109,118,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.004,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800012,0

From this perspective, we also examine cause-effect relationships between the hindering factors and the actors. Hindering factors, reported by IESCs, were categorised under a revised barrier taxonomy consisting of economic market failures and economic market, behavioural, organisational and institutional barriers. The most salient hindering factors lack of technical skills, disinterest in energy efficiency improvements and non-functional regulation were analysed with respect to ecosystem actors causing and affected by these factors. Public actors have a key role in overcoming these barriers, for instance, by creating new possibilities for entrants to take part in decision-making, increasing the functionality and practicality of policies and by providing up-to date energy efficiency information.","[Kangas, Hanna-Liisa; Lazarevic, David; Kivimaa, Paula] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Environm Policy Ctr, PL 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland; [Lazarevic, David] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Tekn Ringen 23, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kivimaa, Paula] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sussex House, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",Finnish Environment Institute; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Sussex,"Lazarevic, D (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Environm Policy Ctr, PL 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland.;Lazarevic, D (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Tekn Ringen 23, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",hanna-liisa.kangas@ymparisto.fi; david.lazarevic@ymparisto.fi; P.Kivimaa@sussex.ac.uk,"Kivimaa, Paula/AAY-3418-2021","Kivimaa, Paula/0000-0003-2812-8017; Lazarevic, David/0000-0002-9869-9707",Academy of Finland [286230]; Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE); UK EPSRC through the Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand [EP/KO11790/1]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Academy of Finland (AKA) [286230] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE); UK EPSRC through the Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Academy of Finland (AKA),This work was funded by the Academy of Finland (Decision Number 286230) as a part of New Energy Academy Programme and the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) and supported by the UK EPSRC through the Centre for Innovation and Energy Demand (grant number EP/KO11790/1).,,56,66,67,2,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,63,76,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.060,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800007,0

Our data set allows us to distinguish between the two channels, which improves our understanding of the frequently observed positive net effect of policies. Controlling for the demand-side effect, taxes and regulations are negatively related with green product innovation.

The estimation results indicate that government ideology is a significant determinant of carbon dioxide emissions only in the lower quantiles of the distribution. Specifically, the left-wing governments are associated with lower carbon dioxide emissions among the least polluted countries. Contrarily, the effect of government ideology on carbon dioxide emissions is statistically insignificant in the median and upper quantiles of the distribution, suggesting that government ideology does not have significant influences on carbon dioxide emissions among the median and most polluted nations. It was also found that the effects of government ideology on carbon dioxide emissions differ remarkably at different quantiles of the distribution in developed and developing countries.","[Chang, Chun-Ping] Shih Chien Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Mkt Management, Kaohsiung 845, Taiwan; [Chang, Chun-Ping; Wen, Jun; Dong, Minyi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Shih Chien University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",cpchang@g2.usc.edu.tw; wjun1978@163.com; sherrydong@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; haoyuking@bit.edu.cn,"Wen, Jun/N-8547-2016; Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Wen, Jun/0000-0002-7544-1076; Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403015, 71521002]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation [9162013]; key research program of Beijing Social Science Foundation [17JDYJA009]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603]; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); key research program of Beijing Social Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403015, 71521002), Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (9162013), the key research program of Beijing Social Science Foundation (17JDYJA009), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFA0602801, 2016YFA0602603), and Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.

We use a new linear programming optimization model to identify least-cost pathways to decarbonize Canada's electricity sector. We co-optimize investments in new generation, storage and transmission capacity, and the hourly dispatch of available assets over the course of a year. Our model includes hourly wind speed data for 2281 locations in Canada, hourly solar irradiation data from 199 Canadian meteorological stations, hourly demand data for each province, and inter- and intra-provincial transmission line data. We model the capacity of hydropower plants to store potential energy and respond to variations in renewable energy output and demand. We find that new transmission connections between provinces and a substantial expansion of wind power in high wind locations such as southern Saskatchewan and Alberta would allow Canada to reduce electricity sector emissions at the lowest cost. We find that hydropower plants and inter-provincial trade can provide important balancing services that allow for greater integration of variable wind power. We test the impact of carbon pricing on Canada's optimal electricity system and fmd that prices of $80/tonne CO(2)e render the majority of Canada's coal-fired plants uneconomic.","[Dolter, Brett] Univ Ottawa, Inst Environm, 1 Stewart St 301, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Inst Environm, Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa,"Dolter, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Inst Environm, 1 Stewart St 301, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",brett.dolter@gmail.com,"Dolter, Brett/AAZ-3993-2020","Dolter, Brett/0000-0003-2840-1925",Social Science and Humanities Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowships Program; Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Research Chairs Program,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowships Program; Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Research Chairs Program,Dolter acknowledges the funding received from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowships Program.

The analysis of regional electricity consumption changes is carried out by introducing a spatial shift share decomposition measuring the neighbourhood effect on regional energy efficiency change. Our findings show that a shift toward less electricity-intensive activity sectors has occurred in almost all regions, reducing regional electricity consumption. A fall in economic activity has contributed to reducing electricity consumption in many regions, especially in Southern Italy. Notwithstanding the negative contributions of changes in industry mix and economic activity, electricity consumption has increased in most regions due to the increase in electricity intensity. The increase in electricity intensity in Southern and North-Eastern regions has been enhanced by a neighbourhood disadvantage in energy efficiency. Electricity intensity has decreased in most NUTS 3 regions in Sardinia, an Italian region at the NUTS 2 level, due to both regional and neighbourhood advantages in energy efficiency.","[Grossi, Luigi; Mussini, Mauro] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Mussini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",luigi.grossi@univr.it; mauro.mussini@univr.it,"GROSSI, Luigi/HOH-7776-2023","GROSSI, Luigi/0000-0003-3671-7348",,,,,33,14,15,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,278,293,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.043,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500027,0

In this paper, an international input-output analysis (IOA) was applied and several expanding-descriptive indicators were chosen to measure the energy transformation embodied in India-China manufacturing trade from 1996 to 2011. Furthermore, the main driving factors of the change in embodied energy were examined by structural decomposition analysis (SDA). The results showed that the total energy use in bilateral trade and net embodied energy imports in India's manufacturing increased by about 11 times and 40 times, respectively. Energy terms of trade in India's manufacturing appeared in an M shape with a deteriorating tendency, which indicated that India's manufacturing gradually lost its advantage of energy conservation exchanged by trade deficit. The major manufactures, which had lower trade profits and larger energy demands, were of light industries in India but were of heavy industries in China. Scale effect was the strongest driving factor for the increase of the embodied energy. Technique effect had the greatest negative effect and could offset the increase in embodied energy by about 13.18-54.49%. According to our research, it could be concluded that energy cooperation is necessary and has a wide prospect for India and China.","[Sun, Chuanwang; Ma, Tiemeng] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chuanwang; Xu, Meilian] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Deparanent Int Econ & Business, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Xu, ML (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Deparanent Int Econ & Business, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",mlxu@xmu.edu.cn,"Sun, Chuanwang/JOZ-8733-2023","Sun, Chuanwang/0000-0002-1900-4699; Ma, Tiemeng/0000-0002-6073-3551","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673230, 71303199, 71373218]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720171001, 20720151026, 20720151039]; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD167]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editor and anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments.

To fill this gap, this paper explores the relationship between individual-level subjective well-being and spatial variables in urban areas. This resolution is achieved by utilizing finely divided geographical information system (GIS)-based neighbourhood data, and controlling for objective and subjective spatial characteristics, as well as socio-spatial factors. The results suggest that subjective well-being has some spatial nature, but the direction of these relationships is highly dependent on the subjective well-being measure used. For example, central pedestrian zones flourish in terms of quality of life, whereas the highest happiness is reported in car-oriented zones. Overall, subjective spatial characteristics are more important for well-being than objective ones.","[Ala-Mantila, Sanna; Junnila, Seppo] Aalto Univ Sch Engn, Dept Built Environm, Espoo, Finland; [Heinonen, Jukka] Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Saarsalmi, Perttu] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf THL, Welf & Hlth Promot Unit, Helsinki, Finland",Aalto University; University of Iceland; Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare,"Ala-Mantila, S (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ Sch Engn, Dept Built Environm, Espoo, Finland.",salamantila@gmail.com; heinonen@hi.is; seppo.junnila@aalto.fi; perttu.saarsalmi@gmail.com,"Heinonen, Jukka/K-6952-2015; Junnila, Seppo/G-2269-2013","Heinonen, Jukka/0000-0002-7298-4999; Ala-Mantila, Sanna/0000-0002-5140-7973; Junnila, Seppo/0000-0002-2984-0383","Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [3000/31/2015]","Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation(Finnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES))","This work was supported by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [grant number 3000/31/2015].",,96,43,46,13,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, the introduction of a flat rate income tax has become a trend in the transition economies of Eastern and Central Europe. There are several advantages of flat income taxes over its progressive counterpart. Complicated income tax system is simplified, which is not only convenient for citizens, but a positive impact on economic competitiveness makes the country more attractive for foreign investors as well. The main counterargument of the opponents is that the introduction of the flat tax rate significantly reduces government revenue. From current EU member states, Estonia and Lithuania introduced the flat rate income tax in 1994, followed later by Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. The last EU member state that so far adopted the flat rate income tax is Hungary (in 2011). However, the Czech Republic and Slovakia replaced the flat tax rate with two income tax rates in 2013 and Latvia with three income tax rates in 2018. In our contribution, we examine whether the introduction of the flat income tax rate in Hungary influenced the economic growth of the country. Using the difference-in-differences method, we demonstrate that it had a positive effect on the growth of GDP per capita. On the other hand, we investigate if the replacement of the flat tax by the progressive tax in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 2013 negatively affected the growth of GDP per capita.","[Bohm, Patrik; Bohmova, Gabriela] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Böhm, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",patrik.bohm@fpedas.uniza.sk; gabriela.bohmova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Bohm, Patrik/P-4697-2016; PETRE, BREZEANU/F-9468-2012; Bohmova, Gabriela/P-4706-2016","Bohm, Patrik/0000-0002-3210-1055; Bohmova, Gabriela/0000-0001-6416-4352",,,,,21,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1480,1487,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300189,0

In the PLT, subjects list properties that describe concepts in their minds. This ABM views the PLT as a communicative process, by which agents list properties for a concept, so that they can achieve a given level of agreement among them, i.e. produce properties that are more or less the same among agents. Using Conceptual Agreement Theory (CAT), we model that agreement in the ABM and are able to derive functional forms that the ABM's outputs should follow. The results show that agents produce agreement curves that indeed match the stated functional forms and also reasonably follow the corresponding curves obtained from empirical data. Thus, the ABM can now be used to better understand the PLT and also be further developed to model how subjects may stop listing properties for a concept according to some criteria based on the achieved level of agreement.","[Canessa, Enrique] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingeniena & Ciencias, CINCO, Av P Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Chaigneau, Sergio E.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Psicol, CINCO, Av D Tones 2640, Santiago, Chile; [Barra, Carlos] Las Pimpinelas 880, Concon, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Canessa, E (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingeniena & Ciencias, CINCO, Av P Hurtado 750, Vina Del Mar, Chile.",ecanessa@uai.cl; sergio.chaigneau@uai.cl; c.barra@vtr.net,"Chaigneau, Sergio/AAG-6105-2020","Chaigneau, Sergio/0000-0001-8642-6325; Canessa, Enrique/0000-0002-4931-5025",FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of the Chilean Government) [1150074]; CONICYT,FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of the Chilean Government)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"This work was supported by CONICYT, FONDECYT (Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of the Chilean Government) grant Nr. 1150074 to the first two authors.",,13,0,0,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,13,19,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000003,0

The application of the TOPSIS method at present achieves wide-area use across the globe and, thanks to the impact of globalization, this method also belongs in the conditions of the Slovak Republic among the most frequently used methods. In this article, we prove that by applying mathematical and statistical strategies in decision-making, we can increase the probability of choosing the right decision, unlike a decision based solely on intuition. For models of multi-criteria decision-making, it is necessary to determine suitable parameters that influence the choice of the most appropriate method. The chosen method of multi-criteria decision-making is applied in the inter-company benchmark process, while using the financial analysis indicators as performance criteria. Benchmarking is part of analytical-synthetic quality management methods that provides a continuous analysis of the company position in domestic or global competitive environment. The benchmark process is applied to ten real medium-sized businesses with a staff of 100 to 200. The model is influenced by selected thirteen financial analysis indicators that tend to evaluate all components of the financial equilibrium. Using this method, we determine the resulting order of companies by eliminating the degree of subjectivity in this decision-making process, and by that, we review the reality better and more authentic.","[Cugova, Aneta] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Cepel, Martin] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",University of Zilina; Pan-European University,"Cugova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",aneta.cugova@fpedas.uniza.sk; cepel@benzinol.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1502,1509,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300192,0

Worldwide the performance of transportation and logistics companies varies greatly. One of the main reasons for this is the quality of infrastructure, which is fundamental to their effective operation. The importance of good logistics performance for economic growth, diversification and poverty reduction is now firmly established. The transportation and logistics industry forms the backbone of modern global supply chains. The logistics industry encompasses freight transportation, warehousing, border clearance, payment systems and, increasingly, many other functions outsourced by producers and merchants to service providers. Russia has a potential for logistics cluster development but there are some factors which need to expect. There are population incomes, economic climate, quality of auto and rail roads and transportation routes and others. Transportation is a cost of doing business. Improvements in the transportation system may not generate large numbers of new jobs, but they are important to enhance the competitive position of the region in the global aspect.

Ruud",JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Closed form; Invertibility; Linear index; Robustness,,"This is an interesting article that considers the question of inference on unknown linear index coefficients in a general class of models where reduced form parameters are invertible function of one or more linear index. Interpretable sufficient conditions such as monotonicity and or smoothness for the invertibility condition are provided. The results generalize some work in the previous literature by allowing the number of reduced form parameters to exceed the number of indices. The identification and estimation expand on the approach taken in previous work by the authors. Examples include Ahn, Powell, and Ichimura (2004) for monotone single-index regression models to a multi-index setting and extended by Blundell and Powell (2004) and Powell and Ruud (2008) to models with endogenous regressors and multinomial response, respectively. A key property of the inference approach taken is that the estimator of the unknown index coefficients (up to scale) is computationally simple to obtain (relative to other estimators in the literature) in that it is closed form. Specifically, unifying an approach for all models considered in this article, the authors propose an estimator, which is the eigenvector of a matrix (defined in terms of a preliminary estimator of the reduced form parameters) corresponding to its smallest eigenvalue. Under suitable conditions, the proposed estimator is shown to be root-n-consistent and asymptotically normal.","[Khan, S.] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Tamer, E.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston College; Harvard University,"Khan, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",shakeeb.khan@bc.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,6,2,3,0,1,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The input data are obtained from the relevant official sources, particularly from databases of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic. For the evaluation of the tax rate importance, statistical methods of hypotheses testing are used. The Gretl software is used as the main tool. The results can be potentially used for assessing fiscal policies in the states around the world, based on these results to propose an adjustment of the tax system in the field of excise duties and consequently to estimate the tax yield of excise duties globally with respect to conditions of the current economies around the world.","[Kukalova, Gabriela; Moravec, Lukas; Filipova, Dana Bina; Webrova, Kamila] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Moravec, L (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",kukalova@pef.czu.cz; moravec@pef.czu.cz; xbind002@studenti.czu.cz; webr.k@seznam.cz,"Kukalova, Gabriela/B-6171-2018",,"Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of Faculty of Economics and Management, CULS Prague [20181013]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of Faculty of Economics and Management, CULS Prague","This paper is an output of the science project No. 20181013 - Tax Laboratory Pilot Project Utilizing the Human Behavior Research Unit of FEM CULS Prague, supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of Faculty of Economics and Management, CULS Prague.",,14,0,0,2,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1699,1706,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300217,0

One of the effective areas of management is value management of the company - Value Based Management (VBM), the main difference of which is the orientation on the quality of management and development of the enterprise, as well as satisfaction of the requirements of the owners and stakeholders of the enterprise. Despite the fact that modern trading enterprises have a significant volume of non-current assets, the main contour of creating value for them remains operational activity, however, the growth of competition due to globalization and the growth of innovative activity requires from trading enterprises to find new levers for creating value. The article shows that for trade enterprises the key factors of sustainable development will be the factors that are associated with the creation of value in the process of operating, investment and financial activities of a trading enterprise.

Using data from ADP, Pew Research Center, SMB Group, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census, we performed analyses and made estimates regarding gig work (online selling appeal to different segments of the population), the proportion of U.S. adults in various groups who have earned money in the last year by using digital work or task platforms or selling something online, the total number of U.S. employees interested in some type of flexibility (by age), the percentage of contingent workers in the U.S. workforce, and views of the benefits of Internet-enabled gig work. Empirical and secondary data are used to support the claim that flexibility in the on-demand sector is restricted to two main functions: workers' capacity to self-organize and to refuse or comply with job orders. Being able to turn down an order indicates that, even when logged on, employees can reject orders that yield too little profit. Self-scheduling enables employees to take time off smoothly and without having to ask permission. Workers' awareness and backgrounds inform the competent estimations they perform in professional immediate decisions. Control, basically, depends of employees' eagerness to follow through to the estimated judgments that firm project onto them.","[Popescu, Catalin Kanty; Bogdan, Alexandru; Curteanu, Adrian Bogdan; Ciurlau, Florin Cristian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Pera, Aurel] Univ Craiova, Dept Teacher Training, Alexandra Ioan Cuza St 13, Craiova 200585, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Craiova,"Popescu, CK (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",catakpopescu@yahoo.com; aurelpera@yahoo.com; alexandru.bogdan@gmail.com; adrian.bogdan.curteanu@gmail.com; cristianciurlau@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,848,853,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300110,0

These quantiles can be difficult to estimate in practice. This article uses a minimum distance approach to estimate them that is easy to compute. A version of our estimator is a solution to a nonlinear least-square problem that can be straightforwardly programmed on softwares such as STATA. We show our estimator is consistent and has an asymptotic normal distribution. Its distribution can be consistently estimated by a bootstrap. Our estimator can be used to estimate the cost distribution nonparametrically on a larger support when prices from heterogenous markets are available. We propose a two-step sieve estimator for that case. The first step estimates quantiles from each market. They are used in the second step as generated variables to perform nonparametric sieve estimation. We derive the uniform rate of convergence of the sieve estimator that can be used to quantify the errors incurred from interpolating data across markets. To illustrate we use online bookmaking odds for English football leagues' matches (as prices) and find evidence that suggests search costs for consumers have fallen following a change in the British law that allows gambling operators to advertise more widely.

For the investor, it will therefore be extremely important to know how best to measure the country risk and to be able to respond to this risk in a timely manner. Currently, we can find several research studies which examine the different methods of country risk and the empirical relationship between sovereign rating of a country and the components of its capital market. In our contribution, we will focus on two different methods of measuring country risk. On the one hand, we have a sovereign rating method that measures the credit risk of the issuer (state), while on the other, we have a market-based method - bond spreads. At present, we often find that credit rating agencies are inefficient, delayed and often copied by other agencies. Therefore, we can assume that the markets will respond to the problems sooner than rating agencies.","[Slobodnik, Patrik] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Slobodník, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",patrik.slobodnik@gmail.com,,,VEGA [1/0009/17],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This contribution is the result for the project VEGA (1/0009/17) The making of the Capital union in Europe and its impact on individual member counties.,,13,0,0,0,0,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4571-6,,,,2018,,,,,,,455,463,,,,,,9,Business; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BN0SZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473407100053,0

If one of these energy sources offshore wind becomes a common sight off coastlines, consideration of local public opinion and action will be critical. Previous research from the social sciences has lacked depth in examining the underlying factors that shape public opinion towards offshore wind development. The current research brings a new perspective to the literature by showing that how members of the public perceive support among others relates to their own opinions of offshore wind energy. We report results from two surveys. The first focused on opinion formation relating to offshore wind in general among New England residents, while the second focused on a specific offshore wind project in Rhode Island. We find evidence that both supporters and opponents of offshore wind underestimate levels of support among others, indicating a pluralistic ignorance effect and false consensus effect, respectively. We also find distinct patterns of perceived support among self-identified Republicans and Democrats. The findings hold important implications for policymakers and developers in understanding the nature of public support and opposition for offshore wind energy, particularly with respect to individuals' willingness to publicly engage with offshore wind projects.","[Sokoloski, Rebecca; Markowitz, Ezra M.] Univ Massachusetts, Environm Conservat Dept, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bidwell, David] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Marine Affairs, 1 Greenhouse Rd,Suite 209, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Rhode Island,"Sokoloski, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Environm Conservat Dept, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rsokoloski@umass.edu,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project [1007596]; NIFA [1007596, 812914] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project 1007596.

The equity method is used to measure shares in specific capital relations and to demonstrate consolidated capital. In accordance with subsequent amendments to IAS/IFRS, this method is applied more increasingly and generally regards the largest business entities, including capital groups. However, the next result of using this method is also the concealment of acquired goodwill, which, as an asset of a business entity and a capital group, is becoming more and more important in the light of the accuracy of assessing changes in the global economy. The aim of the paper is to indicate the advantages and disadvantages of the equity method and to demonstrate the effects of adopting this method in the context of globalization processes. The paper examines financial reports of companies using this method, listed in the WIG 30 index on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The paper shows that the equity method presents the effects of the investor's acquisition of shares in another entity in an insufficiently clear and transparent manner. This can be a disinformation factor for investors. The trend to expand the scope of this method for different types of capital relations may be a dangerous factor in the assessment of capital globalization processes.

Many times, companies are standardizing their global pricing strategies, and the extent of their standardization depends on several factors, such as the level of similarity between domestic and foreign countries, the economic and business environment, cultural differences and so on. The aim of the contribution is therefore to explain the key aspects of pricing and selection of the pricing strategy in the global environment in sense of highlighting the importance of adapting pricing strategies to the conditions of the global environment. In the first part, we are focusing on explaining the nature of pricing and possible pricing strategies in case that the business is only active in one country. Subsequently, the main factors influencing the pricing process under international conditions, international pricing strategies and factors influencing the choice of the strategy, are explained.","[Valjaskova, Viera] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Valjaskova, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",viera.valjaskova@fpedas.uniza.sk,,,VEGA [1/0718/18],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This contribution is an output of scientific project VEGA no. 1/0718/18: The impact of psychographic aspects of pricing on the marketing strategy of companies across products and markets.,,20,0,0,2,21,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1895,1902,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300242,0

To this end it comes as no surprise the fact that initiatives and policies in the field of energy saving focus on this sector in order to improve the energy performance of societies. The reduction of the energy consumption of dwellings becomes more important when social housing buildings are discussed, not only due to the fact that they constitute a major part of the European building stock, but also because the main concept of these buildings is that they are used by low income or vulnerable social classes. The main aim of this study is to discuss the impact of the implementation of the energy performance of the EU buildings Directive on the energy performance of the Cyprus Land Development Corporation buildings, which is the main social housing association of Cyprus. For this purpose the building stock of the corporation was studied, and detailed analysis of the actual performance and of the structural and thermal features of the considered dwellings was performed. This study produced well justified conclusions concerning the decrease of the energy consumption of Cyprus social housing corporation buildings, as well as important findings concerning the appropriate indicators which should be used in the case of the analysis of buildings energy performance. Further findings of this study include the considerations of the end-energy use for the reliable comparison between the energy habits and the lifestyle of social housing occupants, and the importance of exploiting social housing buildings both for proving the effectiveness of building related energy policies, as well as to introduce novel future relevant policies.","[Fokaides, Paris A.] Frederick Univ, Sch Engn, 7 Frederickou Str, CY-1036 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Polycarpou, Kyriacos] Cyprus Land Dev Corp, 14 Athalassas Av, CY-1687 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Kalogirou, Soteris] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci & Engn Cyprus, 30 Archbishop Kyprianou Str, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus",Cyprus University of Technology,"Fokaides, PA (通讯作者)，Frederick Univ, Sch Engn, 7 Frederickou Str, CY-1036 Nicosia, Cyprus.",p.fokaides@frederick.ac.cy; kyriakospolykarpou@gmail.com; soteris.kalogirou@cut.ac.cy,"Fokaides, Paris/B-7047-2018; Fokaides, Paris/HTS-0039-2023; Kalogirou, Soteris A/D-3883-2015","Fokaides, Paris/0000-0003-4112-3819; Polycarpou, Kyriacos/0000-0002-0011-3393",,,,,15,41,41,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.009,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700001,0

It also estimates for each policy, the cost per ton of coal saved and the cost per ton of CO2, SO2, NOx, PM and mercury abated. Results show that, compared with a business as usual (BAU) case, the implementation of these policies will reduce coal consumption and CO2 emissions by 9.61-13.77% and will eliminate more than half of air pollutant emissions, at an annualized cost in the range of $43.5-97.4 billion. Among the policies analyzed, the development of renewable power and the mandate for retrofits of existing coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) are the most promising for reducing energy consumption and emissions; the former has the highest potential for reducing coal usage and CO2 emissions; while the latter can contribute the most to the reduction of air pollutant emissions. The two most cost-effective policies for reducing coal consumption and air emissions are a) imposing technology standards for new CFPPs and b) mandating retrofits for existing CFPPs. In contrast, the adoption of low-sulfur coal is the costliest policy.","[Li, Mingquan; Patino-Echeverri, Dalia] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Li, Mingquan] Duke Univ, 9 Circuit Dr,Environm Hall 3118, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Patiño-Echeverri, D (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, 9 Circuit Dr,Environm Hall 3118, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",limingquan2009@gmail.com; dalia.patino@duke.edu,"Li, Mingquan/AAQ-3052-2020","Li, Mingquan/0000-0003-3929-6470; Li, Mingquan/0000-0003-0289-5752","Chinese Culture and Education Center of Upstate (CCEC); Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making - National Science Foundation [SES-0949710]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1463492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Chinese Culture and Education Center of Upstate (CCEC); Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making - National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Mingquan Li received financial support from the Chinese Culture and Education Center of Upstate (CCEC).

Heat can be supplied to buildings in these areas through individual solutions, through a small, on-site heat network, or through a heat connection to a close-by district-heating (DH) system. The choice between these options affects the energy supply systems and their carbon emissions far beyond the LEB area. We compare the long-term systems impacts of the three heat-supply options through dynamic modelling of the energy systems. The study draws on data collected from a real LEB area in Sweden and addresses scale-dependent impacts on district heating systems. The results show that, generally, the individual and on-site options increase biomass and electricity use, respectively. This, in turn, increases carbon emissions in a broader systems perspective. The systems impacts of the large heat network option depend on the scale and supply-technologies of the DH system close to the LEB area.","[Sandvall, Akram Fakhri; Ahlgren, Erik O.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Environm & Energy, Div Energy Technol, Energy Syst Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Ekvall, Tomas] Swedish Environm Res Inst IVL, SE-40014 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute,"Ahlgren, EO (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Environm & Energy, Div Energy Technol, Energy Syst Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",erik.ahlgren@chalmers.se,"Ekvall, Tomas/AAS-2090-2021",,Swedish Energy Agency; multi-partner 4DH project,Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); multi-partner 4DH project,"The study was financed by the Swedish Energy Agency and the multi-partner 4DH project, led by Aalborg University, the J.

A regression model is developed to accurately estimate construction costs for LNG refueling stations on the turnpike. To solve the bi-objective model, the second objective (capital cost) is treated as an infrastructure budget constraint and the model is run considering a range of infrastructure budget values. Given that alternative fuels and fuel economy legislation dates back to the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1970, which created initiatives to reduce mobile sources of pollutants, further analysis is performed on the case study to estimate the potential reduction of pollutants on the PA Turnpike as a function of the LNG infrastructure cost.","[Ventura, Jose A.; Kweon, Sang Jin; Hwang, Seong Wook; Tormay, Matthew; Li, Chenxi] Penn State Univ, Harold & Inge Marcus Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Ventura, JA (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Harold & Inge Marcus Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jav1@psu.edu,"Kweon, Sang Jin/AEU-1714-2022","Kweon, Sang Jin/0000-0002-3573-1896",,,,,46,22,22,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,427,439,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.035,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700043,0

Jatropha curcas. L. (Jatropha) was the main bioenergy crop adopted for production under out-grower schemes in Zambia. However, recent studies report worldwide abandonment of Jatropha production. This study therefore investigated factors responsible for the abandonment of Jatropha production under out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia. A total of 110 smallholder farmers who participated in these out-grower schemes and one key informant were selected using snowball sampling. Primary data was collected using field observations and a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Findings reveal that abandonment of Jatropha production was mainly driven by lack of market for the produce, and non-commitment of the sponsoring firm to contractual agreements under the out-grower schemes. Thus, more than 90% of the farmers did not earn income from the sale of Jatropha. To achieve optimal performance of these out-grower schemes, a supporting policy environment and legal framework enforcing compliance to contractual agreements are required. Further, such should be accompanied by creation of market opportunities for the crop as well as its price regulation.","[Kunda-Wamuwi, Chibuye F.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog, Ctr Environm Studies, Pretoria, South Africa; [Kunda-Wamuwi, Chibuye F.] Univ Zambia, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Lusaka, Zambia; [Babalola, Folaranmi D.] Univ Ilorin, Forest Resources Management, Ilorin, Nigeria; [Babalola, Folaranmi D.; Chirwa, Paxie W.] Univ Pretoria, Forest Sci Postgrad Programme, 5-15 Plant Sci Complex, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Zambia; University of Ilorin; University of Pretoria,"Kunda-Wamuwi, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog, Ctr Environm Studies, Pretoria, South Africa.",chibuyek@yahoo.com,"Babalola, Folaranmi D./AAD-9791-2020","Babalola, Folaranmi D./0000-0002-8837-0991",MUNDO,MUNDO,"The study was sponsored through scholarship by MUNDO to the first author to pursue her MSc at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.

Analyzing this second category of studies, we find they have in various ways counted the carbon benefits of using land for biofuels but ignored the costs. Basic carbon opportunity cost calculations per hectare explain why alternative uses of any available land are likely to do more to hold down climate change. Because we find that solar power can provide at least 100 times more useable energy per hectare on three quarters of the world's land, any surplus land could also provide the same energy and mitigate climate at least 100 times more if 1% were devoted to solar and the rest to carbon storage. Review of large bioenergy potential estimates from recent IAMB shows that they depend on many contingencies for carbon benefits, can impose many biodiversity and food costs, and are more predictions of what bioenergy might be in idealized than plausible, future scenarios.

However, the superiority of competition over regulated monopolies is not established. In a liberalized market, consumers exercising their ability to choose a utility provider is a crucial way of shaping the outcomes of deregulatory reform. While achieving a high switching rate is not the ultimate goal of market reform, it is an important tool through which consumers gain from policy form. We use data from a Japanese household survey conducted before and after recent liberalization and find a positive impact of liberalization on consumer satisfaction by enabling consumers to choose an electricity provider. This result indicates that switching can be utility improving by increasing customer satisfaction and underlines the importance of switching behavior in effectively utilizing deregulatory reform. This study also examines a broad set of determinants of provider switching and discusses the policy implications of the empirical results.","[Shin, Kong Joo; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Shin, Kong Joo; Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Shin, KJ (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Urban & Environm Engn, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.;Shin, KJ (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Sch Engn, Urban Inst, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",kongjooshin@gmail.com; managi.s@gmail.com,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) [26000001, 26285050, 26285057]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285050, 26285057, 26000001] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the following Grants in Aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT): Grant in Aid for Specially Promoted Research 26000001, Grant in Aid for Scientific Research (A) 26285050, and Grant in Aid for Scientific Research (B) 26285057.

However, there exist considerable differences in migration rates by college major that have gone largely unexplained. This paper uses microdata from the American Community Survey to examine how the migration decisions of young college graduates are affected by earnings in their college major. Results indicate that higher major-specific earnings in an individual's state of birth reduce out-migration suggesting that college graduates are attracted toward areas that especially reward the specific type of human capital that they possess.","[Winters, John V.] Oklahoma State Univ, 331 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Winters, John V.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Winters, JV (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, 331 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.;Winters, JV (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",jvwinte@okstate.edu,,"Winters, John/0000-0002-0542-1416",,,,,53,12,13,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In particular it looks at the potential of storage to: 1. reduce impacts on power flows due to local supply and demand imbalances driven by PV deployment within the UK domestic and non-domestic markets; 2. of improving PV capacity credit, i.e. the contribution of installed PV to meeting electricity demand within the UK electricity system. Results highlight how, under current levels of deployment, PV generation does not create major problems for the local distribution network, but that storage might play a relevant role for higher levels of PV deployment across the UK. The paper contribute to academic debate in the field by providing a novel locally disaggregated framework for the analysis of embedded PV generation integration into the distribution grid. It also provides a useful tool for network operators, regulators and policy makers.","[Candelise, Chiara] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Candelise, Chiara] Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Ctr Res Energy Environm Econ & Policy, Milan, Italy; [Westacott, Paul] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Energy Policy & Technol, London, England",Imperial College London; Bocconi University; Imperial College London,"Candelise, C (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England.;Candelise, C (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Ctr Res Energy Environm Econ & Policy, Milan, Italy.",c.candelise05@imperial.ac.uk,,"Candelise, Chiara/0000-0002-1776-4395",RCUK's Energy Programme [EP/K02227X/1],RCUK's Energy Programme,This work was conducted as part of the research project 'PV2025 Potential Costs and Benefits of Photovoltaic for UK Infrastructure and Society' funded by the RCUK's Energy Programme (Contract no: EP/K02227X/1).,,53,14,14,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,694,703,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.054,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400068,0

We examine spatial and temporal variations in generation mix across the region and year using the PLEXOS unit commitment and dispatch model with a production cost model database adapted from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Emissions estimates are computed by combining the dispatch model results with unit specific, emissions-load relationships. Wind energy displaces natural gas and coal in scenarios with relatively expensive natural gas or with GHG fees. Correspondingly, annual emissions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 are reduced by 20-40% in these cases. NOx emissions, which are a concern as a precursor of ground-level ozone, are relatively high and consistent across scenarios during summer, when peak electricity loads occur and wind resources in the region are comparatively weak. Accounting for the difference in start-up versus stabilized NOx emissions rates for natural gas plants had little impact on region-wide emissions estimates due to the dominant contribution from coal-fired plants, but would be more important in the vicinity of the natural gas units.","[Nsanzineza, Rene; Milford, Jana B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, 1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [O'Connell, Matthew; Brinkman, Gregory] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Milford, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Mech Engn, 1111 Engn Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Rene.Nsanzineza@colorado.edu; Matthew.00onnell@nrel.gov; gregory.brinkman@nrel.gov; jana.milford@colorado.edu,,"O'Connell, Matthew/0000-0003-1879-6943","National Science Foundation (NSF) AirWaterGas Sustainability Research Network [CBET-1240584]; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1240584] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) AirWaterGas Sustainability Research Network(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",Support for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) AirWaterGas Sustainability Research Network CBET-1240584.

The country is also an important global supplier of coal, petroleum and natural gas while per capita fossil energy consumption is relatively low. For biomass- and fossil fuel-based energy, Indonesia has been transforming its energy landscape in order to provide for foreign demand. The landscape - both in literal and in the figurative sense - simultaneously forms and is formed by the material resource flows required for society's biophysical reproduction, i.e. the social metabolism; in the context of the ongoing energy transition, both are subject to change. In our analysis of Indonesia's palm oil production, we find that the drivers shaping the country's resource use as well as its energy landscape are located at a spatial, temporal, and functional distance from where they take effect. The energy landscape and resource use patterns are formed across levels of scale, from the subnational to the global. Energy policy confined to the framework of the sovereign nation-state cannot effectively address the complex drivers of increasingly detrimental environmental change associated with energy transitions nor can it trigger a sustainability transition.","[Schaffartzik, Anke; Pichler, Melanie] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Wien Graz, Inst Social Ecol, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Brad, Alina] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Univ Ring 1, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Schaffartzik, A (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Wien Graz, Inst Social Ecol, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",anke.schaffartzik@aau.at,"Schaffartzik, Anke/E-6733-2015","Schaffartzik, Anke/0000-0002-0284-6099; Pichler, Melanie/0000-0001-6224-1609; Brad, Alina/0000-0001-5342-1632",,,,,59,5,5,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,817,824,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.045,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400078,0

Using both static and dynamic panel data models, we find that China's crude oil import is associated with exporting country's supply, demand, and price as well as its bilateral trade relationships. These factors were found to affect China's import of crude oil from the Middle East. However, only bilateral trade relationships affect its imports of crude oil from the Asia-Pacific.

Furthermore, an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA model) is constructed using monthly electricity consumption data of residents in Guangdong to quantify the effects of implementing a TEP policy on energy saving. Meanwhile, to explore the opportunities for improving the policy, this research uses an ordered probit model to study the factors influencing the energy saving willingness of residents based on explanatory variables, such as personal characteristics, living conditions, etc. The empirical results demonstrate that, after the implementation of TEP, energy saving awareness among women is higher than that among men. With increasing levels of educational attainment, or having a family, energy saving awareness gradually increases. In addition, there is a U-type relationship between age and energy saving awareness, while a reciprocal U-type is present between income and energy saving awareness. Meanwhile, the housing ownership type (self-occupation or rental) is also closely related to the energy saving awareness of residents. Finally, according to the above research results, suggestions are put forward to improve the TEP policy.","[Wu, Ya] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ya] Jinan Univ, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainable Dev Res, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ya] Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Guangdong Power Grid Corp, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University; Jinan University; China Southern Power Grid,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",jnwy2012@126.com,,"Wu, Ya/0000-0003-3218-5217; Zhang, Li/0000-0001-9806-3760",,,,,52,23,24,0,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,208,217,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.011,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400019,0

We do not find evidence of convergence for the 72 economies during the period of 1990-2012. But the convergence hypothesis for the 19 OECD economies during the period of 1960-2012 can not be rejected.

It is found that China's pre-2020 targets are generally in line with previous projections. The 20202030 targets are quite ambitious and aggressive. If the battery technologies evolve as projected, electric vehicles will have similar market competitiveness with conventional vehicles by around 2020, implying a mass market penetration of electric vehicles. This will impose very broad impacts on China's urban environment, oil security, rare metal security, climate change mitigation and charging infrastructure deployment. On the other hand, it should be fully noted that the technology roadmap is more market demand-oriented than technology capacity oriented.

Further, to make the estimated efficiency scores from the two sub periods comparable, the study applies metafrontier frameworks proposed by O'Donnell et al. (2008) and Huang et al. (2014) to the cost function in the longitudinal setting. Estimates from both methods show that the average efficiency score of the electrical distribution sector during the whole sample period is relatively low. Further, findings also demonstrate that the efficiency levels after the regulatory reforms are lower than those before the regulatory reforms. To this surprising and unexpected phenomenon, we argue that cross-subsidization may be one reason for this kind of changing pattern in efficiency levels. In order to deal with the relatively low efficiency problem, we also suggest that Japanese regulators should introduce more incentive-based regulatory tools to replace the current rate-of-return regulation.","[Li, Hong-Zhou; Xiao, Xing-Zhi] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria] Univ Oulu, Thule Inst, Martti Ahtisaari Inst Global Business & Econ, Finnish Environm Inst, Oulu, Finland; [Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria] Univ Oulu, Dept Econ, Oulu, Finland; [Lau, Sim-Yee] Reitaku Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; University of Oulu; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Oulu,"Li, HZ (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, Dalian, Peoples R China.",hli@dufe.edu.cn; maria.kopsakangas@oulu.fi; 04110789@163.com; lau.simyee@gmail.com,,"Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria/0000-0003-2110-9307",Planning Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; National Science Council in China [71173032]; Academy of Finland Regulation and Dynamic pricing for Flexible Energy Systems (REDYFLEX-project) [AKA285944]; Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Large Scale Variable Distributed Energy Solution (BC-DC-project) [AKA292854],Planning Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; National Science Council in China; Academy of Finland Regulation and Dynamic pricing for Flexible Energy Systems (REDYFLEX-project); Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Large Scale Variable Distributed Energy Solution (BC-DC-project),"We are grateful for the financial support from the Planning Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China for Research in Humanities and Social Sciences (Theory and Application Research on the Incorporation of Inefficiency-improving Design into Cost-plus Regime), National Science Council in China (Grant no. 71173032), Academy of Finland Regulation and Dynamic pricing for Flexible Energy Systems (REDYFLEX-project AKA285944) and Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Large Scale Variable Distributed Energy Solution (BC-DC-project AKA292854).",,46,18,19,3,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,606,616,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.032,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800056,0

It brings to attention surplus capacity as a concept that could enrich discussions on what drivers Russia's energy policy abroad and how Moscow enhances its energy security. The article provides three explanations on Russia's surplus capacity for oil and gas exports. First, Russia's institutional setting has been conducive for a surge in new pipelines, as economic considerations have played a less significant role. Second, Russia's energy pivot to Asia has already contributed to a widening surplus capacity in westbound oil pipelines, and it is likely to have a similar impact on gas once it starts flowing to China. Third, Russia's energy security concerns, namely about minimising transit risks, have played a key role in its active pipeline diplomacy and new pipeline ventures. The implications of Russia's surplus capacity can be significant. For oil, the room for manoeuvring is wide enough to allow Russia abandon an entire route of its choice. For gas, Moscow is likely to enhance its bargaining position with Ukraine, while Gazprom acquires more flexibility to deliver gas abroad.","[Vatansever, Adnan] Kings Coll London, Kings Russia Inst, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Vatansever, A (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Kings Russia Inst, London WC2R 2LS, England.",adnan.vatansever@kcl.ac.uk,,"Vatansever, Adnan/0000-0002-2118-5847",,,,,64,28,31,0,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,1,11,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.038,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800001,0

Policy support plays a key role in promoting firms' investment in research and development (R & D) activities, especially in emerging sectors. Policy consistency increases technological competitiveness, since it encourages firms to invest in R & D activities. Although previous studies argue policy design and characteristics, few deal with policy consistency, and they lack a quantitative measure of policy consistency and explanation of its effects. Therefore, this study proposes the quantitative indexes for policy consistency and potential technological competitiveness. The indexes are applied to the case of renewable energy sector since energy sector is highly dependent on the government policy and thus needs high policy consistency. The result shows that renewable energy technology development is affected by policy and the higher the policy consistency especially in emerging sectors. It also shows that countries of high policy consistency tend to achieve higher technological competitiveness and thus are likely to secure higher technological competitiveness in the future. The findings of this study can be used in designing policy for sustainable technological competitiveness and will be a corner stone for researches on assessing policy consistency.","[Yoon, Jungsub; Oh, Yoonhwan; Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Oh, Yoonhwan] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Oh, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.;Oh, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",yhoh@snu.ac.kr,"Oh, Yoonhwan/B-5140-2014","Oh, Yoonhwan/0000-0003-4936-7287",,,,,50,16,19,6,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,425,434,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.013,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800040,0

The paper discusses four cases at different scales (local, subnational, regional and global) to highlight opportunities for introducing principles of energy justice into the core of business models of companies. By doing so, the paper offers a critical perspective on the potential of business model innovation to be guided through a more broadly defined understanding of value enhanced by concepts of energy justice. The discussion of the four case studies the Carbon Cooperative, Robin Hood Energy, RenEsco, and the Yansa Community Interest Company highlights the importance of creating supportive wider environments for social and business model innovations, such as the development of skills, knowledge and social capital, through interventions coming from multiple levels and focused on different aspects of energy generation, supply and use (i.e. finance and technical implementation). Going against the grain of current policy, the study implies a shift away from upscaling innovations by taking them to the national scale, and towards creating supportive conditions for more local deals in different geographic locations.","[Hiteva, Ralitsa] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin] Univ Sussex, CIED, SPRU, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Hiteva, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",R.Hiteva@sussex.ac.uk; B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403","International Centre for Infrastructure Futures grant - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council [EP/K012347/1]; Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant [EP/K011790/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1, EP/K012347/1] Funding Source: UKRI",International Centre for Infrastructure Futures grant - Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the International Centre for Infrastructure Futures grant, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Economic and Social Research Council [EP/K012347/1, 2013], as well as Research Councils United Kingdom (RCUK) Energy Program Grant [EP/K011790/1, 2013] Center on Innovation and Energy Demand.",,72,84,89,3,71,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,631,639,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.056,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200062,0

According to this theory, public and private agents lack sufficient foresight to make optimal economic decisions and become poor as a result. Using a panel of U.S. state-level data, this paper offers evidence to the contrary. Public spending on education in resource-rich states greatly exceeds that in resource-scarce ones, and private education services are imperfectly crowded out as a result. Analyzing a broader set of public education outcomes reveals that relative teacher salaries, public enrollment rates, and teacher-student ratios tend to move pro-cyclically with resource booms and busts. Weaker evidence is provided that graduation rates fall in response to resource booms, perhaps reflecting a rise in the opportunity cost of going to school for working-age students.

There are two implications of the current findings. The first is political in nature and involves the discussion of the best way to improve the provision of public services by utilities. From an economic, managerial and social approach, all the arrangements, whether public or private, should be rethought. The second implication is theoretical, since firm effects can be established based on the existence of superior resources, the key variable to explain differences in organizational performance.","[Silvestre, Hugo Consciencia] Univ Integracao Int Lusofonia Afrobrasileira UNIL, Ctr Policy & Publ Adm, Campus Liberdade,Ave Abolicao,3 Ctr, BR-62790000 Redencao, CE, Brazil; [Gomes, Ricardo Correa] Univ Brasilia, FACE, Campus Darcy Ribeiro,Modulo 25, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Silvestre, HC (通讯作者)，Univ Integracao Int Lusofonia Afrobrasileira UNIL, Ctr Policy & Publ Adm, Campus Liberdade,Ave Abolicao,3 Ctr, BR-62790000 Redencao, CE, Brazil.",hmcsilvestre@gmail.com; gomesric.rg@gmail.com,"Silvestre, Hugo C/D-6578-2017; Gomes, Ricardo/V-4450-2019; Gomes, Ricardo/AAY-4978-2020","Silvestre, Hugo C/0000-0001-7654-6577; Gomes, Ricardo/0000-0002-4164-5986;",,,,,53,6,6,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

To accomplish both of them, low-carbon technologies based on renewable energy and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are expected to gain importance. The objective of the present work is to support prospective Swiss energy policy-making by providing a detailed sustainability analysis of possible energy system transformation pathways. For this purpose, the results of the scenario quantification with an energy system model are coupled with multi-criteria sustainability analysis. Two climate protection and one reference scenario are addressed, and the trade-offs between the scenarios are analysed based on a set of 12 interdisciplinary indicators. Implementing a stringent climate policy in Switzerland is associated with co-benefits such as less fossil resource use, less fatalities in severe accidents in the energy sector, less societal conflicts and higher resource autonomy. The availability and implementation of CCS allows for achieving the GHG emission reduction target at lower costs, but at the expense of a more fossil fuel-based energy system.","[Volkart, Kathrin; Weidmann, Nicolas; Bauer, Christian; Hirschberg, Stefan] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Energy Syst Anal, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Weidmann, Nicolas] Univ Basel, Environm Econ, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; University of Basel,"Volkart, K (通讯作者)，Paul Scherrer Inst, OHSA E03, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",kathrin.volkart@psi.ch,,,Competence Centre of Environment and Sustainability (CCES); Competence Centre of Energy and Mobility (CCEM); Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Alstom Power Service; Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER SoE),Competence Centre of Environment and Sustainability (CCES); Competence Centre of Energy and Mobility (CCEM); Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Alstom Power Service; Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER SoE),"This work was carried out as part of the project CARMA and funded by the Competence Centres of Environment and Sustainability (CCES) and Energy and Mobility (CCEM), the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) and Alstom Power Service.

Little attention has yet been paid to the role of spillovers from neighbour regions for industrial diversification, nor has the role of network linkages between neighbour regions been investigated. As the spread of capabilities has a strong geographical bias, we expect regions to develop new industries in which their neighbour regions are specialized. To test this hypothesis, we analyse the development of new industries in US states during the period 2000-2012. We show that a US state has a higher probability of developing a comparative advantage in a new industry if a neighbour state is specialized in that industry. We also show that neighbour US states have more similar export structures. This export similarity seems to be explained by higher social connectivity between neighbour states, as embodied in their bilateral migration patterns.","[Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Heidelberglaan, NL-23584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Martin, Victor] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Martin, Victor] ICEI, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Minondo, Asier] Deusto Business Sch, Camino Mundaiz 5020012, San Sebastian, Spain; [Minondo, Asier] ICEI, Camino Mundaiz 5020012, San Sebastian, Spain",Lund University; Utrecht University; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Deusto,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.;Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Heidelberglaan, NL-23584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",Ron.Boschma@circle.lu.se; victor.martin@urjc.es; aminondo@deusto.es,"Martin, Victor/ABG-3718-2020; Minondo, Asier/G-1769-2015","Martin, Victor/0000-0003-2001-7283; Minondo, Asier/0000-0001-8566-1278","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MINECO ECO2013-46980-P, HAR2013-40760_R]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (FEDER); Basque Government Department of Education, Language policy and Culture [IT629-13]; European Union [320131]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (FEDER)(Spanish Government); Basque Government Department of Education, Language policy and Culture; European Union(European Union (EU))","We thank the comments and suggestions by Jacob Holm and other participants at the 2nd Workshop on Industrial Relatedness and Regional Change (Umea University), and participants in Universidad Complutense de Madrid Research Seminar.

In this paper, we use the partition of ethnic groups as a natural experiment in order to estimate the effect of the share of these ethnic groups on development. We show that larger groups have an advantage in terms of development and that the partition in itself does not matter for development. This result is explained by the fact that the partition matters only when the resulting groups are relatively small, since their lack of political representation may weaken support for institutions, may bias policies and the provision of ethnic/regional public goods.","[Dimico, Arcangelo] Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, 185 Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Dimico, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, 185 Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.dimico@qub.ac.uk,"Dimico, Arcangelo/AAI-1536-2020",,,,,,101,5,5,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Under our benchmark assumptions the permanent-income rule requires a permanent tightening of the fiscal stance by 4.6%-points of GDP. Delaying it by a decade implies that the fiscal stance needs to be tightened by a further 0.9%-point. This benchmark optimal policy ensures that depletion of oil and gas wealth is matched by an equal increase in above-ground financial wealth. Its merits are highlighted by comparing it with the tougher alternative of the bird-in hand rule and with projecting the current fiscal stance. If oil and gas revenue rises by a half due to higher prices or more discoveries, the fiscal stance needs to be tightened by only 3.2%-points of GDP. However, if a large chunk of oil and gas has to be kept in the soil to meet international agreements to keep global warming below 2 degrees C, the permanent transfer drops to 2.0% of GDP and the fiscal stance needs to be tightened by 5.5%-points of GDP.","[Malova, Aleksandra; van der Ploeg, Frederick] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, OXCARRE, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",Saint Petersburg State University; University of Oxford,"van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, OXCARRE, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",a.malova@spbu.ru; rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,"Friedl, Aleksandra/J-5370-2013","Friedl, Aleksandra/0000-0002-5287-0169",St. Petersburg State University Laboratory Economic performance and the environment; BP funded Oxford Centre,St. Petersburg State University Laboratory Economic performance and the environment; BP funded Oxford Centre,"We acknowledge support from the St. Petersburg State University Laboratory Economic performance and the environment and the BP funded Oxford Centre for the Analysis of Resource Rich Economies.

These schemes were designed to drive deployment on the basis of specific subsidies sustained in time to allow for the larger costs as well as to limit investor risk. While these policies have proven to be effective, the way they have been designed to date has led to costly market distortions that are becoming more difficult to ignore as penetrations reach unpreceded levels. In the context of this growing concern, we provide a critical analysis of the design elements of RES-E support schemes, focusing on how they affect this trade-off between promoting and efficiently integrating RES-E. The emphasis is on the structure of the incentive payment, which in the end turns to be the cornerstone for an efficient integration. We conclude that, while needed, a well-designed and further developed capacity-based support mechanism complemented with ex-post compensations defined for reference benchmark plants, such as the mechanism currently implemented in Spain, is an alternative with good properties if the major goal is truly market integration.

Though some of these policies have resulted in substantial progress toward their goals, the effects of these efforts on other social and environmental externalities are often ignored. In this study, we examine the life-cycle air pollutant emissions for alternative fuel and vehicle purchase scenarios at a military installation near a typical urban area in the United States (U.S.). We find that scenarios which minimize petroleum use or greenhouse gas emissions do not concomitantly minimize criteria air pollutant emissions. We also employ social cost methodologies to quantify economic externalities due to climate change and health-related air pollutant impacts. Accounting for the social costs of climate change and air pollution from vehicle use reveals that criteria air pollutants may have a greater total impact than greenhouse gas emissions in locations similar to the urban area examined in this study. Use of first-generation biofuels, particularly corn grain ethanol, may reduce net petroleum use at the cost of increased total health impacts. More comprehensive policies may be needed to ensure that sustainability policies result in a net benefit to society.","[Emery, Isaac; Mbonimpa, Eric; Thal, Alfred E., Jr.] Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Management, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA",Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT),"Mbonimpa, E (通讯作者)，Air Force Inst Technol, Dept Syst Engn & Management, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.",eric.mbonimpa@afit.edu,"Emery, Isaac/G-6601-2011","Emery, Isaac/0000-0002-8757-2698",Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) funds; U.S. Department of Energy; AFIT,Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) funds; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); AFIT,"This research was supported by Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) funds, and by an appointment to the Postgraduate Research Participation Program at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and AFIT.

In all stages the stock is closed-loop controlled to a nominal stock. Therefore the only decision which can be made in the entire supply chain is the quantity of an order. In a first simulation run a suitable order strategy will be defined. Good results can be realized, if an order is splitted up in two: A customers order and a stock order.

Railroad restructuring in many countries has led to separate infrastructure management. Infrastructure operators therefore should consider growing requirements of operating companies. To meet their requirements, infrastructure managers must continuously optimize operational and maintenance costs. Into budget planning they must include growing requirements for the reliability and availability of infrastructure as well as crucial issue - the traffic safety. The experiences of operating systems show that often engineering system ownership cost is many times greater than the cost of its acquisition. Therefore, today, in the global economy purchasing decisions of many technical systems, especially those expensive are not taken on the basis of preliminary acquisition costs. One of the methods, which is able to support right investment decisions-making is Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis. It is suitable to determine the costs of the whole life cycle of the system, i.e. the costs of acquisition, operation and liquidation. Thus, it allows to minimize investment risk because it includes total calculation for each option and not just the initial investment costs. In the article the considerations will be conducted in relation to life-cycle cost for rail control systems. In their case, this is the part of recommended for use with this kind of system RAMS/LCC analysis.

Hiring and firing regulation and employment protection and legislation indicators increase the productivity of capital which has positive effects on regional investment.","[Escriba-Perez, Javier; Jose Murgui-Garcia, Maria] Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Campus Tarongers, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Murgui-García, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Anal Econ, Campus Tarongers, Valencia, Spain.",Francisco.j.escriba@uv.es; Maria.j.murgui@uv.es,"Murgui-Garcia, Maria Jose/H-1617-2015","Murgui-Garcia, Maria Jose/0000-0003-2712-1278",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) from the Spanish Ministry of Economia and Financial Affairs; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2015-65049-C2-1-P],European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) from the Spanish Ministry of Economia and Financial Affairs(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for project 'Economia Regional, Cohesion Territorial y Politicas Publicas' from the Spanish Ministry of Economia and Financial Affairs.

An Analysis of the Period 1976-2010,REVISTA DE HISTORIA INDUSTRIAL,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Argentina; deindustrialization; reindustrialization,LATIN-AMERICA; ECONOMY; POLICY,"This paper examines the process of deindustrialization in Argentina and analyses the main consequences. The period examined can be broken down into two dissimilar phases: 1976-2002, and 2003-present day. From 1976 to 2002, Argentina's economy experienced unusual volatility leading to serious deterioration of key socio-economic variables. This period was marked by the implementation of a pro-market agenda aimed at stimulating quick external opening, an accelerated appreciation of the local currency, and widespread deregulation of domestic markets. Within this context, Argentina suffered a surprisingly intense and extensive process of deindustrialization. Starting in 2003, under a new political and economic context, this downward trend in industry was interrupted. Nevertheless, the structural regression resulting from the previous period left a pronounced mark. Consequently, Argentina's industrial structure is characterized by high concentration, an unbalanced productive framework, and local sector specialization geared towards producing undifferentiated goods.","[Herrera Bartis, German] Univ Nacl Quilmes, Bernal, Buenos Aires, Argentina",,"Bartis, GH (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Quilmes, Bernal, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,3,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Thanks to coexistence companies can use shared environment (to combine sources, create common results, use benefits, etc) to gain an edge on the market. Strategic alliances, as one type of cooperation, are the efficient tool for creating long-term sustainability of the company. The focus of this paper is to analyse the environment of strategic alliances. The reason why we decided to choose this area of research problematics is the general known assumption that the company which does not have implemented an efficient working strategy cannot be successful in current competitive world. After discussing theoretical background of strategic alliances authors suggest the decision-making model for creating and sustaining a strategic alliance. The model is based on the idea that when evaluating an alliance, it is not important how long does it last, but the most important fact is whether it fulfils expectations from partners are met. Except for this, authors also define problem areas in creating and efficient working of these alliances. By applying the proposed model there is an assumption of creating the synergy, synergistic effect and increased competitiveness of the company.","[Holubcik, Martin; Dubovec, Juraj] Univ Zilina, Dept Management Theories, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia; [Falat, Lukas] Univ Zilina, Dept Macro & Microecon, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Falát, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Dept Macro & Microecon, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia.",martin.holubcik@fri.uniza.sk; lukas.falat@fri.uniza.sk; juraj.dubovec@fri.uniza.sk,"Falat, Lukas/GXM-8404-2022; Holubčík, Martin/AAE-9480-2021; Dubovec, Juraj/AAZ-1607-2021","Falat, Lukas/0000-0002-2597-7059; Holubčík, Martin/0000-0002-5200-2441; Dubovec, Juraj/0000-0003-3626-5011",Slovak Republic scientific grants [VEGA 1/0617/16],Slovak Republic scientific grants,This work was supported by the Slovak Republic scientific grants VEGA 1/0617/16.,,23,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,693,700,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201024,0

This paper addresses the challenge of how to characterise in quantitative terms the complex and fast-changing phenomenon of informal urban settlements without falling into oversimplification and a narrow focus on the material deficits of informal settlements. Energy policies are taken as an example to illustrate the shortcomings of oversimplification in producing policy relevant information. We adopt a semantically open representation of informal settlements that can capture the diversity of adaptive strategies used by different settlement typologies, based on the societal metabolism approach. Results show that as settlements grow in size and complexity, they remain economically and politically marginalised and fail to integrate into the city. We argue that in the case of energy policy, the analysis must go beyond the definition of problems such as access to energy at the level of the individual, and focus on a multi-scale assessment including the household and community levels studying the capacity of the household to increase it energy throughput through exosomatic devices and infrastructure.

The introductory part of the article is devoted to the definition of a global brand and the characteristics of its essential features. Key attributes of successful global brand management (GBM) that have been formulated on the basis of studying and analysing of a number of domestic and foreign studies, scientific articles and author ' s views on this issue are identified in the following part. These contentions are verified on a sample of the most important global brands, which are placed annually at the top of the ranks of the most valuable brands made by prestigious consulting companies. The space is also devoted to the characteristics of basic global brand strategies, advantages and disadvantages of applying of global brands and brand portfolio diversification. These attributes are largely determined by specific conditions of environment in which the global brand is applied (industry, competitive environment, target groups, economic environment, etc.). Despite the specific and changing conditions of global markets, the contribution includes attributes of GBM that can be considered as universal and at present undeniable. A successful brand in the domestic market is not a prerequisite of success in global markets. The primary aim of the article is identification of attributes of successful global brand. It can be assumed that GBM will be ineffective without accepting and correctly applying these attributes.","[Kral, Pavol; Janoskova, Katarina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kral, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",pavol.kral@fpedas.uniza.sk; katarina.janoskova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kral, Pavol/P-3291-2015; Janoskova, Katarina/P-3277-2015",,[APVV-15-0505],,This paper is an outcome of project APVV-15-0505: Integrated model of management support for building and managing the brand value in the specific conditions of the Slovak Republic.,,25,0,0,1,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1161,1168,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202016,0

Based on the human capital theory we can expect that language skills should have a positive impact on productivity and earnings. This should be the case both for those working domestically and those working aborad. Our purpose is to determine whether language skills have an impact on the earnings of Poles. The Poles seem to be a good case for this type of analysis, because the Polish language is not used for international communication, while as much as 58% of Poles declare to command at least one foreign language and 5% of Poles earn their income abroad. We estimated an extended Mincer wage equation using OLS and the Heckman correction for self-selection to employment. The analysis was based on data from three waves (2012-2014) of the Human Capital Balance survey with a pooled sample of about 35,000 individuals. Analysis shows that the command of foreign languages has a strong, positive impact on earnings. The wage premium from the advanced command of a foreign language amounts to 6% in case of employment in Poland and 22% for those working abroad. Interestingly, those working in Poland earn a much higher wage premium from proficiency in Spanish (29%), Italian (20%) or French (19%) than from proficiency in English (8%). In turn, English is the only foreign language which brings a wage premium to Poles working abroad.","[Liwinski, Jacek] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Liwinski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",jacek.liwinski@wp.pl,"Liwiński, Jacek/H-3350-2018","Liwiński, Jacek/0000-0002-3572-2973",,,,,18,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1331,1338,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202037,0

Agriculture and food production, which is directly connected with the development of rural areas, is significantly influenced. Due to the import dependency of agri-food commodities and intensification of agricultural production, the decreasing of workplaces is observed in many countries, inter alia Latvia. The paper examines this impact on sustainability and resilience of rural areas, where the well-being of rural population has been chosen as the object of the study. The importance of sustainable development and resilience of the rural areas as well as the rural communities is widely accepted. The evaluation of the main issues or constraints and challenges of assuring the sustainability of rural areas was performed. Some indicators such as population density, poverty rate, unemployment rate, income level and other wellbeing indicators have been used for comparing the rural areas and urban areas in the Latvia, as well as for evaluating the trends among the Baltic States. The results of study suggest that the difference between rural and urban area inhabitants well-being still stay unequal. Moreover, the findings show that the well-being indicators have the lowest values in Latvia among the Baltic States. Although many of Rural Development Program measures are aimed to the support of job creation in rural areas, the projected results have not been met. The number of creating jobs is less than planned and created jobs, in most cases, requires low qualification, and therefore also with low pay.","[Melece, Ligita] Inst Agr Resources & Econ, Struktoru Iela 14, LV-1039 Riga, Latvia",Institute of Agricultural Resources & Economics,"Melece, L (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Resources & Econ, Struktoru Iela 14, LV-1039 Riga, Latvia.",ligita.melece@arei.lv,,,"National Research Program,Innovation and Sustainable Development(SUSTINNO)","National Research Program,Innovation and Sustainable Development(SUSTINNO)","This study is funded by the National Research Program,Innovation and Sustainable Development(SUSTINNO).",,24,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1540,1548,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202062,0

From that, successful and failure in implementing G4 guidelines can be revealed. The research focuses on real cases of six Czech firms that comply with G4 in 2014 and 2015. The research firstly examines the guidelines content for identifying material aspects. Then, these companies' sustainable reports are observed to investigate how firms define and disclose material aspects. Comparison in determining sustainable measures between companies' preparation and guidelines, and between companies in different sectors are performed to provide better understanding for implementing GRI guides in corporations for other companies. After the evaluation, the paper found that even though all firms declared that they are in accordance with G4, the quality of information is not consistent. Only one firm had proper disclosure while these other fives totally neglected the guidelines, or just applied some main standard disclosures according to G4 guidelines regarding to this subject.","[Nguyen Thi Thuc Doan] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Sidlisti 1 151, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Doan, NTT (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Sidlisti 1 151, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",doanntt@buh.edu.vn,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-654-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,227,238,,10.7441/dokbat.2017.24,0.0,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6FF,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466528800024,0

Important conclusions can be drawn after the study of financial and economic activities of individual industries and sectors of the Russian economy. A significant role was played by an overview of global trends in the financial management policies of large international corporations. The article shows the interrelation of sustainable development, sustainable growth and corporate financial policy. Coherence of objectives and effective results can be obtained using a common financial and organizational control mechanism. The article describes the elements of the financial mechanism, which is currently used by large corporations in the real sector of the Russian economy. The subjects of financial management often has difficulty making decisions in adverse financial conditions (significant systematic risks). In terms of Finance is inflation, high cost of raising capital for investment in real and financial assets, low return on equity.

As a first result, we illustrate the singularity of the Asociacion, which was more than a mere transposition of the Free-Trade Congress of Brussels in 1856. Secondly, we call into question the traditional vision of an Asociacion where different political parties live in harmony. Finally, we show how the temporary disappearance of the Asociacion in 1869 was not caused by its satisfaction with the Figuerola bill but rather by the division that this bill created among the supporters of free-trade because of its gradualism and fiscal duties.","[Serrano Sanz, Jose Maria] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Sanz, JMS (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,3,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

In this process, the coating material TEFLON is used to spray to cover all the part's surface. If a pot or pan is not too deep, one spray gun is enough to spray to cover all the interior surface. However, for the high side-wall pot, two spray guns must be used to spray at two different areas. The first area is at the bottom and its corner. The second area is around the top rim of the pot or pan. Note that the spray pattern is of fan-type. Thus, the sprayed area will be covered by the mentioned two spray guns. Consequently, the large amount of coating material is consumed to meet the dry film thickness (DFT) requirement. In this paper, the optimization of spray coating process is studied aiming to minimize the material usage. The experimental design technique is applied to determine the optimal spray coating parameters. The parameters used in this study include angle, spray time, fan pattern, and air pressure.

Such a world can then be used to control processes, especially when the space of a virtual world is created from quantities obtained in the real world. The huge importance of creating a virtual world from quantities that we have long been storing lies in the fact that one glance, one flight over the surface of such a world is sufficient to get an overview of the behavior of ultra-large-scale systems with a number of monitored quantities.

Capital construction industry produces industrial facilities as well as non-production assets that are commissioned and accepted under established formal procedures and, as they become fully operational, are transformed into tangible fixed assets (Minstroy of Russia, 2015; Borisova et al., 2016). It is obvious that construction plays an important role in the economy, especially in a developing one, where the need for creating new real estate objects is significant (Zou et al., 2007; PMR Industry Report, 2016; Vertakova, Y. et al., 2015; Polozhentseva, Yu., 2016; Terzi & Cavalieri, 2004). The construction sector is a complex interconnected system that encompasses the following types of entities: building contractors and specialized construction companies, producers of construction supplies and transportation aids, survey, research and design organizations, educational institutions, raw and construction materials exchanges, engineering, consulting, managerial and other firms and other formations focusing on the construction industry, including industry governance bodies and industry non-governmental organizations (Birbkov, 2012). Either directly or indirectly, enterprises from over seventy branches of the national economy are involved in the sphere of capital construction, ensuring supplies of metal and steelwork, concrete, timber, construction tools and specialized vehicles, as well as fuel and energy resources, to construction sites. One of the most prominent processes characteristic of the current situation in Russia's construction industry is fierce competition among owners of capital who are essentially interchangeable, occurring at all stages of construction. It should also be noted that globalization affects construction inasmuch as it does other branches of the economy (Neumann, 2015; Volkova & Plotnikov, 2016; Grechenyuk et al., 2016; Beno, 2016; Cuhlova & Kotikova, 2016).

Another aim is to improve financial management of a company, by suitable tools of financial controlling that will develop effective management of a company.","[Zlamalova, Jana] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Zlámalová, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",jzlamalova@fame.utb.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,17,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-654-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,337,346,,10.7441/dokbat.2017.36,0.0,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6FF,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466528800036,0

Biofuel policies play an important role in ethanol production, consumption, and investment in processing capacity. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of how current policies affect the evolution of the market is lacking. We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model to analyze the impact of different blend mandates and taxes levied on gasoline, hydrous, and anhydrous ethanol on investment in processing capacity and on production and consumption of ethanol. The model uses land use projections by the PCRaster Land Use Change model and incorporates the institutions governing the actors' strategic decision making with regard to production and consumption of ethanol, and the institutions governing the interaction among actors. From the investigated mix of policy measures, we find that an increase of the gasoline tax leads to the highest increased investments in sugarcane processing capacity. We also find that a gasoline tax above 1.23 R$/1 and a tax exemption for hydrous ethanol may lead to doubling the production of ethanol by 2030 (relative to 2016).","[Moncada, J.

This study uses a simple model to analyze the optimal timing of the clean-ups, their size and the optimal order to clean the sites. A waiting rule is derived, which implies that it is generally not optimal to clean a site immediately but to delay the cleaning, and that information solely on the pollution damages and clean-up costs is not sufficient to decide the optimal clean-up order. The results are discussed in the context of exhaustible resource production, mining legacy, radioactive waste containment and brownfield development. For example, the results indicate that if it is optimal to delay the clean-up, the optimal deposit by the exhaustible resource producer to the rehabilitation fund will be inversely related to the initial pollution level of the site and will be less than the cost of rehabilitation.

In this paper, the feasible generalized least square method is used to investigate the consumption of natural gas and the per capita natural gas consumption of urban residents in 30 provinces in China (not including central heating and the natural gas consumption of natural gas vehicles). We study the factors influencing natural gas consumption by urban residents in China and conduct scenario forecasting. The empirical results show that the impact coefficients of PNGs and household income on average natural gas consumption are - 0.895 and 0.222, respectively, while the impact coefficients of the NGP are - 0.603 and 0.346, respectively. The scenario forecast results show that the consumption of natural gas in Chinese households reached 75.469 billion cubic meters in 2025. China's natural gas season peak pressure will continue to increase. In response to this, the following three suggestions are proposed. (1) According to the price elasticity of natural gas, the Chinese government should adjust and improve the mechanism for the formation of PNGs for residents and promote the marketization of natural gas. (2) Accelerate the construction of natural gas reserves and allocate the natural gas supply according to regional differences in natural gas consumption to enhance China's natural gas peak shaving capacity. (3) Improve and optimize natural gas development plans to achieve coordinated development of natural gas supply and demand.","[Liu, Guixian; Dong, Xiucheng; Dong, Cong; Li, Jiaman] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiucheng; Jiang, Qingzhe] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; University of International Business & Economics,"Dong, XC (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",xiuchengdong@163.com,,"dong, xiucheng/0000-0002-4597-0356",,,,,60,66,68,10,127,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,17,26,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.016,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700003,0

Several key aspects are considered in depth, such as the developments in natural gas production in the Russian Arctic, important trends and strategies of major Asian LNG-consuming countries, and the geographical and climatic particularities of the Arctic. The analysis reveals the competitiveness of Russian LNG exports along the Northeast Passage due to Yamal LNG, which could be a game-changer for global LNG supplies. We further find that an ice-free NEP is primarily relevant for maritime bulk, and particularly LNG, shipping, and thus of great geopolitical importance and strategic interest, especially for Russia and the US on the supply side, and China, Japan, and South Korea on the demand side. The political relevance of the Arctic is becoming more lucid, because the retreating ice creates possibilities for the development of hydrocarbons but also fosters strategic and military considerations of the littoral countries.","[Schach, Michael] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Madlener, Reinhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; E-ON,"Madlener, R (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,Verbundnetz Gas AG,Verbundnetz Gas AG,The first author would like to gratefully acknowledge financial research support of the Verbundnetz Gas AG.,,56,20,24,5,92,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,438,448,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.009,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700041,0

In doing so, they will contribute greatly to a shift in household and community energy use from reliance on traditional fuels to more modern energy services. However, such a shift is a complex and uncertain process, with mini-grids often struggling to achieve sustainability after initial project funding ends. This paper draws on service design approaches to understand challenges associated with adoption of electricity services from the user perspective. By developing a user journey map, our study explores users' experience associated with connecting to and using electricity services from a 60 kW solar mini-grid in Mpanta, a small rural fishing community in northern Zambia. Our study finds that poor expectation management and limited integration of local socioeconomic dynamics in mini-grid service design, including their impact on affordability, has led to a slow and partial shift in household energy use. Better incorporation of the user perspective in the design, implementation and evaluation of mini-grids can help to identify potential barriers to adoption of electricity services and adapt it to the local context.","[Muhoza, Cassilde] World Agroforestry Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, UN Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Johnson, Oliver W.] Stockholm Environm Inst, 15th Floor,Witthayakit Bldg,254 Chulalongkorn Soi, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Johnson, OW (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, 15th Floor,Witthayakit Bldg,254 Chulalongkorn Soi, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",cassilde.muhoza@sei.org; oliver.johnson@sei.org,,,"Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida); Centre for Energy, Environment and Engineering Zambia (CEEEZ); Rural Electrification Authority of Zambia (REA)","Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida); Centre for Energy, Environment and Engineering Zambia (CEEEZ); Rural Electrification Authority of Zambia (REA)","This project was funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida).

Scenario analyses and case study were applied to illustrate the results, which show five basic conclusions. 1) Low-carbon development doesn't require eliminating energy consumption completely during urbanization 2) The average level of urbanization is relatively low owing to the large disparities among provinces and the provinces' economic development. Though the development of low-carbon in the 30 provinces is generally rapid, the gap between the highest provinces and the lowest provinces is relatively large because of their different socio-economic features. 3) Much more attention should be paid to CO2 emissions per capita. The quality of public social service,the basic and medical insurance coverage for the elderly, the community service coverage in infrastructure and the green design during urban construction should be improved. 4) The coordination of CUS is closely related to the different development stages and geographic locations of each province. 5) For different types of provinces with different degrees of coupling coordination,there is a need to explore different development directions.","[Song, Qijiao; Liu, Tianle; Qi, Ye] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Song, Qijiao] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Management, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Nan; Siehr, Stephanie A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Environm Energy Technol Div, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Dept, China Energy Grp, Berkeley, CA USA; [Siehr, Stephanie A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",Tsinghua University; Capital Normal University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Qi, Y (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qi@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Liu, Tianle/0000-0003-4995-8781",,,,,15,166,171,59,330,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,346,354,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.037,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800035,0

But meeting temperature targets within defined timelines as agreed under the Paris Agreement requires more than incremental improvements: it requires achieving net zero emissions within a few decades. To date, there is little evidence that carbon pricing has produced deep emission reductions, even at high prices. While much steeper carbon prices may deliver greater abatement, political economy constraints render their feasibility doubtful. An approach with multiple instruments, including technology mandates and targeted support for innovation, is indispensable to avoid path dependencies and lock-in of long-lived, high-carbon assets. We argue that carbon pricing serves several important purposes in such an instrument mix, but also that the global commitment to deep decarbonisation requires acknowledging the vital role of instruments other than carbon pricing.","[Tvinnereim, Endre] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Mehling, Michael] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Tvinnereim, E (通讯作者)，Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",endre.tvinnereim@uni.no; mmehling@mit.edu,"Tvinnereim, Endre/AFQ-8791-2022","Tvinnereim, Endre/0000-0001-8891-2503","Research Council of Norway [261603, 268056]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We acknowledge funding from the Research Council of Norway, grants no. 261603 and 268056.

The results underscore the need for investment geared towards local generation particularly in large hydro up to 0.22 GW, PV up to and 1.1 GW and pumped storage up to 0.5 GW by 2050, to keep up with future demand and reduce the cost of imported electricity in the country. Succinctly, the investigation reveals, inter-alia, that: 1) Lesotho's energy demand will continue to increase over the modelled period (up to 2050), with the gap between the local generation and demand concomitantly increasing; 2) large hydro generation, if harnessed will guarantee long-term energy security and cheaper energy relative to both imports and small hydro; 3) any shift in the energy policies of external suppliers at current tariff structures, will increase Lesotho's energy costs significantly, thus, negatively impacting on the country's economy; and 4) investing in local energy generation will guarantee long-term national energy security and affordability.","[Senatla, Mamahloko] CSIR, Energy Ctr, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa; [Nchake, Mamello] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Econ, Roma 180, Lesotho; [Taele, Benedict M.] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Phys & Elect, Roma 180, Lesotho; [Hapazari, Innocent] Natl Univ Lesotho, Dept Chem & Chem Technol, Roma 180, Lesotho; [Nchake, Mamello] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa",Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; University of Cape Town,"Senatla, M (通讯作者)，CSIR, Energy Ctr, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa.",msenatla@gmail.com; mnchake@gmail.com; bm.taele@nul.ls; i.hapazari@nul.ls,"Nchake, Mamello/AAR-2032-2021; Senatla, Mamahloko/W-5024-2019; Hapazari, Innocent/O-9843-2019","Senatla, Mamahloko/0000-0002-1640-6123; NCHAKE, MAMELLO AMELIA/0000-0001-5028-3270",,,,,44,15,15,2,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,622,634,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.003,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300058,0

However, we also document a secular trend of deconcentration over three decades, even in knowledge-intensive industries. By constructing counterfactual distributions, we show that the underlying mechanisms differ across sectors. Dispersion of manufacturing industries is driven by closing or contracting plants within industrial agglomerations, while dispersion of the service sector is fostered by the creation of new plants.","[Dauth, Wolfgang] Univ Wurzburg, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Dauth, Wolfgang] IAB Nuremberg, Nurnberg, Germany; [Fuchs, Michaela] IAB Sachsen Anhalt Thueringen, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Otto, Anne] IAB Rheinland Pfalz Saarland, Saarbrucken, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Dauth, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.;Dauth, W (通讯作者)，IAB Nuremberg, Nurnberg, Germany.",wolfgang.dauth@uni-wuerzburg.de; Michaela.Fuchs@iab.de; Anne.Otto@iab.de,,"Dauth, Wolfgang/0000-0002-4269-6910",,,,,59,7,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Yet efforts to optimise diversification have thus far failed to account for important empirical evidence on habit-driven water demand. To resolve this disconnect, an intertemporal optimisation model is developed to generate a supply portfolio that weights alternative sources of water according to the uncertainty of inflows, supply costs and habit formation. The model demonstrates that failure to account for habit-driven consumption leads to sup-optimal water infrastructure investments with too much emphasis on risky, weather-dependent sources, while weather-independent sources with guaranteed supply are underemphasised. Importantly, the optimal share of safe sources depends critically on how sensitive habit formation is to supply shocks. This implies that the benefits of policies targeting water saving behaviours and investments during periods of low supply extend beyond water conservation to more cost-effective supply portfolios. Empirical results demonstrate the importance of accommodating habit-driven demand within optimal diversification strategies. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Tanzania's natural gas reserves are estimated at 57 trillion cubic feet and the emergence of gas revenues are expected to be a strong economic growth factor for the country. To be sustainable, this economic growth should be inclusive and should result from balanced investments between technical, human, environmental, and social capital. We investigate household perceptions of Tanzania's nascent natural gas industry and operations. We implemented field surveys in the Mtwara and Lindi regions, regions that will be most directly impacted by the natural gas exploration and extraction owing to their proximity to the discovery sites. 783 respondents were interviewed for the quantitative survey and 20 for the qualitative one. We provide an overview of their awareness, and knowledge of local natural gas activities, and explore their perceptions from the economic, environmental, social, and governance perspectives. Finally, we draw on our findings and offer recommendations for implementing socially inclusive and sustainable policies in the gas sector in Tanzania, in line with the principles of sustainable development, licence to operate, corporate social responsibility and community engagement.","[Nkolo, J.

The impact of technology transfer is evaluated along four dimensions: capital goods and equipment, direct skill transfer, indirect skill transfer, and knowledge and expertise. In recent years, rise of south-south technology transfer led by Chinese-financed overseas renewable energy projects in developing countries has rekindled debate on motivations and impacts of China's increasing engagements. However, the literature on impact of technology transfer in renewable energy is scarce and non comparative in nature. This paper aims to fill in the gap. Through interviews with key stakeholders and detailed analysis of the negotiation and construction processes in both projects, the research shows although HydroChina shared a higher level of knowledge and expertise to local engineers and university scholars during the construction phase, Vergnet formed stronger long-term skill transfer linkages with local university students and employed a larger share of local workers than HydroChina. It is crucial to note the research presented here shows that host government, rather than donor country, has considerable capacity and can play a vital role in negotiating and maximizing technology transfer. In fact, the host government's expectations and demands contributed to the variations in technology transfer patterns. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential opportunities and challenges, and policy recommendations to facilitate international technology transfer.","[Chen, Yanning] Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitre Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Chen, Yanning] 2701 Connecticut Ave NW,Apt 301, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Chen, YN (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitre Sch Adv Int Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Chen, YN (通讯作者)，2701 Connecticut Ave NW,Apt 301, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",ychen282@jhu.edu,,,China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins Paul H.

Wind project development in forested areas has an unpreventable impact on nature, namely deforestation. The felling of trees is carried out to free space for the wind turbine installation and potentially also to increase the performance of the wind turbine and lower the levelized cost of energy. This study examines the impact of such a felling strategy, including the environmental and social consequences of deforestation. Based on a case study carried out in Sweden, this research study develops the first socio-technical framework for examining the consequences of deforestation. The deliverables of this research include recommendations for wind industry and forest industry stakeholders on how to apply deforestation in future development of wind projects in forested areas in Northern Europe. In addition, the framework is expected to encourage academia to further develop and analyze the socio-technical parameters associated with wind project development in forested areas.","[Enevoldsen, Peter] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Energy Technol, Herning, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Enevoldsen, P (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus BSS, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",peterenevoldsen@btech.au.dk,,"Enevoldsen, Peter/0000-0001-6684-7747",,,,,42,12,13,3,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,138,147,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.007,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800015,0

We studied these antecedents at a local level by analyzing a sample of 727 middle and large German municipalities using instrumental variables regression. Our results indicate that policymakers should focus on building local knowledge related to RES for local actors and with enhancing public-private cooperation activities. However, we did not find that locational factors such as direct incentives and energy and emissions reductions have a direct impact on RES. We suggest that these locational factors can provide indirect support for RES, as a starting point for the implementation of other policy criteria which we investigated in our study. Our findings also indicate greater RES development potential when policymakers adopt a facilitator role and support local innovation networks among different actors rather than keeping RES development activities within the municipality itself. In such an innovation network, stakeholders from non-municipality public and private institutions offer additional support to develop a local RES.","[Frank, Alejandro German; Paslauski, Carolline Amaral; Lerman, Laura Visintainer; Ayala, Nestor Fabian] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ind Engn, NEO, Org Engn Grp, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Gersdberger, Wolfgang] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Mkt & Management, Ctr Integrat Innovat Management, Odense, Denmark",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; University of Southern Denmark,"Frank, AG (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Escola Engn, Ave Osvaldo Aranha 99 Sala LOPP 508 5 Andar, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",frank@producao.ufrgs.br,"Frank, Alejandro G./AAH-9981-2021; Ayala, Néstor Fabián/AAK-3803-2021; Gerstlberger, Wolfgang/Y-9166-2019","Frank, Alejandro G./0000-0001-5041-6467; Ayala, Néstor Fabián/0000-0001-8888-9227; Gerstlberger, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6200-5737",European Union; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [CNPq PQ 305844/2015-6]; Brazilian Federal Ministry of Education (CAPES),European Union(European Union (EU)); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian Federal Ministry of Education (CAPES),"We carried out this study partly within INTERREG 4A, Southern Denmark / Schleswig-K.E.R.N. - European Regional Development Fund of the European Commission, financed by the European Union.

We first present a theoretical framework to determine the factors that explain households' energy consumption and highlight the motivations underlying their transition towards less polluting sources, including their environmental preference. Using French household data from ADEME, we provide an econometric test of qualitative variables following studies by Dubin and McFadden (1984). Our results show that income and prices are the main determinants of household energy consumption. Environmental considerations seem to influence the choice of energy sources more than consumption.

In consistence with economic theory, we estimate changes in household welfare, inequality, and social welfare resulting from different reforms. First, we find that an additional tax on conventional fuel is regressive. However, returning the additional tax revenue via lump-sum transfers can alleviate this effect. Second, when the additional revenue is also used to finance subsidies for electrical and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, households that own such vehicles experience welfare gains. However, this policy also increases income inequality and decreases social welfare. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Reanos, Miguel A.

Since conception, the economic viability of vehicle-to-grid operations has been the subject of debate. A common shortcoming of most of the previous studies has been a proper accounting of Lithium-ion battery degradation in the development of business models. Very recently, papers on the viability of V2G were published for which the detailed account of battery degradation resulted in what appeared to be two ostensibly contradictory conclusions. In this paper, the authors of these two major studies jointly reconcile their previous conclusions by providing clarity on how methodologies to manage battery degradation can reliably extend battery life. The paper also reviews the associated technology and policy implications of better managing battery use in vehicle and electrical grid applications.","[Uddin, Kotub] Univ Warwick, Int Digital Lab, WMG, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Dubarry, Matthieu; Glick, Mark B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Nat Energy Inst, SOEST, 1680 East West Rd,POST 109, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Warwick; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Uddin, K (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Int Digital Lab, WMG, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",k.uddin@warwick.ac.uk,"Dubarry, Matthieu/B-4333-2012","Dubarry, Matthieu/0000-0002-3228-1834","EPSRC [EP/M507143/1, EP/N001745/1]; WMG's staff development fund; state of Hawaii; ONR Asia Pacific Research Initiative for Sustainable Energy Systems (APRISES) [N00014-13-1-0463]; EPSRC [EP/N001745/1, EP/M507143/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N001745/1, EP/M507143/1] Funding Source: researchfish",EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); WMG's staff development fund; state of Hawaii; ONR Asia Pacific Research Initiative for Sustainable Energy Systems (APRISES); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"KU is supported by EPSRC grants (EP/M507143/1) and (EP/N001745/1).

This article presents a new econometric framework for estimation of affine Gaussian DTSMs under restrictions on risk prices, which addresses the issues of a large model space and of model uncertainty using a Bayesian approach. A simulation study demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method. Data for U.S.Treasury yields calls for tight restrictions on risk pricing: only level risk is priced, and only changes in the slope affect term premia. Incorporating the restrictions changes the model-implied short-rate expectations and term premia. Interest rate persistence is higher than in a maximally flexible model, hence expectations of future short rates are more variablerestrictions on risk prices help resolve the puzzle of implausibly stable short-rate expectations in this literature. Consistent with survey evidence and conventional macro wisdom, restricted models attribute a large share of the secular decline in long-term interest rates to expectations of future nominal short rates.

Which indicators are more suitable on short-term data decision making? The instruments of technical analyses offer answer to that key issue for the whole investment community. The technical analysis is based on the analysis of time series and the monitoring of statistical variables, such as price, its change or traded volumes, by using four basic pillars: indicators, lines, candles and shapes. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the variability of technical analyses usage by the short-term prediction of different asset classes. Methodologically, patterns of charts and diagrams drawn according to Fibonacci sequence and Elliot waves have been used. The results show an evidence of relative accuracy of technical analyses predictions by short-term periods mainly by currency pairs, stock indices and commodities. The paper also illustrates the overview of researchers in the area suggesting which method of decision making among technical analysis and fundamental analysis has higher value for investors. The paper highlights the necessity of combining fundamental and technical analysis, as investors using both techniques achieve better performance in long-term perspectives in comparison to those depending only on one of them.","[Bikar, Milos; Vavrova, Katarina] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Bikár, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",milos.bikar@gmail.com; katarina.vavrov10@gmail.com,,,VEGA [1/0007/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),The presented working paper is the output of the scientific grants VEGA n. 1/0007/16 The impact of the global economic developments and trends in the direction of the euro area economy on financial management of business entities in Slovakia.,,22,0,0,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1472,1479,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300188,0

It may be possible to improve the efficiency of vertical axis wind technology by deploying turbines in clusters. There might also be advantages to deploying vertical axis turbines at a smaller scale in urban or suburban areas and in places where the risk of bird damage is highest. Would these features increase public acceptance of new wind turbine installations and possibly open up new areas for wind energy development? We conducted a public opinion poll in California to examine public receptiveness. We used experimental design to assess the willingness to accept vertical axis turbines in certain urban settings. We find that the visual differences between the vertical and conventional wind turbines did not matter very much in any of the hypothetical settings in which we placed them. However, the prospect of killing fewer birds registered strongly with our survey respondents, though it could be outweighed by concern for cost. We also show that certain segments of the population, particularly those who are more educated, may be open to a more extensive deployment of vertical axis turbines in urban communities.","[Hui, Iris; Cain, Bruce E.] Bill Lane Ctr Amer West, 172 Y2E2,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dabiri, John O.] Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Mech Engn, 169 Y2E2,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Hui, I (通讯作者)，Bill Lane Ctr Amer West, 172 Y2E2,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",irishui@stanford.edu; bcain@stanford.edu; jodabiri@stanford.edu,,,,,,,35,34,36,1,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,258,271,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.028,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800026,0

Against this background, increased attention will be given to this group of respondents. The article draws on research conducted in 2018, which focuses on customer preferences and attitudes towards loyalty programs. The research was conducted through an e-questionnaire distributed on the web interface. The total number of respondents is 269 and the data obtained is processed using basic descriptive statistics. The presented outputs of the article can serve as a material for the targeted creation of effective loyalty programs in the South Bohemian Region under conditions of globalization.","[Jambal, Tsolmon; Lizbetinova, Lenka; Stuchly, Jaroslav] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Lizbetinová, L (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corp Strategy, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",jambal@mail.vstecb.cz; lizbetinova@mail.vstecb.cz; stuchly@mail.vstecb.cz,"Jambal, Tsolmon/AAG-7352-2021; Ližbetinová, Lenka/O-9181-2019","Jambal, Tsolmon/0000-0001-7450-690X; Ližbetinová, Lenka/0000-0001-8969-2071",[IGS 8110IGS201813],,This paper is an output of the science project IGS 8110IGS201813 Supporting the subjects taught by linking the theoretical knowledge with the practice of companies by analysing and evaluating the level of customer relationship management in a selected sample of companies.,,19,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,570,576,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300075,0

It is important to focus on the training of ship crewmembers, their theoretical basics and practical skills. At present, simulators are a complement to practical training. One way to improve the quality of training for ship crewmembers is the process of deployment new educational technologies - ship simulators. Ship simulators have a wide range of focus and varying levels of usability. As progress of IT technologies move forward, the simulator requirements are also clearly defined. The essence of the whole function is the environment in which and how simulators work within the virtual reality. In the field of maritime transport, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) deals with the qualifications, crew requirements and training standards. It creates international regulations on the safety of the environment, legal issues and the protection of human life at sea. Minimum qualification standards for the training of crewmembers are laid down in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).

The recently emerged case regarding the use of ZA fertilizers has raised many polemics in the urban community because of its nature for plants, making it a non food grade products. Therefore the alternative is needed to replace the role of ZA in nata de coco making process. The existence of nitrogen in soaked soybean water from Tempe Kweni, an industry in Bantul, has been proven through laboratory results, in which there is a 0,05% content of nitrogen, which had qualified the subtitutes of ZA. Soybean soaked water is also acidic (pH 4-5) so the addition of acetic acid in nata de coco production is unnecessary. The purpose of this study is to determine the formulation of helping materials as a replacement for ZA for making nata de coco, identify the characteristic of nata de coco without ZA from the sensory test results and determine the technical and financial feasibility of nata de coco without ZA production. In this research, trial production of nata de coco without ZA will use 5 variations of waste water concentrations, which is 20%, 25%, 30%, 40% and 50%. Results showed that after 8 days of fermentation the best concentration is obtained from 30% soaked soybean water adding, with 1,2 - 1,3 cm nata thickness.

Although negative effects on household welfare and related poverty measures are widely discussed as possible consequences, empirical evidence is missing. We try to fill this gap by simulating an input-output model coupled with household survey data to examine the welfare effects of different carbon tax rates over the income distribution. The currently effective tax rate is small and has negligible effects on household welfare. Higher simulated tax rates, maintaining the current tax base, show a slight progressivity but welfare losses remain moderate. Welfare losses, regressivity and poverty rise more with widening the tax base towards natural gas and the other greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) mainly through food price increases. For a complete analysis of the policy, we simulate a redistribution of calculated tax revenues and find that the resulting effects become highly progressive, also for high rates, wider tax bases and even in the absence of perfect targeting of social welfare programs.","[Renner, Sebastian] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Neuer Jungfenistieg 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany; [Renner, Sebastian] Univ Goettingen, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",German Institute of Global & Area Studies; University of Gottingen,"Renner, S (通讯作者)，GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Neuer Jungfenistieg 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany.",sebastian.renner@giga-hamburg.de,,,"Volkswagen Stiftung (Europe and Global Challenges, Climate Mitigation and Poverty Reduction Project)","Volkswagen Stiftung (Europe and Global Challenges, Climate Mitigation and Poverty Reduction Project)","This work was supported by Volkswagen Stiftung (Europe and Global Challenges, Climate Mitigation and Poverty Reduction Project).

The aim of the paper was to assess whether higher education of a household head is a significant determinant in increasing the probability of poverty exit. A meta-analysis was used which was conducted based on data from selected studies from all over the world. The studies had to meet some criteria related to availability and comparability of the data. Cumulative meta-analysis allowed showing a change in the importance of higher education to the probability of poverty exit. This approach allowed assessing if higher education is fixed determinant in the era of globalization. Additionally, a meta-analysis conducted in subgroups of countries (subgroups according to development status) allowed comparing the importance of higher education in countries at different levels of economic development. Based on preliminary analysis of the previous research results it was possible to formulate a hypothesis that the odds of poverty exit are definitely higher in households with the high-educated head than in households with the low-educated head. A meta-analysis allows answering the question if this relationship is a global tendency or higher education is more important in some groups of countries than in other groups.","[Saczewska-Piotrowska, Anna] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, Dept Labour Market Forecasting & Anal, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Saczewska-Piotrowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, Dept Labour Market Forecasting & Anal, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",anna.saczewska-piotrowska@ue.katowice.pl,"Sączewska-Piotrowska, Anna/S-7759-2018","Sączewska-Piotrowska, Anna/0000-0001-9760-3649",,,,,24,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2773,2780,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300355,0

Under the influence of globalization, the attractiveness of this theme is still increasing considerably. The first prediction models were developed in the United States of America in the 1930s. Initial efforts to monitor and predict the financial health of a business are therefore a response to financial collapse during the Great Depression. Since then, many models have been developed not only in the US but also in other countries in the world. The article focuses on the analysis of historical development of prediction models. We focused on comparing the methods used in models, the year and the country of origin, as well as the number and content of the variables used to predict the financial health. Finally, we calculated prediction models on the sample of enterprises. For the calculation, we chose models that differ with the year and country of origin, the number of variables and used methods.

This study aims at aiding the mostly qualitative discussion with quantitative evidence from computing quarterly partial market equilibria Q4 2011 - Q4 2015 under present short-term profit maximisation and different competition setups. Although the model performs reasonably well in explaining pre-2014 prices, all setups fail to capture low prices, which fall even beyond perfect competition outcomes. This result is robust with respect to large variations in cost parameters. Rejecting present short-term profit maximisation, as well as a qualitative discussion of Saudi Arabian politics and the shale oil revolution, lead to the conclusion that the price drop of 2014-16 was most plausibly the result of an attempt to defend market shares and to test for shale oil resilience, besides being fueled by other factors such as rising competitiveness of alternative technologies. Although shale oil might have increased competition permanently (as supported by model results), the agreement of December 2016 should not be misunderstood as an OPEC defeat.","[Ansari, Dawud] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Ansari, Dawud] Energy Access & Dev Program, Scharnhorststr 24, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Ansari, D (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Ansari, D (通讯作者)，Energy Access & Dev Program, Scharnhorststr 24, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",dansari@diw.de,,"Ansari, Dawud/0000-0001-5621-8357",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); DIW Berlin Graduate Centre,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); DIW Berlin Graduate Centre,"I thank Franziska Holz, Sauleh Siddiqui, Franz Hubert, Roman Mendelevitch, Jimi Oke, Daniel Huppmann, Christian von Hirschhausen, Lissy Langer, Claudia Kemfert, Adam Lederer, Katherine Croll-Knight, Paul Rinkens, and one anonymous reviewer for their support and helpful comments on the manuscript, as well as the participants and reviewers of the 15th IAEE European Conference (Vienna, 2017), the 5th International Symposium on Environment and Energy Finance Issues (Paris, 2017), the 12.

In a rapidly developing and changing landscape, traditional policy making approaches and policy options should be reconsidered in order to provide the optimal benefits to society. A typical example is the field of vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in Europe. Modern vehicle technologies are changing fast and policy instruments regulating their design should evolve accordingly in order to remain updated. In this context Europe has recently upgraded the emission test procedure for the type approval of light duty vehicles by adopting the new WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light duty vehicle Test Procedure). In order to accelerate its introduction a new modelling tool had to be introduced in the certification process together with new software based instruments, which had to be developed and implemented. This case could open the path to fully software-based vehicle certification in which modelling tools might be applied to reduce the current opportunities of manipulations offered by physical tests.","[Ciuffo, B.; Fontaras, G.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Energy Transport & Climate, Unit Sustainable Transport C4, Via E Fermi, I-2749 Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Ciuffo, B (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Energy Transport & Climate, Unit Sustainable Transport C4, Via E Fermi, I-2749 Ispra, Italy.",biagio.ciuffo@ec.europa.eu,,"Ciuffo, Biagio/0000-0003-3734-4264",,,,,25,18,18,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,76,81,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.057,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400008,0

While temporal flexibility (e.g. load shedding, load shifting) is already discussed intensively in literature, spatial load migration still is an under-researched type of DSF. Spatial load migration allows us to instantly migrate power consuming activities among different locations. Data centers (DCs) are power-intensive and process information goods. Since information goods are easily transferable through communication networks, power-intensive processing of information goods is not necessarily tied to a specific location. Consequently, geographically distributed DCs inherit in theory a considerable potential to globally migrate load. We analyze the economics of spatially migrating load to provide balancing power using geographically distributed DCs. We assure that neither of the participating electricity grids will be burdened by this mechanism. By using historical data to evaluate our model, we find reasonable economic incentives to migrate positive as well as negative balancing power. In addition, we find that current scenarios favor the migration of negative balancing power. Our research thus reveals realistic opportunities to virtually transfer balancing power between different market areas worldwide.","[Fridgen, Gilbert; Keller, Robert] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Wittelsbacherring 10, D-95444 Bayreuth, Germany; [Thimmel, Markus; Wederhake, Lars] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Augsburg,"Keller, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Wittelsbacherring 10, D-95444 Bayreuth, Germany.",gilbert.fridgen@fim-rc.de; robertkeller@fim-rc.de; markus.thimmel@fim-rc.de; lars.wederhake@fim-rc.de,,"Keller, Robert/0000-0001-7097-1724; Fridgen, Gilbert/0000-0001-7037-4807",,,,,83,18,21,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,400,413,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.018,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400037,0

As a result, the capacity of solar photovoltaics (PVs) has increased significantly and has reached 1902 MW. Nevertheless, the installation of PVs on rooftops in the residential sector accounts for only a minute percentage (0.003%) of the total capacity of installed PVs. In this paper, a feasibility analysis of grid-connected solar PV rooftops for households under the present feed-in tariff framework was performed. The results demonstrate that the current feed-in tariff is not sufficient to promote investment in PV rooftops in the residential sector under the current market situation. Moreover, in order to support the current framework, additional supportive measures including (1) an appropriate feed-in-tariff rate, (2) personal income tax exemptions, (3) carbon trading, and (4) low interest rate loans, were proposed, and their effects were evaluated. The low interest rate loan appears to be the best measure for promoting and stimulating investment in residential-scale PV rooftops without additional subsidy. The leverage effect of debt, with different debt portions, loan terms and interest rates, was investigated to suggest a suitable policy.","[Tantisattayakul, Thanapol] Thammasat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Pathum Thani, Klong Luang, Thailand; [Kanchanapiya, Premrudee] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Met & Mat Technol Ctr MTEC, Pathum Thani, Thailand",Thammasat University; National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Metal & Materials Technology Center (MTEC),"Tantisattayakul, T (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Pathum Thani, Klong Luang, Thailand.",tthanapol@tu.ac.th,"Tantisattayakul, Thanapol/L-5851-2013","tantisattayakul, thanapol/0000-0002-1433-7785",,,,,56,31,31,3,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,260,269,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.061,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400024,0

In the case of solar home systems, recent studies report positive socio-economic effects on households, but technology adoption remains underwhelming. In collaboration with a local solar technology provider, we conduct a randomized controlled trial in 75 large villages in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India to examine the ability of village solar demonstrations to create markets for solar home systems. We find no effect of such demonstrations on technology sales, awareness, or perceptions of solar technology. Technology adopters report high levels of satisfaction with product quality and service, suggesting that the null finding cannot be attributed to poor technology. These findings suggest that lack of awareness is not a binding constraint on the growth of solar technology markets in the study area. Based on additional surveys, we find evidence suggesting that access to credit from rural banks is an important explanation for variation in sales across villages. These results.do not prove that information and awareness are irrelevant in general, but they show that even carefully designed marketing campaigns cannot increase demand for new products in the presence of a binding credit constraint.","[Urpelainen, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies, 1619 Massachusetts Ave NW,Rome Bldg,4th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Yoon, Semee] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Johns Hopkins University; Yonsei University,"Urpelainen, J (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Sch Adv Int Studies, 1619 Massachusetts Ave NW,Rome Bldg,4th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",ju2178@columbia.edu,,"Yoon, Semee/0000-0002-1250-8800",Earth Institute at Columbia University under an Earth Clinic grant,Earth Institute at Columbia University under an Earth Clinic grant,"We thank MORSEL India for excellent data collection and Boond Engineering and Development for competent execution of the trial.

We use an approach grounded in agrarian political economy to critically analyze the literature on how biofuel policies interact with broader production, trade, and agro-ecological processes. We focus on policies involving the most prominent crops in the places where biofuel production has advanced the most (i.e. USA, Brazil, and the EU), but also extend analysis to their relations with broader transformations in production, commercial, and even governance practices around the world. We investigate the political and economic interests driving biofuel policies, and how these set the terms in which state interventions and policies are conceived and implemented. We find that these are not developed and implemented according to environmental or inclusive pro-poor development purposes, but according to state interests in energy security and its intersection with a tense alliance between corporate sectors, rendering many policy mechanisms ineffective or even outright counterproductive to effectively facilitate more socially and environmentally sustainable energy production and agricultural practices.","[Oliveira, Gustavo de L.

We build a model to understand the provision of quality and energy efficiency in products when a tradeoff exists between these two product attributes represented by a technological frontier. In our model, a monopoly firm offers a high-end and a low-end version of a product to two groups of consumers who differ in their willingness to pay for the product. We find that the relative energy efficiency of the two products depends on the energy price. We show that price discrimination distorts the choice of energy efficiency and quality of the low-end product on the frontier. In addition, it may cause the firm to offer an energy efficiency/quality combination for the low-end product that is below the frontier, to induce the high-end consumers to buy the high-end product. This suggests that the firm's desire to price discriminate in markets is one reason for the slow diffusion of energy saving technologies, a phenomenon known as the energy paradox.

The United Nations 'Sustainable Energy for All' initiative exemplifies the urgent need to address this issue. Recent advancements in photovoltaic, light emitting diode and battery technology have resulted in the rise of affordable and innovative household electricity technologies, however penetration rates remain low due to complexity surrounding 'last mile' distribution. This paper applies the diffusion of innovations theory as a framework to investigate the 'last mile' challenges encountered when launching a Pay As You Go Solar Home System in a region of Central East Africa. The results indicate that Pay As You Go offers the potential to deliver a disruptive positive impact with regard to increasing access to clean affordable energy for the poor, however, both the technology and business model are more complex than current alternatives and therefore require a much more developed go-to-market strategy. The cost of achieving widespread diffusion is therefore higher than similar products sold at retail, yet this is balanced by potential for a much faster rate of adoption. Finally, this paper demonstrates the applicability of the diffusion of innovations theory as a viable framework for analysing last mile challenges associated with Solar Home Systems.","[Barrie, Jack; Cruickshank, Heather J.] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Cambridge, England; [Barrie, Jack] Univ Strathclyde, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Cruickshank, Heather J.] Univ Cambridge, Smart Villages Initiat, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Strathclyde; University of Cambridge,"Barrie, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",,,"Barrie, Jack/0000-0002-2480-982X",,,,,40,58,59,3,60,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,425,436,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.016,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200040,0

For other kinds of goods and commodities ethical consumption have direct implications for, and the participation of, informed citizens. Due to its intangibility, energy lacks the same levels of reflection and intervention by citizens and those aspects are yet to be fully explored in practice. This paper contributes to the understanding of how energy justice might be approached. We reflect on an empirical experience of participatory energy budgeting, a process aimed at determining how to redistribute a share of energy linked to collective virtuous consumption behaviors. We analyze through a qualitative thematic analysis how participants make sense of the participatory energy budgeting process and the emerged dynamics within the local communities and how this process can strive to reconfigure the relationship among civil society, the energy sector and politics, in order to remediate injustices. We highlight how the construction-in-practice of energy justice in a local community might be closely linked to issues such as the form of energy governance that allows for the participation of citizens and the accountability of the process, policies and technological limitations.","[Capaccioli, Andrea; Poderi, Giacomo; Bettega, Mela; D'Andrea, Vincenzo] Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, Via Sommarive 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Poderi, Giacomo] Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Bergen, Norway",University of Trento; University of Bergen,"Capaccioli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, Via Sommarive 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",andrea.capaccioli@unitn.it; giacomo.poderi@unitn.it; mela.bettega@unitn.it; vincenzo.dandrea@unitn.it,"Poderi, Giacomo/ABF-9674-2021","Poderi, Giacomo/0000-0002-9563-3921; D'Andrea, Vincenzo/0000-0002-0598-5107; Capaccioli, Andrea/0000-0001-7281-2049",EU-FP7 programme through the project CIVIS [608774],EU-FP7 programme through the project CIVIS,This work has been supported by EU-FP7 programme through the project CIVIS (no. 608774).,,34,16,18,0,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,621,630,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.055,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200061,0

This study apply a stochastic TIMES model that considers the short-term uncertainty in electricity supply and value the flexibility of hydro reservoirs. It is the first time this approach is used to quantify the effects of these policy actions on cost-optimal investments and operations. To consider the uncertainty of the energy market, we analyse the policy actions under four different price developments for biomass, fossil fuels and electricity. The results demonstrate that our stochastic approach provides different model decisions compared to the traditional deterministic approach. Further, we show that the future role of the large hydro reservoirs in Norway and Sweden depends both on the adopted policy actions and on future energy prices, and that the policy actions have a significant impact on the development of the energy system. This insight is valuable when considering the development and management of the hydro reservoirs. It is also valuable for other European countries so that they can evaluate the interplay of the hydro reservoirs with other energy storage options.","[Seljom, Pernille; Tomasgard, Asgeir] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Seljom, Pernille] Inst Energy Technol IFE, Dept Energy Syst, Post Box 40, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Institute for Energy Technology (IFE),"Seljom, P (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Seljom, P (通讯作者)，Inst Energy Technol IFE, Dept Energy Syst, Post Box 40, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",pernille.seljom@ife.no; asgeir.tomasgard@iot.ntnu.no,"Tomasgard, Asgeir/AAX-2832-2020",,Research Council of Norway [207067],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The authors are grateful to the Research Council of Norway for funding this work as a part of the project The future Norwegian energy system in a North-European context (Grant number: 207067; https://www.forskningsradet.no/prosjektbanken/#!/project/207067/en).

Pursuing a transition towards a sustainable energy system has become a major policy concern for the Chinese central government. In response, and on the basis of a top-down and conformance-oriented system of policy implementation and evaluation, the Chinese central government has launched various policies and targets on energy efficiency and production that lower levels of government have to follow. However, the translation of top-down targets and the measurement of conformance-based targets have both proved to be problematic. This paper investigates Chinese state policy on energy efficiency through four empirical case studies. It identifies how policy design of target setting and evaluation is both impacting and driving the implementation of energy efficiency at the local urban scale. We demonstrate how local authorities are faced with constraining barriers that can inhibit the implementation of centrally issued targets and policies. These barriers may even undermine local performance in the pursuit of ambitious energy efficiency goals, resulting in potentially harmful consequences.","[Wu, Jing; Zuidema, Christian; Gugerell, Katharina; de Roo, Gert] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Wu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Spatial Planning & Environm, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands.",jing.wu@rug.nl; c.zuidema@rug.nl; k.gugerell@rug.nl; g.de.roo@rug.nl,,"Wu, Jing/0000-0002-4161-1129; Zuidema, Christian/0000-0001-5055-5053; Gugerell, Katharina/0000-0003-1768-8529",Chinese Scholarship Council [201308510146],Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This research was sponsored by the Chinese Scholarship Council [201308510146].

We find that when firms are symmetric and marginal costs are constant, an horizontal merger is welfare enhancing if efficiency gains are high enough for the merger to take place. The presence of a competitive (or monopolistic) outside market that also trades in the permits market makes profitable a merger that would not happen otherwise. When firms are vertically related in an input-output chain, an horizontal merger in one of the markets increases profits in the other market due to the permits price decrease. Finally we consider an oligopoly-fringe model in which firms differ in their marginal production costs. A merger between the dominant oligopolistic firms decreases the permits price and is always profitable. Such setting is relevant to assess the observed mergers between power generators in several market for permits, like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), allowing us to derive some policy recommendations.","[Creti, Anna] PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, LEDA, CGEMP, F-75016 Paris, France; [Sanin, Maria-Eugenia] Univ Evry Val DEssonne, EPEE EA 2177, Evry, France; [Sanin, Maria-Eugenia] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite Paris Saclay; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Sanin, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val DEssonne, EPEE EA 2177, Evry, France.;Sanin, ME (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France.",eugenia.sanin@univ-evry.fr,,,Chaire Energie et Prosperite; Chaire Developpement Durable EDF - X,Chaire Energie et Prosperite; Chaire Developpement Durable EDF - X,The authors acknowledge support from the Chaire Energie et Prosperite and from the Chaire Developpement Durable EDF - X.,,14,14,15,3,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,618,630,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.057,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900059,0

While the US and China cooperated in renewable energy development, since 2011 the countries have engaged in a protracted and major trade dispute in the solar photovoltaics industry. We propose that the US government's decision to impose, and then expand, tariffs on a number of Chinese solar producers can be explained though a model of coalitional politics, drawing on Actor-Centered Institutionalism and the Advocacy Coalition Framework. We show that a coalition of domestic manufacturers and congressional interests formed a protectionist coalition that utilized US trade law to their advantage. In doing so they sidelined a free trade coalition representing the majority of US solar photovoltaic firms. The institutional design of US trade law also facilitated the successful application of trade remedies. Our analysis suggests that the domestic politics of renewable energy trade make trade conflicts a likely outcome, leaving limited scope for policy to carefully manage the trade-off between protecting parts of manufacturing through tariffs and lowering the cost of renewable energy technologies to mitigate climate change.","[Hughes, Llewelyn] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Meekling, Jonas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Australian National University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Meekling, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",llewelyn@alum.mit.edu; meckling@berkeley.edu,"Hughes, Llewelyn/E-5634-2015","Hughes, Llewelyn/0000-0002-8352-2693",Winkler Family Foundation; Social Science Research Council; Japan Foundation Center,Winkler Family Foundation; Social Science Research Council; Japan Foundation Center,"The authors thank the reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions, and Lucy McKenzie for outstanding research assistance.

This paper takes an institutionalist approach in terms of modularity of the market design, and reviews the issues with the standard historical market model which led to the introduction of additional long term modules. We then study the interactions between the existing and new modules and identify ways in which the initial market modules can be improved to address inconsistencies with the new modules. We conclude by discussing the conditions under which the various changes in market architectures could converge toward a hybrid regime structured around a two step competition, with a competition for the market via the auctioning of long-term contracts to support investment,. followed by competition in the market for short term system optimisation via the energy market.","[Roques, Fabien] Univ Paris 09, CGEMP, Paris, France; [Roques, Fabien; Finon, Dominique] Paris Dauphine Univ, CEEM, Paris, France; [Finon, Dominique] Paris Dauphine Univ, CIRED, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech,"Roques, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CGEMP, Paris, France.;Roques, F (通讯作者)，Paris Dauphine Univ, CEEM, Paris, France.",fabien.roques@dauphine.fr; finon@centre-cired.fr,,,'Chaire European Electricity Markets' (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot; CDC,'Chaire European Electricity Markets' (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot; CDC(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),"The authors acknowledge the support of the 'Chaire European Electricity Markets' (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation, and the support of the following companies: RTE, EDF, EPEX Spot, and the CDC.

First, the electricity price has decreased as a consequence of the so-called merit-order effect. Another relevant effect is associated to the intermittent nature of Renewable Energy, which has increased the cost of ancillary services. A third and important aspect, less addressed in the literature, is the induced change in the strategic behavior of the conventional electricity producers. In principle, the entry of new generators in a concentrated market would make it more competitive and change the strategic behavior of the incumbents. We test this hypothesis for the Spanish wholesale market. While we find no significant change in behavior for Nuclear, Hydropower and Coal, a change is observed in Combined Cycle bidding strategies after the entry of renewable generators. Our analysis shows that the massive entry of Renewable Energy Sources made other generators' behavior more competitive in the short run, but the effect was not persistent.","[Ciarreta, Aitor; Paz Espinosa, Maria; Pizarro-Irizar, Cristina] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Econ, Dept Fdn Econ Anal 2, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Pizarro-Irizar, Cristina] Basque Ctr Climate Change, UPV EHU Sci Pk,Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa 48940, Spain",University of Basque Country; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Pizarro-Irizar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Econ, Dept Fdn Econ Anal 2, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",aitor.ciarreta@ehu.eus; mariapaz.espinosa@ehu.eus; cristina.pizarro@bc3research.org,"Espinosa, Maria Paz/AAW-3803-2020; Ciarreta, Aitor/H-7633-2015; Pizarro-Irizar, Cristina/D-4632-2016","Espinosa, Maria Paz/0000-0003-2189-4253; Ciarreta, Aitor/0000-0003-2627-4715; Pizarro-Irizar, Cristina/0000-0001-6204-5253",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-64467-R]; Basque Government (DEUI) [IT-783-13]; University of the Basque Country [PES14/63]; Basque Government [BFI-2011-301],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Basque Government (DEUI); University of the Basque Country; Basque Government(Basque Government),"We would like to thank the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2015-64467-R), the Basque Government (DEUI, IT-783-13) and the University of the Basque Country (PES14/63) for financial support.

A regression kink model (or continuous threshold model) is a threshold regression constrained to be everywhere continuous with a kink at an unknown threshold. We present methods for estimation, to test for the presence of the threshold, for inference on the regression parameters, and for inference on the regression function. A novel finding is that inference on the regression function is nonstandard since the regression function is a nondifferentiable function of the parameters. We apply recently developed methods for inference on nondifferentiable functions. The theory is illustrated by an application to the growth and debt problem introduced by Reinhart and Rogoff, using their long-span time-series for the United States.","[Hansen, Bruce E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hansen, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",behansen@wisc.edu,"Hansen, Bruce E/AAZ-5224-2020",,"National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1258858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The author acknowledges the support by the National Science Foundation.

To this end, Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Error Correction Model (ECM) have been estimated to quantify the short-run and long-run price and the income elasticity of various energy products. The results show that the price elasticity of demand for all fossil fuels is low, but the respective income elasticity is higher. Therefore, an increase in the general price level caused by the subsidy reform will lead to the erosion of real income and will have related welfare implications in India. The results also reveal that energy expenditure will obviously increase and hence energy consumption will decline depending upon the extent of the withdrawal of subsidy. Therefore, policy makers in India, while undertaking further reforms, must ensure that the subsidy reaches to those who truly deserve, so that the socioeconomic casualty of reforms can be minimized along with achieving fiscal goals.","[Acharya, Rajesh H.] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Sch Management, Mangaluru, Karnataka, India; [Sadath, Anver C.] Cent Univ Kerala, Dept Econ, Kasaragod, Kerala, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka; Central University of Kerala,"Acharya, RH (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Sch Management, Mangaluru, Karnataka, India.",rajeshacharyah@gmail.com; anver.omanoor@gmail.com,"Sadath, Anver/AAC-6507-2019; Sadath, Anver C/ABC-9240-2021; Acharya, Rajesh/Y-9369-2019","Sadath, Anver C/0000-0002-5368-6072; Acharya, Rajesh/0000-0002-9893-0788",,,,,45,44,46,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,453,462,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.036,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200043,0

This approach allows analyzing simultaneously short-term connections and long-run cointegrating relationships across a range of quantiles. It also provides insights on the short-run predictive power of oil prices in predicting energy prices while accounting for the cointegration between oil prices and each of the considered energy prices in low, medium and high quantiles. Two key findings emerge from this paper. First, all considered energy prices are shown to be cointegrated with oil price across quantiles meaning that a stationary equilibrium relationship exists between single energy price and oil price. Second, we find evidence that oil price is a significant predictor of individual petroleum products prices and natural gas in the short run.

In particular, it attempts to identify the causal mechanisms between their interdependence in the gas sphere and the gas conflict. The paper first shows that existing theories in the study of international relations have limitations in accounting for that conflict. Therefore, a theoretical framework drawing insights from Armstrong's model on dependence-political compliance and Crescenzi's exit model is proposed to explain it. Relying on this framework, this paper demonstrates that the 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas conflict took place through two critical causal mechanisms. In the contexts of the 2008 global financial crisis and Ukraine's anti-Russian policy, Russia and Ukraine both considered issues involved in the gas trade such as debts, prices, transit tariffs, and Ukraine's pipeline system to be very important. Therefore, when Russia issued demands with economic threats, Ukraine refused to comply.","[Lee, Yusin] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.",yslee71@gmail.com,"Lee, Yusin/AAR-3857-2021","Lee, Yusin/0000-0002-8144-2892",Yeungnam University research grant [216A061027],Yeungnam University research grant,This work has been supported by the 2016 Yeungnam University research grant (216A061027).

To test this hypothesis we develop a general equilibrium model with fully endogenous growth and estimate the policy cost for China. The framework includes disaggregated industrial and energy sectors, endogenous innovation, and sector-specific investments. We find that the governmental target of a 65 percent carbon intensity reduction until 2030 Causes a welfare reduction of 0.5 percent for China, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Costs of carbon policy for China under an internationally coordinated emission reduction amount to 4 percent of total welfare. We highlight that lower economic growth, faster energy technology development, and stronger induced innovation reduce welfare losses significantly. Increased urbanization raises the policy costs because urban households consume more energy and energy intensive goods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This period ends when the infrastructure is finished, which serves to increase each player's welfare in a subsequent non-cooperative game played by the two countries thereafter. We define an imputation distribution procedure (IDP) to share the investment costs during cooperation according to each player' future benefits. We prove that the IDP is time consistent if at any time within the cooperative period each country's share on the surplus to go is equal to or converges towards the country's relative gains from the existence of the infrastructure (realized in the subsequent non-cooperative period). Furthermore, we obtain the instantaneous side-payment scheme which makes the IDP feasible.

UK Government policy is that this material should be reused as MOX fuel in Light Water Reactors. This policy is re-examined in the light of recent experience of the US plutonium disposition programme, in which the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility is now considered to be potentially unaffordable. Problematic aspects of US programme, relevant to the UK scenario, are reviewed, to understand the possible impact on UK policy. Based on the US experience and inherent uncertainty regarding the capital and operational costs of MOX fuel fabrication and plutonium immobilisation facilities, and the associated technical risks, it is concluded that the UK policy should explicitly adopt a dual track strategy to plutonium management, with commitment that: any remaining plutonium which is not converted into MOX fuel, or otherwise reused, will be immobilised and treated as waste for disposal. This will also ensure that the UK is positioned and prepared to take forward an immobilisation and disposal programme for the plutonium stockpile, should reuse as MOX fuel not prove an economic or viable option.

In addition, some numerical results are shown to study the impact of the mean service times and of the customer-based correlation in the arrival process on the performance of the queueing system.","[Baetens, Jens; Steyaert, Bart; Claeys, Dieter; Bruneel, Herwig] Univ Ghent, Dept Telecommun & Informat Proc, SMACS Res Grp, St Pietersnieuwstr 41, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Claeys, Dieter] Univ Ghent, Dept Ind Syst Engn & Prod Design, Lean Enterprise Res Ctr, Technol Pk 903, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Claeys, Dieter] Flanders Make, Dept Agile & Human Ctr Prod & Robot Syst, Lommel, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Baetens, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Telecommun & Informat Proc, SMACS Res Grp, St Pietersnieuwstr 41, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",jens.baetens@ugent.be; bart.steyaert@ugent.be; dieter.claeys@ugent.be; herwig.bruneel@ugent.be,,,Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programma,Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programma,"Dieter Claeys is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen), Belgium.

Student support takes different forms and aims to meet different needs from country to country. In Slovakia, part of the support is indirect - going to parents of students in the form of family allowances and tax benefits. However, direct financial support take the form of scholarships/grants and loans. Merit-based motivation scholarships are granted for excellent results in studies, research and development, artistic or sporting activity. Publicly subsidised loans provided by the Education Support Fund are available for full and part-time students throughout the regular duration of study programmes. Loans range from EUR 500 per year to 2 300 per year and are taken by about 1 % of students. The miserable rate of approved applications are the weakest part of the state financial aid scheme. The data for this study are drawn from two primary sources, Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport and the Education Support Fund. The aim of this paper is to analyse impacts of globalization on the state financial aid scheme for higher education students.

International transport share of total transport volume is about 80% and it is obvious that the transport volume in the rail transport depends on the behavior of world markets. This fact influences international transport flows of goods and performance of the rail transport. Railway sidings also have a significant share of rail transport performance. Transport performance in rail freight transport has decreasing trend over the last 20 years. Decreasing of transport volume in railway transport is influenced by several factors. The most important factors are strong competition from road transport, higher costs and prices in the rail transport, non-flexibility of the rail transport and others. These factors lead to the loss of railway sidings position on the transport market. Many railway sidings have a valid operating licence however; their transport performance is very poor or none. On the other side there are railway sidings with expired operating licence which abolition is protracted, financially and legally demanding. Nevertheless, the railway siding is very important part of international rail freight transport operation. The paper focuses on the examining of the railway siding performance share in overall rail transport performance and it contains dependence analysis of railway siding performance to selected criteria: total transport volume in international transport, transport price and number of railway siding service.

Claims and counterclaims about the likely impact of new transport infrastructure on a region's economic performance have existed for centuries going back to the early days of canals and railways. High-speed rail (HSR) as a new type of infrastructure has just over 50 years of existence. The persistent debate is questioning the power of HSR in reducing economic disparities between cities and effecting economic transformation. The paper goes beyond macro-modelling, looking to more disaggregated approaches of the structural changes.

Based on point estimates, state UI eligibility expansions increased the probability of physical activity participation by 8-10 percentage points among the unemployed with less than a high school education, while a 10% increase in the maximum allowable state UI benefit increased the probability of physical activity by 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points among the unemployed who have completed high school or some college.","[Cylus, Jonathan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Cylus, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",,,"Cylus, Jonathan/0000-0001-8269-1578",European Research Council [263684]; European Research Council (ERC) [263684] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This work was supported in part by the European Research Council (Grant 263684).

This study is designed to propose some low-carbon energy strategies and quantitatively to assess CO2 emissions and reductions. The Extended Snapshot (ExSS) tool is used to quantify socioeconomic assumptions and to estimate CO2 emissions and reduction potentials. The results show that CO2 emissions are projected to increase to about 23,277 (by about 5.5 times) and 91,325 ktCO(2)/year (by about 21.6 times) in 2030BaU and 2050BaU, respectively, from 4,221 ktCO(2)/year in 2010. This study proposes five strategies for low-carbon development plan towards 2050 which are expected to reduce CO2 emissions by about 12,826 (about 55%) and 52,153 ktCO(2)/year (about 57%) in 2030CM and 2050CM, respectively. The present results should help researchers and experts gain a better understanding of CO2 emissions and reduction potentials by applying a number of low-carbon measures in Cambodia. While the results should be counted as a preliminary study because of limited available country information, they are expected to provide useful insights for the government in formulating a concrete climate change mitigation policy for the country.","[Hak, Mao] MoE, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Hak, Mao] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Matsuoka, Yuzuru] Dept Environm Engn, Kyoto, Japan; [Gomi, Kei] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hak, Mao; Matsuoka, Yuzuru; Gomi, Kei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Cluster C, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan",Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Kyoto University,"Hak, M (通讯作者)，MoE, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.;Hak, M (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Cluster C,Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.",maohakccd.se@gmail.com; matsuoka@env.kyoto-u.ac.jp; gomi.kei@nies.go.jp,,,"Environmental Research and Technology Development - Ministry of Environment, Japan [2-1402]","Environmental Research and Technology Development - Ministry of Environment, Japan","The preliminary version of the paper was presented at the Capacity-Building Workshop on Low Carbon Development Policies for Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar on 25-26 February 2014, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Numerous studies have shown that entrepreneurship plays an important role in contemporary global societies. As globalization proceeds apace, entrepreneurs and small businesses will play a more prominent role on the global business arena. Entrepreneurs have to think globally to survive locally also. Entrepreneurship today means staying abreast of worldwide trends. This paper aims to recognise the factors that motivate potential entrepreneurs in the commencement of one's own business activity and in starting up their own businesses in global market. The study was conducted by surveying 1078 people. We analysed potential entrepreneurs -students of non-economic study fields at technical universities in Slovakia. The author's questionnaire was administered to all participants. The influence of age and the degree of study on the motives of respondents was not proven. Respondents more often declared being influenced by internal motives when planning to set up their own business. The findings show that globalization has impacted towards the increasing demands of entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial skills and thinking among graduates. Entrepreneurship education can raise awareness and open the students' minds towards entrepreneurship as a career choice. Entrepreneurship can encourage people in the economic, social, cultural change, integration of society and increase social mobility. Thus, the educational programs need to be well planned in order to develop many successful and competitive global market entrepreneurs.","[Hrehova, Daniela] Tech Univ, Vysokoskolska 4, Kosice 04002, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Hrehová, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ, Vysokoskolska 4, Kosice 04002, Slovakia.",daniela.hrehova@tuke.sk,"Hrehová, Daniela/ABA-9146-2021",,MSVVAS [SR 031TUKE-4/2016],MSVVAS,This paper is an output of the science project of MSVVAS SR 031TUKE-4/2016 Education of students of technical specialization for the needs of the global labor market.,,24,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,725,732,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201028,0

These human resources represent a flexible component in terms of performance and benefits for the enterprise. In a global business environment, new management tools are introduced in the business management, one of which is controlling. It is important to know the anticipated reactions, the stuff in different positions that are already in the process of implementing a tool to eliminate negative attitudes. The aim of the paper is to present the identified socio-economic factors in the promotion and use of controlling in the practice of micro and small enterprises in Slovakia. The empirical survey was focused on the detection and analysis of financial and nonfinancial assets of controlling, and psychological aspects of the controlling perception in its implementation and use in the enterprise, on the part of business owners, managers and employees. Based on the results of the analysis, the benefits and barriers of this managerial tool in the enterprise were identified, with an emphasis on socio-economic factors. In the conclusion, a model for the implementation of controlling into enterprise practice of micro and macro enterprises is proposed to reduce and eliminate barriers and enhance benefits for the individual interest groups. The model highlights the critical points and areas in the implementation of the controlling, based on what could be its implementation in practice more simple and effective.","[Klementova, Jarmila] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia",Technical University Zvolen,"Klementová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, TG Masaryka 24, Zvolen 96053, Slovakia.",jarmila.klementova@tuzvo.sk,"Klementová, Jarmila/CAG-9381-2022","Klementová, Jarmila/0000-0002-3024-5899",,,,,19,1,1,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,945,952,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201056,0

On the other hand, in the conditions of hypercompetition, there is a tendency toward consolidation of firms and concentration of capital since large corporations have much greater financial resources, more opportunities to diversify their activities and, as a result, they occupy a relatively more stable position in the market. The banking sector that constitutes the circulatory system of any economy is not an exception. In developed countries, there is a quite high degree of concentration of banking markets, reflected in the corresponding values of concentration ratio and Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The Russian banking sector has certain characteristics concerning the dominance of banks that are under the state control, so special attention should be paid to the distribution of market power between the largest banks. Therefore, the authors analyzed the degree of concentration on the Russian banking market with the help of not only concentration ratio and Herfindahl-Hirschman index, but also the Linda index, which concentrates researchers' attention on this aspect. There is a clear dominance of one bank in the Russian banking sphere, but overall the concentration of the market is moderate (with the exception of the highly concentrated segment for attracting deposits from the individuals). At the same time, there is an upward trend in the concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and accordingly it can be concluded that the degree of concentration in the Russian banking market now exceeds the European level.","[Kotcofana, Tatiana; Pashkus, Vadim] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Univ Skaya Emb 7-9, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Stazhkova, Polina] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Educ Programs, Univ Skaya Emb 7-9, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Pashkus, V (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Univ Skaya Emb 7-9, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",tankotsofan@mail.ru; stazhkova@mail.ru; pashkus@mail.ru,"Pashkus, Vadim Y/N-1291-2015; Kotcofana, Tatyana/I-6264-2016","Kotcofana, Tatyana/0000-0003-0219-7508",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1086,1094,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202007,0

It lacks, in particular, strategies on how to reduce the use of fossil fuels. In this context the distinctive prospect of carbon capture and storage (CCS) - reducing emissions, albeit using fossil fuels on a large scale is of particular interest. CCS technologies promise to solve the climate problem independent of drawn-out political disputes and without changing production and consumption patterns. Conflicts about CCS put the fundamental debate on the agenda, whether a comprehensive transformation of social structures is (un-)necessary and (un-)desired in order to solve the ecological crisis. Therefore, in this paper CCS-conflicts are analyzed with a broader perspective including their effects on general struggles about international climate governance. The key research question is to what extent established social practices and structures become politicized - i.e. challenged. Based on the presented empirical findings, I discuss two theses: First, that the future of climate governance is contingent on decisions about the continued use of fossil fuels. Second, that CCS-conflicts have an explosive force that could lead to massive cracks within the paradigm of ecological modernization and thus could politicize international climate policy.","[Krueger, Timmo] Univ Hamburg, Dept Earth Sci, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Krüger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Abt Humangeog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",timmo.krueger@uni-hamburg.de,,"Kruger, Timmo/0009-0007-6208-3744",,,,,41,30,31,1,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,58,67,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.059,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900007,0

We can also uncover a significant amount of problems with international delivery, such as poor communication, unacceptable delays, high shipping costs and unexpected charges, also cross-border returning unwanted or faulty items. Here the authors think it is necessary to improve the world-wide interoperability of international delivery operations (e.g. the data elements related shipments, label production for global tracking and identification).

In fact, the tax systems of countries are compelled to compete for the taxpayer. It requires effective management tools, in particular, the activities of tax authorities. The paper suggests an approach to manage activities of tax authorities, based on the application of a system of strategies, where the strategy is understood as the mechanism for creating an activity plan (proposed by Yu.B. Melnikov). One of the tools for describing this strategy is an algebraic approach. Yu.B. Melnikov understands it as a system of three components: a set of basic strategies; typical combinations of strategies; an approximation mechanism. It is shown that when performing some natural assumptions, the strategy of the tax authority activity is a particular case of the strategy of routine modeling. Previously, an algebraic representation of the strategy of routine modeling as a combination of two strategies was obtained. The first of these is called the strategy of algebraic creation of the plan, and the second is called the strategy of components change of the plan. The latter, in turn, can be represented in the form of a combination of three strategies: the strategy of searching for and using the analogy, the strategy of enrichment, reduction, abstraction, concretization of the plan, the strategy of construction the plan by iterative approximation. Examples of the use of strategies for managing the activities of tax authorities in the context of globalization are given.","[Melnikov, Yury B.] A Valek Str 12-32, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia; [Onokhina, Elena A.] Traktoristov Str 17-27, Ekaterinburg 620130, Russia; [Shitikov, Sergey A.] Radischev Str 31-201, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia",,"Melnikov, YB (通讯作者)，A Valek Str 12-32, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia.",UriiMelnikov58@gmail.com; Onohina@yandex.ru; Shitikov-s-a@yandex.ru,,,RFBR [16-06-00240],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The reported study funds by RFBR according to the research project No. 16-06-00240.,,15,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1557,1565,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202064,0

A dysfunction disrupts the smooth functioning of organizations, hinders or even prevents proper management of a selected organizational system. Sources and areas of organizational dysfunctions are varied, but some regularities can be observed. It is vital to come to know them in the context of globalization, which forces companies and their managers worldwide to deal with similar problems. This paper aims to present selected dysfunctions in organizations and management, with particular emphasis on the sources and mechanisms of their formation. The paper was written on the basis of qualitative partially-structured interview surveys. The intended outcome of the surveys was the development of an open catalogue of such dysfunctions. The choice of the research method was a consequence of the purpose and object of the study. Gaining knowledge of organizational dysfunctions requires the closest, sometimes even informal, contact with respondents. The surveys were conducted among 35 purposefully selected entrepreneurs, managers, and specialists of various levels. The interviews, ranging from 30 minutes to 6 hours in duration, were recorded and transcribed. The respondents were asked about and requested to indicate dysfunctional phenomena in their organizations, at the interface between the organization and its environment, or in the immediate surroundings. The surveys allowed for identifying certain organizational dysfunctions, finding their sources, and determining areas of occurrence. The most crucial identified sources of dysfunctions include: autonomization, conflict between long-and short-term perspectives, extreme economization, organizational mismatch, lack of systems thinking, fragmentation, and lack of binding actions.","[Pasieczny, Jacek] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Pasieczny, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",pasiecznyjacek@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1874,1881,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203038,0

This region had, and continues to have, legislative, administrative and financial prerogatives in areas of public intervention that are the duty of the central government in the 15 Italian ordinary regions. Accordingly, Friuli-Venezia Giulia could have year by year exploited such prerogatives to achieve an economic development higher than that attainable in the absence of its autonomy. In other words, Friuli-Venezia Giulia long-run economic growth would have been less than that actually experienced if the region had been an ordinary one. To test this hypothesis, the synthetic control method has been adopted. A suitable synthetic Friuli-Venezia Giulia has been constructed to contrast the evolution of regional real per capita GDP, observed over the post-autonomy-policy period, with the corresponding evolution of the same aggregate for the synthetic counterpart. This comparison reveals that if Friuli-Venezia Giulia were not an autonomous region, its per capita GDP would be significantly lower than that effectively observed.","[Podesta, Federico] Bruno Kessler Fdn, Res Inst Evaluat Publ Policies, Via S Croce 77, I-38122 Trento, Italy",Fondazione Bruno Kessler; FBK-IRVAPP - Research Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies,"Podestà, F (通讯作者)，Bruno Kessler Fdn, Res Inst Evaluat Publ Policies, Via S Croce 77, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",podesta@irvapp.it,,"Podesta, Federico/0000-0003-0307-8041",,,,,27,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The aim of our research is to analyse the relationship between fertility dynamics and provision of housing in Russia in order to subsequently assess the effectiveness of the most expensive measure for stimulating fertility in the state's history the so-called maternity capital. We estimated regression models for the time series of fertility rates and the availability of housing. To assess the strength of relationship between the time series, we analysed correlation between regressions' residuals in two models. A retrospective analysis of the time series showed no correlation between the two in a historical context. Throughout the time that the maternity capital was in place the correlation analysis also revealed no relationship between them. Our analysis showed that these variables were not significantly correlated either in urban or rural Russian areas. We can conclude that the introduction of maternity capital in Russia was not underpinned by profound statistical and demographic analysis.

There is likely to be a growing mismatch between skills needed and talent available, very important is an increased need for demographic and cultural sensitivity, more work will be done by diverse work teams often at a distance from one another.

As a result, recent policy and research attention has focused on the potential for temporal flexibility of demand, especially in the context of intermittent low-carbon generation. Much of this work emphasises the need to understand what makes up the peak and to engineer solutions to meet this 'normal' consumption. However, today's patterns of temporal consumption may only be a snapshot of continuing change. This paper uses UK household time-use survey data to analyse change in temporal patterns of activities over the last 40 years to shed light on apparent temporal shifts in overall UK electricity demand. The results highlight long term evolution in when and where people work, travel, eat, use media and carry out social activities. In particular they suggest that changing patterns of labour market participation may be contributing to shifts in food related, personal/home care and media activities which correlates with shifts in electricity demand. We conclude that both stable and dynamic social structures and forms of organisation have direct implications for policy debates around current and future flexible demand-side solutions.","[Anderson, Ben] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Energy & Climate Change Div, Southampton, Hants, England; [Torriti, Jacopo] Univ Reading, Sch Construct Management & Engn, Reading, Berks, England",University of Southampton; University of Reading,"Anderson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Environm, Energy & Climate Change Div, Southampton, Hants, England.",b.anderson@soton.ac.uk; j.torriti@reading.ac.uk,"Anderson, Benjamin/J-7292-2019","Anderson, Ben/0000-0003-2092-4406; Torriti, Jacopo/0000-0003-0569-039X","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011723/1, EP/P000630/1]; RCUK Energy Programme; EPSRC [EP/P000630/1, EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); RCUK Energy Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant numbers EP/K011723/1 and EP/P000630/1] as part of the RCUK Energy Programme.

Both standard and spatial forms are estimated for seven different sets of countries to assess the robustness of the results. Finally, several forecasts are performed to verify global sustainability and to provide some policy suggestions for the period 2015-2100. The empirical results indicate that (i) most areas support the standard EKC, (ii) there seems to be an inverted U-shaped relationship between neighbouring per capita income and national per capita emissions in Europe, Asia and the World as a whole, (iii) neighbouring energy intensity increases national per capita emissions, and (iv) forecasts show that economic growth will accelerate climate change. However, a steady annual growth in renewable energy consumption and a steady decrease in energy intensity, both close to 2,5%, may guarantee environmental sustainability prior to 2100.","[Balado-Naves, Roberto; Francisco Banos-Pino, Jose; Mayor, Matias] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; [Balado-Naves, Roberto] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Avda Cristo,S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Balado-Naves, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.;Balado-Naves, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Avda Cristo,S-N, E-33071 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",UO217340@uniovi.es; jbanos@uniovi.es; mmayorf@uniovi.es,"Balado-Naves, Roberto/JFS-0360-2023; Mayor, Matías/A-1216-2010; Baños, José/H-8565-2015","Mayor, Matías/0000-0001-6466-8884; Banos Pino, Jose Francisco/0000-0002-3685-7909; Balado-Naves, Roberto/0000-0002-7771-4998","Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (Spain) [ECO2017-86402-C2-1-R, ECO2016-75805-R]",Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (Spain),The authors acknowledge the financial support of Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (Spain) ECO2017-86402-C2-1-R & ECO2016-75805-R.,,82,116,120,6,81,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,266,279,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.059,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700027,0

Spanish RES cooperatives, unlike other European countries, are few in number. Here, we review their development by applying the Multi-Level Perspective approach. Spanish RES cooperatives have recently come up against a hostile regulatory and economic context, which has induced specific organizational and operating structures such as the application of innovative participation methods and investment tools. Spanish RES cooperatives regularly collaborate in sharing learning processes and experiences, having also demonstrated their capacity to spread new ideas at both social and political levels. However, despite their growth and territorial spread over the last few years, RES cooperatives still have a minor presence in the Spanish energy system. Although some internal factors may limit their potential as an active instrument towards the transition to RES in the country, the regime's resistance is found to be the main barrier. This paper concludes with some recommendations for policy makers and RES cooperatives to enhance its potential role in the forthcoming energy transition process.","[Capellan-Perez, Inigo] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Campos-Celador, Alvaro; Teres-Zubiaga, Jon] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Thermal Engn, Leioa, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; University of Basque Country,"Capellán-Pérez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingn Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.;Campos-Celador, A; Terés-Zubiaga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Thermal Engn, Leioa, Spain.",inigo.capellan@uva.es; alvaro.campos@ehu.eus; jon.teres@ehu.eus,"Capellán-Pérez, Iñigo/H-6069-2015; Campos-Celador, Álvaro/H-2582-2015; Terés-Zubiaga, Jon/G-9896-2015","Capellán-Pérez, Iñigo/0000-0002-3098-8027; Terés-Zubiaga, Jon/0000-0002-6409-1824; CAMPOS-CELADOR, ALVARO/0000-0002-5628-8192",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [691287]; Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [FJCI-2016-28833]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [691287] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020); Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This work has been partially developed under the MEDEAS project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 691287.

It examines the utility's industrial rebate programs for lighting, motor, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and estimates the economic and environmental impacts of the programs using an input-output modeling framework. All three rebate programs provided a modest economic boost not only to directly involved equipment manufacturers and marketing service providers, but also to other upstream industries responding to the direct impact and the final demand augmented by the associated increase in value added in the regional economy. Emissions avoided as a result of electricity savings were found to outweigh additional emissions generated from the production of the energy-efficiency equipment in the region throughout the program years. However, if the full equipment purchase data were made available, the amount of added CO2 emissions would be larger.","[Choi, Jun-Ki] Univ Dayton, Dept Mech Engn, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45409 USA; [Eom, Jiyong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea; [McClory, Emma] Int Paper, Selma, AL USA",University System of Ohio; University of Dayton; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Choi, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Dayton, Dept Mech Engn, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45409 USA.",jchoi1@udayton.edu; eomjiyong@business.kaist.ac.kr; emma.mcclory@ipaper.com,"Choi, Jun-Ki/I-2576-2012; liang, de kun/GXF-2889-2022; Eom, Jiyong/A-1161-2014","Choi, Jun-Ki/0000-0001-5954-1889; Eom, Jiyong/0000-0002-8092-5921",Hanley Sustainability Institute [HSI-92024]; Ministry of Environment of Korea through its Climate Change Correspondence Program [2004001300002]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2012-S1A3A-2033860],"Hanley Sustainability Institute; Ministry of Environment of Korea through its Climate Change Correspondence Program(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government)",The authors appreciate the support they have received from the Hanley Sustainability Institute (HSI-92024).

This paper improves upon these approaches by developing a real options-based stochastic dynamic programming method for valuing and planning low-carbon energy RD&D investment and is the first of its kind to disaggregate the effects of R&D and learning-by-doing. This simplified model captures the relevant features of the problem and provides general insights on RD&D strategy under technological uncertainty. Results indicate that imminent deployment, high cost, lower exogenous cost reductions, and lower program funds all promote R&D spending over learning-by doing, since under these circumstances a breakthrough, rather than slow and consistent cost reductions, will render the program successful.","[Fertig, Emily] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Fertig, E (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",mail@emilyfertig.com,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program; Alfred P.

Energy-mix is important mainly because maintaining energy supplies exclusively using renewable energy sources is not completely feasible. Our study takes a contingent approach to energy mix policies and suggests that the appropriate mix for reducing carbon emissions is not static but dynamic depending on the developmental stages of national economic systems. We follow the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, the most influential model for relating CO2 emissions to economic development, but depart from it by utilizing multifactor productivity data, rather than the conventional measure of GDP per capita, to capture economic growth. Empirical analyses of OECD countries from 1985 to 2013 show that the best energy policies for OECD countries is the gradual decrease in their relative reliance on natural gas, nuclear power, bio and waste fuels in a short run, over the next about 9, 2 and 5 years respectively, whereas solar and wind power can decrease CO2 in a long run as the economy continues to grow.","[Kim, Jiwon] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Gwankak Ro 1, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Sangchan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Gwankak Ro 1, Seoul, South Korea.",jiwon0715@snu.ac.kr,"; Park, Sangchan/B-3269-2015","Kim, Jiwon/0000-0003-0251-0621; Park, Sangchan/0000-0001-5026-1047",Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning through the Graduate School of Green Growth at KAIST College of Business in 2017,Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning through the Graduate School of Green Growth at KAIST College of Business in 2017,"The authors thank Senior Editor Stephen Brown and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback throughout the review process.

South Korea has promoted the use of such electricity through various programmes, such as Feed-in Tariff from 2002 to 2011, and Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) since 2012. The RPS appears to have been particularly effective in stimulating the use of RES-E. However, there remain several issues regarding the current RPS' policy design. This study examines South Korea's RPS by focusing on two issues. The first issue is the regulation of technology competition under the RPS; and the second issue is risk mitigation, which is generally known as a weakness of the RPS policy. This study suggests that one option for addressing both these issues is a policy mix of RPS and long-term contract auctions with a sliding premium. In particular, a technology-specific auction can be a complement to the technology-neutral RPS, not only in terms of minimising risk, but also in terms of cost and dynamic efficiencies. The synergy effect between these two policies is expected to be more significant than alternative policy combinations.","[Kwon, Tae-hyeong] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Publ Adm, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Kwon, TH (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Publ Adm, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea.",tkwon@hufs.ac.kr,,"Kwon, Tae-Hyeong/0000-0001-9706-5190",Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This study was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund of 2018.,,29,34,34,4,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,443,449,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.016,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700044,0

This paper examines the impact of subsidies from the California Solar Initiative (CSI) on non-residential adoption of solar panels. We find evidence that firms do respond to higher solar subsides by increasing their intensity of solar energy. A 10% increase in the subsidy amount leads to an increase in solar capacity by between 1.36% and 2.55%. In addition, although peer effects seem to play an important role in solar adoption decisions, we do not find evidence of peer effects in the intensity of adoption. Both of these findings add a unique perspective to the growing literature on solar energy. This study is also of interest to policy makers who must understand the benefits and costs associated with higher subsidies for inducing technology adoption.","[Frey, Elaine F.; Mojtahedi, Saba] Calif State Univ Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Mojtahedi, Saba] Hyundai MOBIS Parts Amer, 10550 Talbert Ave, Fountain Valley, CA 92780 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Frey, EF (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",elaine.frey@csulb.edu; sabamojtahedi@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,14,15,1,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,27,35,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.020,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700004,0

The private car mode accounts for the largest share of the total monetary, energy and environmental resource investment of the terrestrial transportation, which means the lowest input-output and environmental efficiency. Consequently, improvement of energy and environmental efficiency in individual transport modes and the inevitable need to encourage the population to shift to public transport modes whit better performances remain crucial priorities. The most efficient transport modality depends on the evaluation method applied that assigns different priorities to specific aspects. From a monetary perspective, the most efficient passenger transport modality is the regular train followed by the high-speed train. In terms of cumulative energy demand, regular train and subway have the lowest unit cost among all passenger transport modes. Concerning the emergy accounting considering the environmental support, the urban bus for passengers and the regular train for commodity transport show the best performance per unit service. Even with needs for improved technical efficiency, the promotion of above less resource-intensive modalities in accordance with the different purposes would improve the global efficiency of the transportation system and offer better and larger transport options with the same resource investment.","[Huang, Shupei; An, Haizhong; Fang, Wei] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shupei; Viglia, Silvio; Fiorentino, Gabriella; Corcelli, Fabiana; Ulgiati, Sergio] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, Ctr Direz Isola C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy; [Huang, Shupei; An, Haizhong; Fang, Wei] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Carrying Capac Assessment Resource & Envi, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ulgiati, Sergio] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shupei; An, Haizhong; Fang, Wei] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Strateg Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing; Parthenope University Naples; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Beijing Normal University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Huang, SP (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hspburn@163.com,"fiorentino, gabriella/F-5499-2019; Ulgiati, Sergio/ABE-9420-2020; Fang, Wei/JPX-9298-2023","Fiorentino, Gabriella/0000-0002-2654-4925; Corcelli, Fabiana/0000-0002-7394-450X; Viglia, Silvio/0000-0002-4994-119X; An, Haizhong/0000-0002-6141-5619; Ulgiati, Sergio/0000-0001-6159-4947","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017042]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71771022, 41430861]; Key Laboratory of Carrying Capacity Assessment for Resource and Environment, Ministry of Land and Resources [CCA2017.19]; EU Project EUFORIE - European Futures for Energy Efficiency - EU [EE-12-2014]; School of Environment, Beijing Normal University [B17005]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Carrying Capacity Assessment for Resource and Environment, Ministry of Land and Resources; EU Project EUFORIE - European Futures for Energy Efficiency - EU(European Union (EU)); School of Environment, Beijing Normal University","Shupei Huang acknowledges the support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no: 2652017042), Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 71771022 and 41430861) and the fund from Key Laboratory of Carrying Capacity Assessment for Resource and Environment, Ministry of Land and Resources (Grant no: CCA2017.19).

From the perspective of source control, this study investigates the impact of industrial structure adjustment on China's energy saving and pollution reduction goals by developing a new energy-environmental-economy model, integrating a dynamic input-output model and multi-objective model. The three best solutions are screened from the Pareto-optimal front conforming to decision-makers' preferences. The results show that for China to successively achieve its set goals, it needs to modify and optimize the country's industrial structure. By optimizing its industrial structure, China's energy intensity of the three preferred solutions can be reduced by 17.7%, 17.0%, and 17.5% compared with 2015 levels, which helps to attain the target energy-saving goal. Emissions of COD, SO2, and NOx are significantly reduced; however, the reduction goal of NH3-N is barely realized. In the restructuring process, GDP can be maintained at 6.6-6.8% from 2013 to 2020. These findings could alleviate local governments' concerns that implementation of stringent energy-saving and pollution-reduction mechanisms would harm their local economies.","[Yu, Shiwei; Zheng, Shuhong; Zhang, Xuejiao; Gong, Chengzhu; Cheng, Jinhua] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shiwei; Gong, Chengzhu; Cheng, Jinhua] China Univ Geosci, Ctr Resources & Environm Econ Res, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Wuhan; China University of Geosciences - Wuhan,"Yu, SW; Cheng, JH (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",ysw81993@sina.com; chengjinhua100@126.com,"Yu, Shiwei/ABD-4060-2021","Gong, Chengzhu/0000-0002-8124-5581",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573236]; National Social Sciences Fund of China [18VSJ037],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Sciences Fund of China,Financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71573236) and the National Social Sciences Fund of China (Grant no. 18VSJ037) are gratefully acknowledged.,,51,77,82,13,165,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,300,312,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.034,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700028,0

We review construction and operation experience with new orders since Chernobyl. We then examine the status of the large number of orders Rosatom has won, the estimates of construction cost and how they compare with those of its competitors. We then examine whether Russia and Rosatom will have the financial and supply chain capability to fulfil more than a small proportion of its order book.

Responding to this question by the actor framework is not enough to understand the politics of creating energy notions to facilitate policy transition. This study investigates the relationship between the creation of energy policy network and the framing of an energy agenda setting from 1987 to 2014 under the guidance of these two questions: who controlled the state energy agenda setting networks? How do they create an energy agenda to enable policy transition? This paper relies on content analysis by focusing on energy regulations and government reports to present the network construction and agenda setting. The results show that the Prime Minister office's network and the Ministry of Energy network are the two key energy agenda setting networks. Sharing power between the government and the private sector, empowering the bureaucratic network for controlling the energy industry, and controlling the privatized energy companies and centralizing energy planning by the government are the three important sets of agenda. These conclusions provide an analytic model of energy politics for energy scarce countries.","[Aunphattanasilp, Chumphol] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci Global Soc, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University,"Aunphattanasilp, C (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci Global Soc, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",c.aunphattanasilp.127@s.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,26,8,8,3,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,593,599,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.006,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300055,0

The aim of the study is to test the empirical evidence of regional and firm-specific effects on innovations. For the empirical analysis variables of three dimensions are considered: availability and quality of local inputs, knowledge spillover, efficiency of regional innovation system and intra-firm capacity. The effects of these variables are estimated using three-level random effect logit models which account for the clustered and longitudinal structure of the data. In the focus is the empirical analysis of the expected impacts of regional and firm-specific factors on various categories of innovation activities in Germany. The differences between the various kinds of innovations became important when considering the regional and firm-specific variables in detail. While for radical innovations the unemployment rate, the share of MINT graduates, the R&D expenditures and industry's regional concentration have significant, but relatively small impacts, for other types of innovation the regional variables are insignificant. Overall the empirical results show that the regional intra-class correlation is small and the firm-specific variables are crucial for modelling innovation activities in Germany and dominate the regional dimension.","[Bellmann, Lutz] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Bellmann, Lutz; Evers, Katalin] Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Hujer, Reinhard] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.;Bellmann, L (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Lutz.Bellmann@iab.de; Katalin.Evers@iab.de; Reiner.Hujer@gmx.de,,,,,,,70,5,5,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In fact, since CO2 emission (energy consumption) is directly correlated to economic prosperity and industrialization (see Table 1 and Figure 1), Ethiopia should plan to increase her CO2 emission per capita as much as possible. Ethiopia should understand that climate agreements such as the Paris accord are designed and destined to fail. Hence, Ethiopia should avoid carbon-tax, different form of financial aid, poverty-trap; instead she should plan on how to live with the inevitable global atmospheric CO2 concentration increase. The same is true for majority of least developed countries (LDCs). Global climate change issue could be a neo-colonialism and neo-cold-war instruments designed by neo-liberal institutions; hence, if Ethiopia is willing to confront any political and economic burden from Earth friendly nations and institutions, Ethiopia should lead other Africans' towards the mid-way solution; and if Earth friendly countries does not agree with such just and simple solution; then, Ethiopia should lead Africa, in following USA, and exit from the Pans climate accord.

When heterogeneity in the pricing dynamics is captured by MG and MG-CCE estimators, persistence of retail price responses becomes considerably lower than the typical OLS estimations from average group data would suggest.","[Balaguer, Jacint; Ripolles, Jordi] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Ripollés, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.",jacint.balaguer@eco.uji.es; jripolle@eco.uji.es,"Ripollés, Jordi/AGL-5986-2022; Ripolles, Jordi/R-6942-2018; Balaguer, Jacint/L-5291-2014","Ripolles, Jordi/0000-0002-8637-6871; Balaguer, Jacint/0000-0003-3798-1976",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-58975-P]; Universitat Jaume I [UJI-B2017-17],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2014-58975-P) and Universitat Jaume I (UJI-B2017-17) are gratefully acknowledged.,,29,0,0,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,495,501,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.013,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200045,0

Private response to this threat often proves to be inadequate. For example, empirical evidence reveals a sub-optimal investment by firms in energy efficiency projects capable of reducing energy costs and CO2 emissions, as well as adaptation projects able to reduce the vulnerability of the ecosystem. On the other hand, past public programs that provided financial subsidies to the above-mentioned projects have proven to be not particularly cost-effective or able to enhance final performances. In this paper, as an alternative to public subsidies, we propose and assess the opportunity to implement Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) where the public regulator plays a more active role in the investment choice. Precisely, we model the decision-making process through a Nash bargaining procedure between public and private actors.

This paper examines the impact of rising wage rates on energy consumption mix in rural China. Using a unique panel data set from our two-round surveys of 409 rural households in 4 provinces, the results show that the wage rate at the village level has a significant negative impact on traditional biomass energy consumption and significant positive effects on consumption of electricity and new renewable energy in rural China. As traditional biomass energy is mainly collected with family labor and is relatively labor intensive, an increase in rural wage rates would enhance the opportunity costs of traditional biomass energy, leading to a reduction in biomass energy consumption. Continuously rising rural wage rates could accelerate the transition from biomass energy to electricity in rural areas. These findings could have important policy implications, not only for indoor air quality and environmental and health issues in rural areas but also for greater security in rural energy supply and policies to incentive farmers to better utilize biomass resource after harvest.","[Qiu, Huanguang; Yan, Jianbiao] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Lei, Zhen] Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sun, Dingqiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1 Weigang Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Sun, DQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1 Weigang Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dqsun@njau.edu.cn,"Lei, Zhen/JOJ-8587-2023","Lei, Zhen/0000-0002-6544-023X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473122, 71333008, 71473255]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71473122; No. 71333008; No. 71473255) and A project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

We analyse this in the context of the Nordic countries where Norway and Sweden are likely to gain hydropower potential and Finland is likely to experience transnational impacts. We use an economic simulation model and a dynamic optimization model to study the impact of climate change to the production mix, the price of electricity, consumption of electricity and emissions from electricity production. We show that climate change might reduce prices through increased renewables supply, which decreases the profitability of power production. The changes in the inflow profile affect the hydropower profiles over the hydrological year such that the reduced inflow peak in the spring shifts the hydropower production from spring to autumn and winter. In addition the larger inflow increases the share of hydropower in production mix over the year. The emissions per consumed energy unit is going to be decreased because of the decreasing share of the thermal production in the system. However, increased hydropower production reduces prices which in turn increases the quantity demanded. This rebound effect somewhat dampens the emission reduction.","[Huuki, Hannu; Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria] Univ Oulu, Dept Econ, POB 4600, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Hilden, Mikael; Huuki, Hannu; Kivisaari, Visa; Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria] Univ Oulu, Finnish Environm Inst, POB 413, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria] Univ Oulu, Martti Ahtisaari Inst Global Business & Econ, POB 4600, Oulu 90014, Finland",University of Oulu; University of Oulu; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Oulu,"Kopsakangas-Savolainen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Finnish Environm Inst, POB 413, Oulu 90014, Finland.",maria.kopsakangas-savolainen@ymparisto.fi,,"Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria/0000-0003-2110-9307",Academy of Finland Regulation and Dynamic pricing for Flexible Energy Systems (REDYFLEX-project) [AKA285944]; Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Large Scale Variable Distributed Energy Solution (BC-DC-project) [AKA292854],Academy of Finland Regulation and Dynamic pricing for Flexible Energy Systems (REDYFLEX-project); Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Large Scale Variable Distributed Energy Solution (BC-DC-project),We are grateful for the financial support from the Academy of Finland Regulation and Dynamic pricing for Flexible Energy Systems (REDYFLEX-project AKA285944) and Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council Cloud Computing as an Enabler of Large Scale Variable Distributed Energy Solution (BC-DC-project AKA292854).,,48,12,12,2,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,418,425,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.039,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800041,0

Unusually, it examines beliefs about positive and negative statements about fracking as well as support/opposition. A majority of respondents correctly answered an initial question testing basic knowledge of shale gas extraction. More respondents supported fracking in Britain (36%) than opposed it (32%) but only 22% supported fracking locally, while 45% were opposed. Respondents were more united in negative beliefs than positive beliefs about fracking. More knowledgeable participants held more polarised views and were significantly more likely than others to agree with negative statements and to oppose fracking in their local area. More respondents disagreed than agreed that it is possible to compensate for fracking risks by payments to local communities. Policy implications include: increasing public knowledge about fracking will not necessarily lead to more positive beliefs and support regarding shale gas developments; promoting alleged economic benefits of shale gas is not enough to ensure support; engaging in genuinely inclusive participatory decision-making may be more likely to increase support than offering payments to communities; alternatively, developing more renewable energy capacity promises to be more popular than fracking.","[Howell, Rachel A.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Howell, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland.",rachel.howell@ed.ac.uk,,"Howell, Rachel/0000-0002-0932-6491",Climate Change Consortium of Wales,Climate Change Consortium of Wales,This research was funded by the Climate Change Consortium of Wales.

Earlier research has provided snapshots of existing barriers and motives, but not analyzed changes over time, as is done here. Between 2008 and 2014, the PV market in Sweden changed profoundly, with the introduction of subsidies and changes in rules, making it easier for households to sell electricity they produce. At the same time, regulations have increased for the households. Environmental motives have been consistent over the years. Financial incentives had become an important motive by 2014-2016. The investment cost remained a barrier, even though it has been reduced over the years. New barriers in the second period are problems relating to increased administrative burden and finding information about market conditions such as which companies exist and how much a household will be paid when selling,electricity to the grid. In 2008-2009, households installed the PV panels on their own and installation was a major barrier. This had changed radically by 2014-2016, when most of the households studied bought turnkey systems with installation included.","[Palm, Jenny] Lund Univ, IIIEE, Box 196, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Palm, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, IIIEE, Box 196, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Jenny.palm@iiiee.lu.se,"Palm, Jenny/F-2411-2014","Palm, Jenny/0000-0001-7694-7397",Swedish Energy Agency [37511-1],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency),This work was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency under Grant no. 37511-1.,,33,126,132,5,114,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.047,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,Green Accepted,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500001,0

Additionally, electric car users themselves may pose a risk of overloading the grid in the event of a mass evacuation. We highlight the issues of electric vehicle use during an evacuation event, not to discourage adoption, but to raise awareness of the issues so that public policy makers can take them into consideration.

Globalization, by making the national economy open to the free movement of all types of resources and vulnerable, is a rather controversial process. The acceleration of commodity-money relations and the increase in the scale of capital overflow, on the one hand, conceals the potential of economic growth and serves as its additional factor, on the other - increases the risk factors and uncertainties, creates serious threats to national interests. There is an acute contradiction between globalization and the national interests of many States. Threats to national security arise from the different levels of economic, social and political development of countries, which increasingly widens the gaps between rich and poor countries. The initial inequality in the technological development of countries determines the further redistribution of benefits in favour of transnational corporations of developed countries. In assessing the immediate prospects of globalization, the following can be noted: the absence of supranational regulators of globalization can cause further aggravation of the long-term development of the world economy; the current trend in the near future may be the regionalization of economies and the development of protectionist measures; globalization is accompanied by increased instability of the world economy and the deepening of its uneven development.","[Altunyan, Armen G.; Urazgaliev, Vladimir S.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia; [Menshikova, Galina A.] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Social Management & Planning, Fac Sociol, Smolnogo Str 1-3,9 Th Entrance, St Petersburg 191124, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Altunyan, AG (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",dioskuriya-box@mail.ru; uvsh54@yandex.ru; menshikova.g.a@mail.ru,"Urazgaliev, Vladimir/HPC-3429-2023; Urazgaliev, Vladimir/M-4294-2015","Urazgaliev, Vladimir/0000-0002-7794-4937;",,,,,34,0,0,0,7,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2462,2468,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300315,0

Because of transmission and distribution losses, and theft, not all the electricity that is generated is eventually consumed, making it necessary to investigate the impact of electricity generation on growth. Second, we disentangle the impact of total electricity generation on growth into renewable and nonrenewable effects. With increasing pursuit of energy security, technological advances, the falling costs of renewables, and the movement to exploit renewable energy sources for electrification, there is need to study not only the impact of traditional sources of electricity but renewable sources, as well. Third, we deviate from previous studies that focus on granger causality and/or cointegration by estimating the effect of electricity generation on growth using the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Given that electricity generation and many of the other regressors in our model may be jointly determined with GDP growth, the System GMM approach is appropriate to deal with these endogeneity issues. Fourth, we provide evidence of a link between electricity loss and economic growth. Our results indicate a strong positive and statistically significant relationship between renewable and nonrenewable electricity generation, and growth.","[Atems, Bebonchu; Hotaling, Chelsea] Clarkson Univ, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA",Clarkson University,"Atems, B (通讯作者)，Clarkson Univ, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",batems@clarkson.edu,,,,,,,45,76,77,0,62,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2018,112.0,,,,,,111,118,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.015,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FO2NK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416615800013,0

We also know that female labour participation rates were very high. The question, still unresolved, is whether these were due to employment opportunities or the inadequacy of male wages. The scarcity of data is one of the reasons for the persistence of this debate: wages series are not disaggregated by gender in the long term, there are discontinuities in wages data, and there are few family budgets available. Based on an analysis of the Municipal Population Census of 1924, this article provides new evidence related to female activity rates, the contribution of all household members to family income, and the expenses of working families in two regions with very different models of economic development: Catalonia and Galicia.","[Borderias, Cristina] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Munoz-Abeledo, Luisa] Univ Santiago Compostela, Santiago, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Borderías, C (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,77,8,8,0,0,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The results clearly demonstrate the robustness of the gravity model. Furthermore, path dependence within the context of regional development, due to the historical partitions of Poland, still plays a significant and robust role. Trade persistence has been confirmed.

These forces need to be thoroughly re-evaluated and recognized when there is a need for change. Equally important is the timing of the change, the determination of the alternation of the change process, the selection of the change process (methods) in relation to the constraints, the monitoring of the change process and its evaluation in terms of the achieved results. The process is dynamic, and each implementation of the sequence of steps can cause further changes. That is why this process is demanding and still open. The success of implementing change depends on the style of managers' thinking, on the ability of the manager to choose the right people for the whole change process. Very important for managing change is the ability of the manager to inspire and motivate members of the change team. The aim of the paper is to compare the change management approach in small and large enterprises under the conditions of the market economy, the globalization process and the dynamically developing environment of the SR in which businesses operate. At the same time, it is about defining changes affecting the management; the methods they use, and how to push changes in the organization.","[Chlebikova, Darina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Chlebikova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",darina.chlebikova@fpedas.uniza.sk,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2067,2074,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300264,0

The analyses are based on two random-effects logistic models with sample selection. Results show that the functional breadth of a subsidiary's inter-organizational network has an inverted U'-shaped relationship with its radical and incremental innovation performance.

This results in prosperity and growth. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the employees adequately. In addition to the basic salary the employee receives each month for their work, they can increase their valuation by variable wage components. They are motivational components that help to increase productivity and quality of work and motivate the employee for better work performance, self-education, and so on. Employees can therefore be credited with various salaries, bonuses, personal appraisals, surcharges, compensation or wage benefits for overtime work, holidays, night work, and so on.

Understanding and modeling their effect is an ongoing challenge as there are plenty of surface structures caused by intention, manufacturing, or wear which have different or even contrary effects on the boundary layer flow. Scale-resolving simulations like direct numerical simulations are a valuable tool in this context as they provide highly-resolved view of the local effect of roughness on the flow. However, complex surface structures pose challenges to the generation of commonly used body-fitted structured computational grids. Immersed boundary methods (IBM) are a promising tool for bypassing this challenge. In this paper the IBM implemented in the CFD-solver OpenFOAM is qualified for scale-resolving simulations of turbulent channel flows over rough surfaces by introducing an additional mass-flow controller. By means of three characteristic test-cases the direct numerical simulations with IBM are verified against corresponding simulations with body-fitted grids. The excellent quantitative prediction of average flow quantities as well as turbulent statistics demonstrate the suitability of the method for the simulation of turbulent flows over arbitrary complex rough surfaces.","[Hartung, Konrad M.] Jade Univ Appl Sci, Inst Energy & Proc Engn, D-26389 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Gilge, Philipp; Herbst, Florian] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Turbomachinery & Fluid Dynam, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Jade University of Applied Sciences; Leibniz University Hannover,"Hartung, KM (通讯作者)，Jade Univ Appl Sci, Inst Energy & Proc Engn, D-26389 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",konrad.hartung@jade-hs.de; gilge@tfd.uni-hannover.de; herbst@tfd.uni-hannover.de,"Herbst, Florian/HGD-8508-2022","Herbst, Florian/0000-0003-0993-4582",German Research Foundation (DFG) [(CRC)871],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work has been conducted within the framework of subproject B3 entitled Influence of complex surface structures on the aerodynamic loss behaviour of blades of the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC)871 Regeneration of Complex Capital Goods funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

The paper examines the effect of localization externalities on innovation. Localization externalities are measured as industry specialization or a firm's co-location in a relatively high own-industry employment region. By analyzing a large dataset of 6697 firms integrated with another regional agglomeration-related dataset, results show that (1) co-location in an agglomeration has a positive influence on a firm's innovative performance; and (2) firms benefit heterogeneously from agglomerations, with benefits being distributed asymmetrically.

German exports to the EU countries have been slowly declining since 2012, while exports outside the EU have increased significantly since 2009 (an average of 452 thousand kg per month in 2014). Concerning the development of milk and dairy products trade throughout the EU, imports from non-EU countries are rather steady, while exports outside the EU are steadily increasing, even though there are some barriers (market protection in Switzerland or Canada, embargo on import to Russia, etc.) of exports. The Netherlands is a major exporter of butter on intra-EU markets where the value of butter exports almost doubled between periods before 2009 and post-quota abolition in 2015. With regard to exports of butter outside the EU, the Netherlands together with France and Ireland also have the highest share.

In this longitudinal study, residents of a wind farm in Lower Saxony were interviewed on two occasions (2012, 2014) and given the opportunity to use audio equipment to record annoying noise. On average, both the wind farm and road traffic were somewhat annoying. More residents complained about physical and psychological symptoms due to traffic noise (16%) than to WT noise (10%, two years later 7%). Noise annoyance was minimally correlated with distance to the closest WT and sound pressure level, but moderately correlated with fair planning. The acoustic analysis identified amplitude-modulated noise as a major cause of the complaints.

According FAO, food security can be defined as a situation, when all people have availability and access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for a healthy life. This paper focuses on indicators falling under four pillars of food security: availability, access, utility, and risk. Food security indicators for all CEECs are described and their development in time is evaluated. The paper specifically focuses on demand for food and demand for quality of food. Demand elasticities for food and their development over time is a good indicator of access to food for different segments of the population. Access to food depends on food prices and incomes, which are significantly affected by the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union as well as development of prices on the global commodity markets. In many CEECs access to food has been improving. However, demand for quality of food is still a problem due to income limitations for low-income segments of the population in all CEECs. This is specifically an issue to be dealt with as diet quality is strongly linked to health. The paper uses Household Budget Survey data for selected countries of CEE.","[Pokrivcak, Jan; Bielekova, Eva] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Nitra, Slovakia; [Cupak, Andrej] Natl Bank Slovakia, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; National Bank of Slovakia,"Bieleková, E (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Nitra, Slovakia.",jan.pokrivcak@uniag.sk; eva.bielekova@uniag.sk; andrej.cupak@nbs.sk,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014",,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-16-0321]; Scientific Grant Agency VEGA [1/0928/17],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Scientific Grant Agency VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-16-0321 and the Scientific Grant Agency VEGA No. 1/0928/17.,,18,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1291,1299,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300166,0

Using data from BLS, Brookings Analysis of Census Bureau, Moody's data, U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Department of Labor, we performed analyses and made estimates regarding share of workers in each type of alternative work arrangement, the percentage of all U.S. workers who are either self-employed or hold multiple jobs, non-employer business growth by industry (2003-2018), and non-employer firms and employment (U.S.). Empirical and secondary data are used to support the claim that the sharing economy deals with the short-run rental of a certain service. As a result of the service-focused character of the sharing economy, service suppliers should provide first-rate service quality as they have a direct communication with the customers. Such suppliers in the sharing economy are not accountable for any marketing proposals as this is regulated by the service enabler. In the sharing economy, agents employ digital technologies to convert their capital or labor assets into cash by proposing them to their peers as short-run rental units. The sharing economy facilitates value transfer by adequately harmonizing time and money: it is time saving for customers via availability, brings about monetary value for service suppliers who provide their assets, and offers both time and money for service facilitators.","[Popescu, Gheorghe H.; Ciurlau, Florin Cristian] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Fac Banking & Finance, Splaiul Unirii 176, Bucharest 030134, Romania; [Androniceanu, Armenia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Adm & Publ Management, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Mitea, Dana Raluca Elena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Management, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Andrei, Jean-Vasile] Petr Gas Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Bucuresti Bvd 39, Ploiesti 100680, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Oil & Gas University of Ploiesti,"Popescu, GH (通讯作者)，Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Fac Banking & Finance, Splaiul Unirii 176, Bucharest 030134, Romania.",gheorghe.h.popescu@gmail.com; armenia.androniceanu@man.ase.ro; dana.mitea@gmail.com; cristianciurlau@yahoo.co; andrei_jeanvasile@yahoo.com,"Androniceanu, Armenia/AAC-4697-2020; Jean-Vasile, Andrei/A-5270-2011","Jean-Vasile, Andrei/0000-0002-8332-6537",,,,,25,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,297,302,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300040,0

The quality of education and its adjustment to contemporary requirements of the market becomes vital to the reduction of unemployment. The aim of this article is to present labour market situation in the selected countries, taking into account the level of education and the influence of globalization. Statistical methods were used to analyze this phenomenon. The moving average calculations have been conducted to assess the overall development trend and the average rate of change was determined based on individual chain base dynamics indexes. Data concerning the employment and unemployment rates according to the level of education and sex from Eurostat and national statistical institutes (the Central Statistics Office and Instituto Nacional de Estadistica) was used in the study. The initial data verification let us observe an opposite trend in Poland and Spain in relation to both ratios. The results of the analysis will allow us to verify the hypothesis that nowadays, women are more tailored to the needs of labour market and that level of education influences the unemployment rate.

Behavior of consumers is evaluated based on two surveys. It is a survey mapping the possibility of purchasing food for gluten-free diet, which was carried out from October 2016 to January 2017 (1,524 respondents), and research mapping criteria for buying bakery products, which was implemented in January and February 2018 (302 respondents). The aim of the paper is to identify, based on the dependence of the selected characters, the characters that present a specific model of consumer behavior when buying bakery products in the Czech Republic. The most inadequate type of food, where most of the celiacs are missing the larger variety of the assortment, is fresh pastry. The needs of this specific growing group should be taken into account. Among the examined dependencies, for example, it was confirmed that consumption is dependent on age and education. Furthermore, it was confirmed that consumers prefer pre-pricing quality and least impact on sales in action. Comparison with the world issues, suggestions of options, recommendations that could lead to better meeting the customers' needs resulting from their preferences in the purchase of bakery products in the Czech Republic are part of the article.","[Salkova, Daniela; Regnerova, Olga] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Sálková, D (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",salkova@pef.czu.cz; oregnerova@pef.czu.cz,"Regnerová, Olga/B-6291-2018; Šálková, Daniela/H-4401-2018",,Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague [20171014],Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague,"This article was supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) FEM CULS in Prague, No. 20171014 -Optimizing distribution of food intended for special nutrition with a focus on gluten-free products.",,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,885,891,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300115,0

Research methods cover the comparative analysis of scientific literature documents and reports as well as statistical data. The paper points out that over the last several years the profits of cooperative banks have been decreasing thereby limiting their ability to increase equity through accumulation of profit. The main source of funding for cooperative banks are deposits from the non-financial sector. Liquidity risk or funding risk refers to the ability of funds when needed. The bank liquidity risk was reduced by implementation of Institutional Protection Scheme (IPS) based on associations of Polish cooperative banks. However, over 12% of cooperative banks stayed out of IPS at the end of 2017 and 4 cooperative banks failed to carry out this minimum capital requirements set up by Polish Financial Supervision Authority. We further find that bank ownership structures influence their lending behaviors. The availability of subsidized agriculture loans and cooperative bank lending policies are an important source of funding for the agriculture sector and the rural community.","[Soloma, Andrzej; Skorwider-Namiotko, Jaroslaw; Wyszynski, Artur] Uniwers Warmia & Mazury Olsztyn, Fac Econ, Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",,"Soloma, A (通讯作者)，Uniwers Warmia & Mazury Olsztyn, Fac Econ, Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",soloma@uwm.edu.pl; skorwider@uwm.edu.pl; arturwy@uwm.edu.pl,,"Skorwider-Namiotko, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-2401-2204; Wyszynski, Artur/0000-0002-3326-7399",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1824,1830,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300233,0

One of these variables is personal values that are guidelines for doing the ethical behavior. Personal values play an important role in the ethical decision-making process. In this study, we examined the effects of business students' terminal and instrumental values on the ethical decision-making process. We considered ethical decision-making process as an ethical awareness, ethical orientation, and ethical intention. In order to measure ethical awareness, we tested whether a particular action was ethical/unethical based on ethical theories like justice, deontology, utilitarianism, relativism. Students' intentions to perform ethical behaviors were measured by the probability of doing questionable action. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of personal values on the students' ethical decision-making criteria and intention to perform the ethical behavior. For this purpose, we used a self-administrated questionnaire method in order to collect data from business department students in Turkey. The 406 usable questionnaires were received from the voluntarily participated students in this research. During the analysis process, Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) analysis method was used. The analysis results reveal that an instrumental value positively affects the students' ethical decision-making criteria.

The numerical solution of such model is not trivial but the combination of the Finite difference and Rung-Kutta's method can be used for this task. The adaptivity of the controller is satisfied by the recursive identification of the external linear model as a linear representation of the originally nonlinear system. Control synthesis employs a polynomial approach together with the connection to the Pole-placement method and the spectral factorization satisfies basic control requirements and provides not only the structure of the controller but also computational relations.

The fundamental scientific works of Russian and foreign scientists in the field of international banking, state regulation of the activity of credit organizations served as a methodological and theoretical basis for the study. Dialectical and systemic approaches made it possible to reveal the features of international financial globalization in modern conditions, to identify trends in the development of the banking sector and the institutions for their regulation in post-crisis conditions. The information base of the research was national and international regulatory legal documents in the field of banking sector and financial markets regulation, publications in Russian and in international economic literature on banking regulation, the strategy of the banking system development in the Russian Federation, increasing its sustainability and competitiveness. Information sources included the materials of the Federal State Statistics Service, analytical materials of the World Bank and the Bank of Russia, analytical conclusions and reviews prepared by the Institute for the Economy in Transition. The novelty of the study is to determine the ways for the effective development of the national banking system in the context of international financial globalization.","[Zinovyeva, Ekaterina Georgievna; Koptyakova, Svetlana Vladimirovna] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Magnitogorsk, Russia",Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University,"Zinovyeva, EG; Koptyakova, SV (通讯作者)，Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Magnitogorsk, Russia.",ekaterina_7707@mail.ru; svetlana.cop@yandex.ru,"Zinovyeva, Ekaterina/C-4986-2016; Koptyakova, Svetlana/AAR-9053-2020","Koptyakova, Svetlana/0000-0002-7296-1500",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1951,1958,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300249,0

The array of existing approaches is large and overwhelming, resulting in companies not understanding what corporate sustainability really means for their businesses. Considering environmental, economic and social issues, this paper aims at assessing the performance of the Brazilian electricity power industry in terms of its sustainability performance. An analysis of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators for the energy sector lead to an assessment of its sustainability performance by applying Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) specified with a directional distance function (DDF). Five scenarios were created: (i) Flexible weights; (ii) Triple bottom line; (iii) Social issues; (iv) Economic issues; and (v) Environmental issues. With considering (i) flexibility weights, almost all companies are efficient. We also found a significant difference when we compared (i) with the other four scenarios (ii, iii, iv and v). Taking into account the triple bottom line scenario (ii), the results indicate that companies were less efficient when compared with the flexible weights scenario (i). Taking into account the last three scenarios (iii, iv and v), only four companies were considered as providing top benchmarks in sustainability performance.","[Sartori, Simone] Ctr Univ Brusque UNIFEBE, Brusque, SC, Brazil; [Witjes, Sjors] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Campos, Lucila M.

The systems input-output analysis method is adopted to trace the direct and indirect energy use associated with both intermediate production and final consumption activities in the economic system. In the world economy, 15% of the energy use embodied in trade turns out to be induced by final consumption, and 85% is attributed to intermediate production. Different trading patterns for different economies are identified with the separation between energy trade for intermediate production and that for final consumption. For Japan with a production-oriented trading pattern, intermediate trade should be a top priority in local trade structure adjustment, while final trade needs more attention for the government in the United States as the country is in a consumption-oriented trade pattern. This analysis aims to provide an in-depth insight into energy sustainability, as well as a sound scientific reference for policy making at the regional, national and global scale.","[Wu, X.

The aim is not to predict how this trade-off will be resolved in practice, but rather to lay out what is at stake on both sides of the equation. Since the late 2000s the electricity market in GB has become increasingly integrated with continental European markets through market coupling and increasing interconnection capacity, with further integration expected up to the mid-2020s. Estimates of the economic benefits of this integration range up to the order of several (sic)100 m to (sic)1bn a year, representing the economic cost of a reversal of such integration. On the other hand, maintaining and expanding electricity market integration would require the acceptance of electricity policies and regulations made in European institutions in which UK actors would have little if any voice. An intermediate multilateral approach offering the possibility of retaining market integration with less cost in terms of influence is proposed.","[Lockwood, Matthew; Dutton, Joseph] Univ Exeter, Energy Policy Grp, Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Froggatt, Antony; Wright, Georgina] Royal Inst Int Affairs, Chatham House,10 St Jamess Sq, London SW1Y 4LE, England",University of Exeter,"Lockwood, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Energy Policy Grp, Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",m.lockwood@exeter.ac.uk,,"Lockwood, Matthew/0000-0003-2380-3300",Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research formed part of the programme of the UK Energy Research Centre, Phase 3, and was supported by the Research Councils UK under the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council award EP/L024756/1.",,28,15,15,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,137,143,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.021,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800014,0

The implementation of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) is one of the measures to improve building energy efficiency. Using the Global Change Assessment Model, this study assesses growth in the buildings sector and impacts of building energy policies in Gujarat, which would help the state adopt ECBC and expand building energy efficiency programs. Without building energy policies, building energy use in Gujarat would grow by 15 times in commercial buildings and 4 times in urban residential buildings between 2010 and 2050. ECBC improves energy efficiency in commercial buildings and could reduce building electricity use in Gujarat by 20% in 2050, compared to the no policy scenario. Having energy codes for both commercial and residential buildings could result in additional 10% savings in electricity use. To achieve these intended savings, it is critical to build capacity and institution for robust code implementation.","[Yu, Sha; Tan, Qing; Evans, Meredydd; Kyle, Page; Vu, Linh; Patel, Pralit L.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Yu, S (通讯作者)，Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",Sha.Yu@pnnl.gov; qing.tan@pnnl.gov; m.evans@pnnl.gov; pkyle@pnal.gov; linh.vu@pnnl.gov; pralitpatel@pnnl.gov,"Evans, Meredydd/IST-7936-2023; Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022","Evans, Meredydd/0000-0001-5369-151X; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358",U.S. Department of Energy; DOE by Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC05-76RL01830],U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE by Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This work was supported by U.S. Department of Energy.

Based on China's current stage on food security and changing biofuel demands, this paper selected agro-environmental and socio-economic factors of biofuel production, and simulated and spatially allocated areas suited for biofuel production under the two scenarios of planning-oriented scenario (PoS) and biofuel-oriented scenario (BoS) by the target year 2020. It also estimated biofuel production potentials and zones across China's provinces. The results show that land suited for biofuel production is primarily located in Northwestern, Northern, Northeastern, Central and Southwestern China, with relatively good agro-environmental conditions and medium population density, but also lower competition with crop production, aiming at facilitating governmental policy-making and multi-purpose allocation of land.","[Zhang, Jianjun; Chen, Yang; Rao, Yongheng; Fu, Meichen] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianjun; Fu, Meichen] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Land Consolidat & Rehabil, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianjun; Prishchepov, Alexander V.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark",China University of Geosciences - Beijing; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; University of Copenhagen,"Zhang, JJ (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhangjianjun_bj@126.com,"Prishchepov, Alexander/H-6708-2012","Prishchepov, Alexander/0000-0003-2375-1651",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China Scholarship Council (CSC),Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This article is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and China Scholarship Council (CSC).

Despite the fact that the government of Taiwan has started to conduct research to advance technology related to offshore wind turbines, little attention has been paid to the establishment or adjustment of the legal framework and administrative mechanism that would permit effective and streamlined OWP development. Japan's administrative mechanisms are examined, and may be instructive; Lessons from the Japanese model include categorizing OWP under ocean policy rather than energy policy. Furthermore, a Headquarters for Ocean Policy was established as the highest coordinative and decision-making mechanism, and involves the Prime Minister, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of Ocean Policy and others, and they usually meet on a regular basis. Thus, a coordinative mechanism similar to that of Japan, be it the newly established Ocean Council or the reinstatement of the Commission for the Promotion of Marine Affairs, could be a workable solution to address current challenges and difficulties faced by the development of OWP in Taiwan.","[Kao, Shih-Ming] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Grad Inst Marine Affairs, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Pearre, Nathaniel S.] Dalhousie Univ, Renewable Energy Storage Lab, Halifax, NS, Canada",National Sun Yat Sen University; Dalhousie University,"Kao, SM (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Grad Inst Marine Affairs, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",kaosm@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,,"Pearre, Nathaniel/0000-0001-9345-8747",Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) under the project titled International Workshop on National Laws and Policy for Offshore Wind Energy [MOST-104-29164-110-009- A1],Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) under the project titled International Workshop on National Laws and Policy for Offshore Wind Energy,"The authors thank the funding support from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) under the project titled International Workshop on National Laws and Policy for Offshore Wind Energy (Project number MOST-104-29164-110-009- A1), as well as the assistance of Mr. Che-Hwa Chang relating to Japan's OWP development.",,61,18,18,0,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,463,472,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.027,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400044,0

The integrated model evaluates the need of flexibility services, under different conditions of renewable penetration. A case study of the Greek interconnected electric system is examined. Results show that the main flexibility needs concern photovoltaics causing the sunset effect, while the needs from stochastic wind are alleviated from the fact that wind output is de-linked from the demand evolution and that wind installations' positions are diversified. The identification of flexibility needs from the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) require detailed data to depict the spatial and technical characteristics of each power system, which can reveal that ramping rates, and not just the magnitude of ramping capacity, can be an important flexibility requirement, due to large single-hour ramp contribution in some months. Such an analysis can also reveal the options for increasing flexibility, which are power system specific.","[Koltsaklis, Nikolaos E.; Dagoumas, Athanasios S.; Panapakidis, Ioannis P.] Univ Piraeus, Sch Econ Business & Int Studies, Energy & Environm Policy Lab, Piraeus 18532, Greece; [Panapakidis, Ioannis P.] Technol Educ Inst Thessaly, Dept Elect Engn, Larisa 41110, Greece; [Koltsaklis, Nikolaos E.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Chem Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",University of Piraeus; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Dagoumas, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Sch Econ Business & Int Studies, Energy & Environm Policy Lab, Piraeus 18532, Greece.",dagoumas@unipi.gr,"Dagoumas, Athanasios/B-1116-2010; Panapakidis, Ioannis/AAP-1281-2021","Dagoumas, Athanasios/0000-0001-7524-5262; KOLTSAKLIS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0001-7717-981X","Public Power Corporation S.A through the research program of the Research Centre of the University of Piraeus, entitled Risk management of the Public Power Corporation S.A.

Political affiliation is one of the most consequential factors for a range of environmental and technological attitudes but it's relationship to policy preferences for unconventional oil and gas development is less understood. In this manuscript, we consider how political affiliation impacts unconventional oil and gas policy preferences. We develop a novel understanding of regulatory exaggeration we argue that conservative opposition to energy regulations is at least partly a result of a misjudgment of the stringency of current regulations. Statistical models, indicate that, while conservatives are opposed to unconventional oil and gas regulations in the abstract, they endorse a range of specific policies more stringent than those currently in place. Further, political conservativism is associated with paradoxically believing that current regulatory environment is too stringent and supporting more stringent, specific policies.","[Mayer, Adam] Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Mayer, Adam] Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Mayer, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Mayer, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",apmayer@rams.colostate.edu,,,Rural Sociological Society; Institute for Learning and Teaching at Colorado State University,Rural Sociological Society; Institute for Learning and Teaching at Colorado State University,"We thank the Rural Sociological Society and the Institute for Learning and Teaching at Colorado State University for financial support.

Market power is measured as the influence of the market share of the Big Six in a dynamic demand and supply VECM. The findings indicate that market power of the Big Six in the wholesale industry has a significant and large positive influence on the wholesale mark-up in the short-run. The long-run estimates support the arguments about 'revenue rebalancing' resulting from vertical integration. That is, low market power (and hence low revenues) in the wholesale industry leads to higher prices (hence higher revenues) in the retail industry. These findings are in contrast to the CMA's finding that no market power is exercised in the wholesale industry. Retail electricity prices are affected directly by both the wholesale and retail market concentration ratios in the long-run rather than indirectly through the wholesale mark-up. Overall, the findings in this paper provide support for the view that the UK electricity market exhibits significant anti-competitive conduct in both the retail and wholesale segments.","[Amountzias, Chrysovalantis; Dagdeviren, Hulya; Patokos, Tassos] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Dagdeviren, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England.",h.dagdeviren@herts.ac.uk,"; Dagdeviren, Hulya/C-1679-2016","Amountzias, Chrysovalantis/0000-0002-7013-7032; Dagdeviren, Hulya/0000-0002-4606-2042",,,,,45,21,23,3,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,467,473,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.016,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800044,0

We contribute to the literature by using a choice experiment to rank and quantify household preferences for electricity services in two indigenous villages in Sarawak, Malaysia. Specifically, we disaggregated electricity services into five attributes: private use for household appliances and lighting, public use for community facilities, productive use for income generation, the operator model and the monthly tariff. We found that the most value was placed on the operator-model underpinning the provision of electricity services and that there was a strong preference for a community-based model over a utility-based model. Interestingly, our results suggest that the preference for a community-based operator model may be related to the experience of using electricity for productive uses. We contend that our results demonstrate the importance of social and institutional challenges to providing electricity services to indigenous communities in Sarawak and highlight the need for the state utility to engage with indigenous communities to overcome these challenges.","[van Gevelt, T.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Holzeis, C.

To concretely reflect the cross-scale effect between China and the rest of the world, embodied energy intensity of foreign imports is provided on the basis of our recent work on the world economy, in contrast to the conventional assumption of the same intensity for both the foreign and domestic trade. In 2012, the energy embodied in gross fixed capital formation is found to constitute nearly half of the total energy use in China, three-quarters larger than the total household consumption. Approximately 40% of energy resources embodied in final use turn out to be imported from foreign regions, twice the share of the direct energy imports in total energy consumption recorded by traditional direct accounting. The trade imbalance in energy use is illustrated with the support of the law of comparative advantage. In addition to economic benefits, hidden social impacts, including indirect external dependence and health costs associated with non-energy trade, should also be considered by the government in industrial structure adjustment. The present embodiment study is expected to be remarkably supportive for sustainable energy policy making in China.","[Wu, X. F.; Chen, G.

Interregional carbon leakage and carbon transfer have a significant impact on the realization of carbon emission mitigation targets and the allocation of responsibility. Using China's interregional input-output tables and the corresponding carbon emission data for 2007 and 2010, this paper proposes an interregional Ghosh input-output model and estimates the amount of interprovincial carbon emission transfer from the supply-side perspective. We find that the main direction of supply-side carbon emission transfer is from resource-intensive provinces in the central and western regions to developed provinces in the eastern coastal regions. Further analysis shows that the transfer is mainly concentrated in the production and distribution of electricity and heat, nonmetallic mineral products, and basic metals, whose carbon emissions account for approximately 70% of all sectors' carbon emissions. The differences between the supply side and the demand side of China's provinces are mainly reflected in the transfer out of carbon emissions.","[Xie, Rui] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Hu, Guangxiao] Peking Univ, Sch Environm & Energy, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Youguo] Inst Quantitat & Tech Econ CASS, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Terr Sovereignty & Maritim, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Hunan University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Terr Sovereignty & Maritim, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xrxrui@126.com; huguangxiao@pku.edu.cn; zhyouguo@cass.org.cn; Liuyu@casipm.ac.cn,"XIE, rui/JXR-6421-2024","HU, GUANGXIAO/0000-0001-7308-5947; Xie, Rui/0000-0001-9300-7145","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303076, 71673083, 71603124, 71473242]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602500]; Major Consulting Program of Institutes of Science and Development of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y02015003]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Major Consulting Program of Institutes of Science and Development of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers: 71303076, 71673083, 71603124, 71473242), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant numbers: 2016YFA0602500) and the Major Consulting Program of Institutes of Science and Development of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant numbers: Y02015003).",,33,44,49,17,132,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,688,697,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.021,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200068,0

While policy analyses often invoke assumptions of power plant book life, relatively little analysis has focused on the physical life of power-generating assets. The average age of the U.S. generator fleet has increased significantly over time despite continued investment, in part because more recent investment has tended to focus on shorter-lived assets. This may be due in part to risk-averse power sector investors and lenders responding rationally to regulatory uncertainty in a deregulated market environment. Power plant retirement trends suggest that the pace of retirements will increase significantly in the decade after 2030 for most reasonable estimates of physical life. These capital investment trends have important consequences for carbon policy and highlight the importance of including consideration of the longer term particularly when evaluating more significant decarbonization policies.","[Rode, David C.; Fischbeck, Paul S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Fischbeck, Paul S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Paez, Antonio R.] DAI Management Consultants Inc, 1 Vet Way,Suite 200, Carnegie, PA 15106 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Rode, DC (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",rode@andrew.cmu.edu; fischbeck@cmu.edu; apaez@daimc.com,,"Rode, David/0000-0003-1028-8506",,,,,48,17,21,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,222,232,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.058,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600023,0

Poverty is a key underlying factor. However, poor quality domestic energy technologies, including stoves, heaters and light sources contribute to this vulnerability. The problem is compounded by behavioural and environmental factors. Since cooking is a key energy-using chore, access to efficient, safe and versatile stoves portend safety improvements. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of eleven technological and usability attributes (CO emissions, firepower, efficiency, fuel toxicity, fuel cost, stove price, controllability, durability, availability, temperature of touchable-parts, and mechanical stability) of commercially available stoves that utilise four energy sources (kerosene, methanol, ethanol gel, and LPG). The ensuing discussion serves as a guide to enable the selection of the best-fit stove-fuel combination for low-income households. The findings indicate that LPG stoves have comparatively better overall rankings for cleanliness, firepower, safety, and durability. This analysis highlights that no combustion technology is risk-proof and there remains a burden on users to exercise diligence. We recommend that South Africa adopts an affirmative policy and strategic actions that discourage the use of kerosene as a household combustion fuel, and promotes the adoption of LPG as a safer and practical alternative.","[Kimemia, David] Univ South Africa, Inst Social & Hlth Sci, VIPRU, SA Med Res Council, POB 1087, ZA-1820 Lenasia, South Africa; [Van Niekerk, Ashley] Univ South Africa, VIPRU, Inst Social & Hlth Sci, SA Med Res Council, POB 19070, ZA-7505 Tygerberg, South Africa",University of South Africa; South African Medical Research Council; South African Medical Research Council; University of South Africa,"Kimemia, D (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Inst Social & Hlth Sci, VIPRU, SA Med Res Council, POB 1087, ZA-1820 Lenasia, South Africa.",dkimemia@gmail.com; ashley.vanniekerk@mrc.ac.za,,"van Niekerk, Ashley/0000-0003-2900-8519; Kimemia, David/0000-0002-5790-8541",University of South Africa,University of South Africa,We are grateful to prof Harold Annegarn and prof Mohamed Seedat for review inputs on the stove testing protocols and the draft paper.

We conducted total cost of ownership (TCO) calculations to study how costs and sales of EVs relate to each other and to examine the role of fiscal incentives in reducing TCO and increasing EV sales. We composed EV-ICE vehicle pairs that allowed cross-segment and cross-country comparison in eight European countries. Actual car prices were used to calculate the incentives for each model in each country. We found a negative TCO-sales relationship that differs across car segments. Compared to their ICE vehicle pair, big EVs have lower TCO, higher sales, and seem to be less price responsive than small EVs. Three country groups can be distinguished according to the level of fiscal incentives and their impact on TCO and EV sales. In Norway, incentives led to the lowest TCO for the EVs. In the Netherlands, France, and UK the TCO of EVs is close to the TCO of the ICE pairs. In the other countries the TCO of EVs exceeds that of the ICE vehicles. We found that exemptions from flat taxes favour big EVs, while lump-sum subsidies favour small EVs.","[Levay, Petra Zsuzsa; Drossinos, Yannis; Thiel, Christian] Joint Res Ctr European Commission, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",,"Lévay, PZ (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",petra.levay@uantwerpen.be; yannis.drossinos@ec.europa.eu; christian.thiel@ec.europa.eu,"Drossinos, Yannis/GLN-5650-2022","Thiel, Christian/0000-0001-6439-5775",,,,,56,200,214,15,109,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,524,533,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.054,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900050,0

The asymmetric solution that concentrates all transit traffic in one suburb is better but can only be realized if the authority over the local roads is transferred to the central authority.","[Proost, Stef] KULeuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Leuven, Belgium; [Proost, Stef] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Westin, Jonas] Umea Univ, Ctr Reg Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",KU Leuven; Royal Institute of Technology; Umea University,"Proost, S (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Ctr Econ Studies, Leuven, Belgium.;Proost, S (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Transport Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",stef.proost@kuleuven.be; jonas.westin@umu.se,"Westin, Jonas K/F-9923-2011","Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",EIB project; OT - KULeuven project,EIB project; OT - KULeuven project,We would like to thank Joel Franklin for helpful discussions and Stef Proost thanks the EIB project and OT - KULeuven project for financial support.,,22,1,1,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Because of the geographical environments, economies of scales, social structures, and diverse political ideologies in Taiwan, the electricity market exhibits unique characteristics. To maximize the benefits of electricity liberalization, future market operations must not only involve conventional considerations for economic dispatch; overall social welfare should be included by incorporating the perspectives of fairness, responsibility, and the environment, and key electrical grid operations should be executed appropriately. We responded to the future market liberalization planning by including factors, such as, environmental effects and government policies, in addition to electrical line construction, and operation cost factors involved in the entire operational model planning. On the basis of responsibility sharing, this study used the simulated -responsibility three-phase pricing method. The proposed pricing method is expected to help attain the following policy goals: 1. Achieving reasonable power price allocations; 2. Simultaneously ensuring fair and efficient electric grid operation; 3. Changing the operation orientations of the power plants and electrical grid facilities; and 4.

Based on historical developments and on counterfactual scenarios in which we assume that selected renewable technologies did not diffuse, we conclude that onshore and offshore wind energy have had a positive contribution to climate change mitigation since the beginning of their diffusion in EU27. In contrast, photovoltaic panels did not pay off from an environmental standpoint until very recently, since the benefits expected at the individual plant level were offset until 2013 by the CO2 emissions related to the construction and deployment of the next generation of panels. Considering the varied energy mixes and penetration rates of renewable energies in different areas, several countries can experience similar time gaps between the installation of the first renewable power plants and the moment in which the emissions from their infrastructure are offset. The analysis demonstrates that the time-profile of renewable energy emissions can be relevant for target setting and detailed policy design, particularly when renewable energy strategies are pursued in concert with carbon pricing through cap-and-trade systems.","[Usubiaga, Arkaitz; Acosta-Fernandez, Jose] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany; [Usubiaga, Arkaitz; McDowall, Will] UCL Inst Sustainable Resources, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Li, Francis G.

We show that the bivariate processes form a 1/2-null recurrent system. We also find that the convergence rate for the estimators for the coefficients in the outside regime is, while the convergence rate for the estimators for the coefficients in the middle regime is T-1/4. Moreover, we show that the convergence rate of the cointegrating coefficient is T, which is same as for the linear cointegration model. The Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that the estimators perform reasonably well in finite samples. Applying the proposed model to study the dynamic relationship between the federal funds rate and the 3-month Treasury bill rate, we find that cointegrating coefficients are the same for the two regimes while the short run loading coefficients are different.","[Cai, Biqing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Cai, Biqing; Tjostheim, Dag] Univ Bergen, Dept Math, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Gao, Jiti] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Bergen; Monash University,"Cai, BQ (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Cai, BQ (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Math, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",cbqywl@gmail.com; jiti.gao@monash.edu; Dag.Tjostheim@math.uib.no,,"Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021","University of Bergen; Norwegian Research Council; Australian Research Council [DP1096374, DP130104229]; Australian Research Council [DP1096374] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",University of Bergen; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank the Co-Editor, the associate editor, and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments and suggestions.

To analyse this situation, power markets are simulated over the long term with a System Dynamics model integrating new investment and closure decisions. This last trait is relevant to studying investment in power generation in mature markets undergoing policy shocks. The energy-only market design with a price cap, with and without a capacity mechanism, is compared to scarcity pricing in two investment behaviour scenarios with and without risk aversion. The results show that the three market designs lead to different levels of risk for peaking unit investment and results thus differ according to which risk aversion hypothesis is adopted. Assuming a risk-neutral investor, the results indicate that compared to an energy-only market with a price cap at 3 000 sic/MWh, an energy-only market with scarcity pricing and the market design with a capacity mechanism are two efficient options to reach similar levels of load loss. But under the hypothesis of risk aversion, the results highlight the advantage of the capacity mechanism over scarcity pricing.","[Petitet, Marie; Janssen, Tanguy] RTE, Markets Dept, 1 Terasse Bellini,TSA 41000, F-92929 La Defense, France; [Petitet, Marie; Finon, Dominique] Univ Paris 09, Univ Paris Dauphine, Chairs European Elect Markets, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Finon, Dominique] CIRED CNRS, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Petitet, M (通讯作者)，RTE, Markets Dept, 1 Terasse Bellini,TSA 41000, F-92929 La Defense, France.",marie.petitet@ensta.org,,"PETITET, Marie/0000-0002-8808-387X",European Electricity Markets Chair of the Paris Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot; Groupe Caisse des Depots,European Electricity Markets Chair of the Paris Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot; Groupe Caisse des Depots,"This paper has benefited from the support of the European Electricity Markets Chair of the Paris Dauphine Foundation, supported by RTE, EDF, EPEX Spot and the Groupe Caisse des Depots.",,39,49,56,2,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2017,103.0,,,,,,30,46,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.032,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397356000003,0

This study uses panel data on 29 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2012 to investigate the impact of fiscal decentralization on the functional mechanisms of environmental policy while controlling for the spatial correlations of carbon emission. The empirical results indicate that environmental policy alone can achieve the objective of reducing carbon emissions. However, the Chinese style fiscal decentralization makes the environmental policy significantly promote carbon emissions, leading to a green paradox. Moreover, we find that the impact of fiscal decentralization on environmental policy varies greatly among different geographical regions and the direct-controlled municipalities. In addition, our study confirms the spatial correlations in China's carbon emissions by using a spatial integration term. Finally, we recommend that emission reduction efforts should be incorporated into the local government's performance evaluation system to improve the institutional environment. Further, differentiated environmental policies and measures should be considered for different provinces to maximize the emission reduction potential.","[Zhang, Kun; Zhang, Zong-Yong; Liang, Qiao-Mei] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Kun; Zhang, Zong-Yong; Liang, Qiao-Mei] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Kun; Zhang, Zong-Yong; Liang, Qiao-Mei] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Liang, QM (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lqinhl@hotmail.com,"zhang, zongyong/HPC-1644-2023; Liang, Qiao-Mei/AAF-4556-2021; ZHANG, KUN/HLX-9251-2023","Zhang, Zongyong/0000-0002-6584-3397","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71461137006, 71422011, 71521002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, under Grant Nos. 71461137006, 71422011, and 71521002.

The Kyoto Protocol requirements and the European Union (EU) directives to promote the use of renewable energy sources (RES) together with environmental policies introduced for the development and use of alternative energies have generated a large number of market opportunities for this sector. Differences in the application of energy policies have caused significant imbalances in electricity systems and distortion of electricity prices. The main concern of governments is to define the support schemes to be used and how to combine them in the most profitable manner. The aim of this paper is to provide a comparative cost-effectiveness assessment using feed-in tariffs (FiT) and net-metering (NM) schemes in some representative EU countries. The authors have developed an economic model to evaluate the profitability of PV projects combining these support schemes. Results show not only the circumstances under which solar energy is economically profitable, but also the kind of PV systems, locations, minimum levels of tariff prices and specific combination of support schemes that should be promoted.","[Javier Ramirez, F.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Sch Ind Engn, Dept Business Adm, Av Espafia S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Honrubia-Escribano, A.; Gomez-Lazaro, E.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Renewable Energy Res Inst, Av Espaiia S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Honrubia-Escribano, A.; Gomez-Lazaro, E.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, DIEEAC EDII AB, Av Espaiia S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Pham, Due T.] Univ Birmingham, Coll Engn & Phys Sci, Dept Mech Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Birmingham,"Ramírez, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Sch Ind Engn, Dept Business Adm, Av Espafia S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain.",franciscoj.ramirez@uclm.es; andres.honrubia@uclm.es; emilio.gomez@uclm.es; D.T.Pham@bham.ac.uk,"Ramírez, F.

The proposed model allows an explicit consideration of the interactions among three types of agents in the urban system: (i) the local authority who aims to jointly determine the optimal time for introducing cordon toll pricing scheme, cordon toll location and toll level to maximize social welfare of the urban system; (ii) property developers who seek to determine the intensity of their capital investment in the land market to maximize their own net profit generated from the housing supply; and (iii) households who choose residential locations that maximize their own utility within a budget constraint. The effects of the cordon toll pricing scheme on household's residential location choice and housing market structure in terms of housing price and space are explicitly considered. A comparison of the toll pricing schemes with a fixed and a mobile cordon location over time and the no toll case is carried out. The proposed model is also illustrated in several Chinese cities. Insightful findings are reported on the interactions among cordon toll pricing scheme, urban population size, household income level, toll collection cost, and urban development.

As climate change mitigation and economic concerns drive a sustained transformation of the energy sector, transparent and well-founded analyses are more important than ever. We assert that models and their associated data must be openly available to facilitate higher quality science, greater productivity through less duplicated effort, and a more effective science-policy boundary. There are also valid reasons why data and code are not open: ethical and security concerns, unwanted exposure, additional workload, and institutional or personal inertia. Overall, energy policy research ostensibly lags behind other fields in promoting more open and reproducible science. We take stock of the status quo and propose actionable steps forward for the energy research community to ensure that it can better engage with decision-makers and continues to deliver robust policy advice in a transparent and reproducible way.","[Pfenninger, Stefan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [DeCarolis, Joseph] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hirth, Lion] Neon Neue Energieokonom GmbH Neon, Berlin, Germany; [Quoilin, Sylvain] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, Petten, Netherlands; [Staffell, Iain] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; North Carolina State University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET); Imperial College London,"Pfenninger, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland.",stefan.pfenninger@usys.ethz.ch,"DeCarolis, Joseph F/F-4869-2013; Quoilin, Sylvain/AAE-7477-2019","Quoilin, Sylvain/0000-0002-2064-209X; Hirth, Lion/0000-0002-5563-3310; Pfenninger, Stefan/0000-0002-8420-9498",European Research Council [2012-313553],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),Stefan Pfenninger thanks the European Research Council via grant StG 2012-313553 for funding.,,41,203,219,2,56,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,211,215,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.046,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,"Green Published, hybrid",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800020,0

Using detailed firm-level data, we estimate various specifications based upon repeated cross-sections and means-based pseudo-panels to show that bribes are closely related to poorer electricity reliability. We find that the propensity to bribe for an electricity connection is associated with an increase of 14 power outages per month and a 22% increase in annual sales lost due to power outages on average. The results parallel a tragedy of the commons story: electricity, which exhibits common-pool resource characteristics, suffers from overexploitation as self-interested individual firms rationally bribe for electricity, creating negative impacts in aggregate on the overall quality of the resource. Given the importance of electricity reliability for economic growth and development, the findings imply that improving oversight and enforcement measures at the consumer level that target the reduction of bribery for electricity connections could contribute to growth and development.

This paper deals with an experimental simulation investigation of robust properties of digital control closed-loop systems. Minimization of the Linear Quadratic (LQ) criterion was used for the design of control algorithm. Polynomial approach is based on the structure of the controller with two degrees of freedom (2DOF). Four types of process models (stable, non-minimum phase, unstable and integrating) were used for controller design. The Nyquist plot based characteristics of the open-loop transfer function (gain margin, phase margin and modulus margin) served as robustness indicators. The influence of change of process gain was chosen as a parametric uncertainty. The experimental results demonstrated that a robustness of examined digital control closed-loop systems could be improved by addition of user-defined poles (UDP).","[Bobal, Vladimir; Spacek, L'ubos; Hornak, Peter] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Stranemi 4511, Zlin 76005, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Bobál, V (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Appl Informat, Stranemi 4511, Zlin 76005, Czech Republic.",bobal@fai.utb.cz,"Bobal, Vladimir/H-2119-2012",,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-4-9,,,,2017,,,,,,,348,354,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BH9XI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404420000052,0

We demonstrate the feasibility of our work by a case study in which we improve the torque profiles of a default winch design by means of optimisation. Extending our generic and modular software framework for intelligent product optimisation, the winch calculator can easily be interfaced to external product optimisation clients by means of the HTTP and WebSocket protocols and a standardised JSON data format.

Based on a sample of 2301 innovative firms in Denmark, the study demonstrates that employee-driven relations (measured by employees' and top managers' place of education and scientific discipline) strongly influence the likelihood that firms will collaborate with specific universities.

Under regularity conditions, asymptotic intervals have been shown to be valid under Gaussianity of the innovations. The bootstrap allows us to relax this assumption and to construct valid prediction intervals under more general conditions. Moreover, even under Gaussianity, the bootstrap leads to more accurate intervals in cases where the cross-sectional dimension is relatively small as it reduces the bias of the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator.","[Goncalves, Silvia] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Perron, Benoit] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Perron, Benoit] Univ Montreal, CIRANO, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Djogbenou, Antoine] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Djogbenou, Antoine] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Gonçalves, S (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",sgoncal9@uwo.ca; Benoit.perron@umontreal.ca; antoine.djogbenou@umontreal.ca,"Perron, Benoit/AAH-2316-2021",,NSERC; MITACS; SSHRC,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); MITACS; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors are grateful for comments from Lutz Kilian and seminar participants at the University of California, San Diego, the University of Southern California, Queen's, Pompeu Fabra, the Toulouse School of Economics, Duke, Western, Sherbrooke, and Michigan as well as from participants at the 23rd meeting of the (EC)''2, the 2013 North American Winter Meeting of the Econometric Society, the 2013 meeting of the Canadian Economics Association, the 2013 Joint Statistical Meetings, the conference Bootstrap Methods for Time Series in Copenhagen, the MAESG conference in Atlanta, and the 2014 Canadian Econometric Study Group.

This development requires consistent financial reporting across the world. Reliable and comparable financial data can direct the company in the right direction, especially when deciding to move property to another part of the world. Transparent and consistent financial data can contribute to the stability of the world economy or at least to allow investors and other entities to better assess risks. The Global Accounting Standard would also make it easier for accounting units to enter new markets. In the past, it has been demonstrated several times that different reporting methods can lead to a different interpretation of the status of entities or to complicate the expansion of companies to new markets. It is therefore desirable to unify the accounting systems, in particular the most important ones: IAS / IFRS and US GAAP. This paper deals with issues of international regulation and accounting harmonization. It divides the historical development of the IAS / IFRS and US GAAP accounting systems into stages, shows significant milestones in development, and defines the individual joint projects of the IASB and FASB Councils arising during the convergence process. Based on an analysis of the current state of projects under these accounting systems has been to create an overview of the new standards (revised) and further discusses the possible impact of these changes on corporate financial reporting of the European Union.","[Hinke, Jana; Valtova, Monika] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Hinke, J (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",hinke@kfu.zcu.cz; valtova@students.zcu.cz,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,669,676,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201021,0

We have created a theoretical model for valuing the prepayment option, based on which it can be demonstrated that, depending on the composition of the given bank portfolio (interest rate level, term to maturity), the prepayment option may have a significant effect on the sum of short-term interest income, as well as on the discount value of the bank portfolio via changing cash flows, and through this the value of economic capital.

The possible threats that accompany the migratory process are at the forefront, especially the threat to society's security requirements and the increase in foreigners' crime. For the development of the migration policy of the Czech Republic in modern history, two milestones were crucial. The first was the transformation process of economy, and the second milestone was the entry of the country into the European Union. The increase in the number of foreigners in the country also affected the process of globalization and technical progress, which made the technical and economic barriers to migration diminishing. Today, migratory policy and the shape of international migration in Europe are undergoing changes in the migration crisis. It is related to the global situation in the world. Although the Czech Republic is not one of the countries that would be hit hard by the migration crisis, worries about lower security arise here. The aim of the article is to analyse the criminal behaviour of foreigners in the Czech Republic since joining the European Union, and especially after the outbreak of the crisis.

Intellectual migration is considered in terms of brain drain and brain circulation. The factors influencing the migration processes are studied. Diasporas are regarded as one of the factors influencing the migration flows. At present time, the idea of returning of the brains is replaced by the idea of the effective use of the brains in the host country. In the context of globalizing economy, many researchers say that brain drain is a natural process, but we cannot avoid a number of negative effects caused by it. Thus, the aim for diasporas is to maintain ties between homeland and migrants. Lost profits in this case are the funds invested in education and health. The goal is to find the means which enable the identification of migrants, their location, and to classify them in order to maintain contact with them and be able to use their knowledge for the good of the country. This paper consider project CIDESAL (creation of incubators of intellectual diasporas in Latin America) pursues the objectives indicated above. Effective use of these brains and the identification migrants is very important.

We will discuss trade barriers that SMEs are likely to encounter in export markets. To ensure a greater depth of understanding on SME internationalisation barriers, this paper analyse various approaches to export barriers. Some studies distinguish between internal (associated with limited available organisational resources) or external barriers (which stem from the market environment within which the firm operates). Most of the researchers believe that Central and Eastern European (CEE) enterprises (including Slovak ones) seem to internationalise only in similar countries; the concept of proximity is fundamental in deciding where to expand. In summary, this study examined a number of parameters related to export structures and success of Slovak companies. In particular, the study identified perception of barriers to internationalisation for Slovak companies. This study has used primary data collected through questionnaires from 176 SMEs. Within the external factors, foreign competition showed the highest obstacle for Slovak companies followed by the need to invest in promotional activities and limited access to capital as internal factors. The study summarises the results from the survey of Slovak small and medium-sized enterprises (conducted in 2016) operating in various fields of production and trade. In general, the questionnaire instrument addressed the issues of company characteristics, respondent characteristics, level of international involvement, entry mode and perceptions related to barriers to internationalisation.","[Kormancova, Gabriela] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Kormancová, G (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",gabriela.kormancova@umb.sk,"Kormancova, Gabriela/J-1864-2017","Kormancova, Gabriela/0000-0002-5748-4785",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1030,1035,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201067,0

By method of semi-formalized interviews the expert opinion was received and risks in positioning of social entrepreneurship as producer of social services were identified: differences in non-commercial activities and social entrepreneurship can affect the quality of provision of social services by non-governmental organizations; in motivational orientation of domestic social entrepreneurs the orientation is dominated toward the prospects for generating income in the growing market of social services, rather than creating social value and jobs for target population; blurring of organizational legal status of social entrepreneur and absence of official record of social entrepreneurship; as a consequence of globalization, the contribution of international network development institute to translation and formation of true values of domestic social entrepreneurship is noted.","[Kulkova, V.

It is well established that, at least in recent decades, people with higher levels of education are less likely to smoke and, conditional on being a smoker, are more likely to quit than are people with less education. Using longitudinal data on lifetime smoking histories, I explore whether the educational gradient changes when one accounts for differences in the amount of information smokers have about the health risks associated with smoking. At the core of the analysis is a new way to measure not only the flow of information a person receives but also a person's stock of information in any year. I construct measures of the stock and flow of information with consumer magazine articles that discuss cigarette smoking and health. To calculate exposure, I predict individuals' reading of particular magazines and link predicted exposure to data on individual smoking status in every year of life. The analysis sample includes many individuals who started smoking in the 1930s and 1940s - well before scientific evidence had accumulated. After replicating the education gradient in terms of smoking cessation, I show that it is mostly explained by the interaction between educational attainment and the stock of knowledge individuals possess. The findings suggest that education affects whether and how a stock of health risk information induces people to quit smoking.","[Lillard, Dean R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lillard, Dean R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lillard, DR (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Lillard, DR (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Lillard, Dean R/C-3244-2014",,National Institute on Aging project Cross-national patterns and predictors of life-cycle smoking behavior [1 R01 AG030379-01A2],National Institute on Aging project Cross-national patterns and predictors of life-cycle smoking behavior,"I gratefully acknowledge funding from the National Institute on Aging project Cross-national patterns and predictors of life-cycle smoking behavior (award 1 R01 AG030379-01A2).

Empirical evidence based on Swedish data. Regional Studies. The hypothesis that research activities do not merely affect the growth rate within the municipality hosting the university or university college but spill over to neighbouring municipalities is tested using data covering the Swedish municipalities between 1990 and 2010. Research activities are measured as the number of dissertations and the number of papers published in academic journals with peer-review system. The results suggest academic institutions by their presence and ` production' of human capital and new knowledge through research affect the regional growth pattern in both the municipality where the academic institution is located and the growth pattern of neighbouring municipalities.,"[Lundberg, Johan] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Lundberg, J (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Umea, Sweden.",johan.lundberg@econ.umu.se,,,,,,,36,7,8,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Policy making, decisions about research and development, and stakeholder discourse should be informed by an assessment of future emissions intensity trends, however informed projections are not easily generated. This study investigates expected trends in oil sands GHG emissions using expert elicitation. Thirteen experts participated in a survey, providing quantitative estimates of expected GHG emissions intensity changes and qualitative identifications of drivers. Experts generally agree that emissions intensity reductions are expected at commercially operating projects by 2033, with the greatest reductions expected through the use of technology in the in situ area of oil sands activity (40% mean reduction at multiple projects, averaged across experts). Incremental process changes are expected to contribute less to reducing GHG emissions intensity, however their potentially lower risk and cost may result in larger cumulative reductions. Both technology availability and more stringent GHG mitigation policies are required to realize these emissions intensity reductions. This paper demonstrates a method to increase rigour in emissions forecasting activities and the results can inform policy making, research and development and modelling and forecasting studies.","[McKellar, Jennifer M.] Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Fac Energy Syst & Nucl Sci, 2000 Simcoe St North, Oshawa, ON L1H 7K4, Canada; [Sleep, Sylvia; MacLean, Heather L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada; [Bergerson, Joule A.] Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [MacLean, Heather L.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Toronto, ON, Canada",Ontario Tech University; University of Toronto; University of Calgary; University of Toronto,"McKellar, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Fac Energy Syst & Nucl Sci, 2000 Simcoe St North, Oshawa, ON L1H 7K4, Canada.",jennifer.mckellar@uoit.ca,"Sleep, Sylvia/D-5667-2019","Sleep, Sylvia/0000-0001-7036-9039",Carbon Management Canada [D1]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [238312],Carbon Management Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This work was supported by: Carbon Management Canada (Project D1) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant No. 238312),,31,10,13,0,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JAN,2017,100.0,,,,,,162,169,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.014,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EH6SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391903900016,0

Consumer perceptions of certification, and in particular brand awareness itself, play the most important role in this respect. The main monitored parameter is consumer behaviour in case of knowledge, respectively failure to recognize certification marks and the potential to a pay price premium for the added value of products.

Such ES can be provisioning, regulating and cultural ES, around which competition over land resources will increase with energy system shifts. Much of this can be foreseen to take place within urbanising regions that are simultaneously the living environment of a major part of the human population today. In order to inform critical urban policy decisions, tools for integrated assessment of urban energy and transport options and ecosystem services need to be developed. For this purpose, a case study of the Stockholm region was conducted, analysing three scenarios for the future urbanisation of the region, integrating a transport energy perspective and an ES perspective. The results showed that a dense but polycentric development pattern gives more opportunities for sustainable urban development, while the dense monocentric scenario has apparent drawbacks from an ES perspective. The methodology is compatible with a model integration platform for urban policy support and will thus enable integrated policy assessment of complex urban systems, with the goal of increasing their sustainability.

Therefore, by analyzing the present situation of Apple's marketing in Aksu, the author puts forward two marketing models suitable for Aksu's development and the countermeasures to reconstruct the two models, and hopes to build up the modern apple marketing model of Aksu region.","[Peng, Xuemei] Tarim Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xinjiang 843300, Aksu, Peoples R China",Tarim University,"Peng, XM (通讯作者)，Tarim Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xinjiang 843300, Aksu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-452-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,179.0,,,,,,94,97,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6MO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854700019,0

Revenue from contracts with customers - IFRS 15 (for European/ global companies, approved by the IASB), and ASC 606, of the US GAAP (elaborated by the FASB in the USA) will be effective since 2018. New standards jointly worked out, are very demanding and requiring judgement in many situations, but it should reduce the revenue manipulation in the financial statements worldwide.

Their effective use, both in the micro and macro scale is one of major challenges in 21st century. The extent to which the available supply of labour is utilised is an important economic and social issue. The unemployment rate is well known measure of labour underutilisation, but it may give a falsely optimistic picture of the labour market and the economy. It is because two important groups of people are excluded from official unemployment statistics - underemployed and marginally attached to the labour force. Underemployment may take different forms (e.g. underutilization of skills, underutilization of labour). However, only underutilization of labour, which occurs when workers are willing and able to supply their labour full-time, but work in part-time jobs as they could not find full-time employment, can be measured. It is often called a visible underemployment and this form of underemployment is the subject of the paper. The questions that naturally arise from these considerations apply to the scale of underemployment and the socio-economic consequences of this phenomenon. The main research questions are: what is the scale and dynamics of underemployment in the European Union?, how big are disparities across UE?, is there a relationship between underemployment and characteristics of the labour force (e.g. age)? Considering the aforementioned conditions, the goal of the paper is to present diversity of underemployment in EU-28 between 2008 and 2016.","[Skorska, Anna; Balcerowicz-Szkutnik, Maria] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Balcerowicz-Szkutnik, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Labour Market Res & Forecasting, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",anna.skorska@ue.katowice.pl; maria.balcerowicz-szkutnik@ue.katowice.pl,"Skórska, Anna/S-4599-2018",,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2401,2408,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204040,0

The globalisation processes taking place in the last few years have had an impact on uncontrolled advancement of many negative phenomena occurring in the economy, as well as in daily existence of residents of many African countries. Africa is extremely diversified both politically and, what is the most negative, ethnically (paradoxically not on the grounds of religion). The continent is currently going through aftereffects of international dependency on great economies, which has not been experienced since Africa freed itself from the colonial domination in mid 20th century. It mostly happens due to countries internal policy and external influence caused by the urge to control exploitable resources. Moreover, spiritual factors and the influence of variety of religions on social and mental awareness of Africans, are a threat to the sustainable, abuse-free growth. Appearance of economic activities and attempts of bursting into cultural areas of Africa's inhabitants may be either negative or lead to innovative changes aligned with the western meaning of that term. An attempt of answering a matter of those significant threats is based on an objective assessment of the importance of those processes on African countries and their ability of finding themselves in the new reality of the ethnically, culturally and economically conflicted world. In that case it is beneficial to use statistical data referring to the changes in some indicators specific for African countries that occur over time. It is also essential to take into consideration the wealth of the country, its industrial structure, the development of agricultural production, urbanisation, education along with road and rail infrastructure.","[Szkutnik, Wlodzimierz] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat Math Method Econ, 1 Maja 50 Str, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Szkutnik, Weronika] Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Fac Law & Adm, Golebia Str 24, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; Jagiellonian University,"Szkutnik, W (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ Krakow, Fac Law & Adm, Golebia Str 24, PL-31007 Krakow, Poland.",wlodzimierz.szkutnik@ue.katowice.pl; weronika.szkutnik@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2618,2625,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205002,0

At present, studies on M&As primarily focus on performance, influential factors, and integration problems. By contrast, this study begins with the perspective of the announcement effect. In this study, we find negative linkages between cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) and short selling amount around M&A announcement dates. Short selling plays a pivotal role in downward price pressure for stock-financed mergers. Further, we find opposite price pressure surrounding merger closings, particularly for the constituent stocks of the Shanghai Composite Index.

So far, a number of authors have identified the shortcomings of such bankruptcy models. Models thus do not assume any significant events, which the company may come across, nor do they assume any irrational management decisions. Significant situations may be solved by a company three-level judgement (bankruptcy model, we will adjust it using causal methods). However, not always are we able to project every situation individually into the future result. That is why we will use an intuitive method, projecting the remaining tens, hundreds or thousands of factors influencing the future company development. Nevertheless, irrational decisions of stakeholders are impossible for us to predict. Despite that, creating company clusters according to the compliance of individual descriptive characteristics may become a step towards a method capable of such action. The aim of this contribution is carrying out a cluster analysis of companies operating in manufacturing industry and identification of companies, which have completed their activity, without being pushed by their economic results. Cluster analysis will be carried out with the help of Kohonen networks, i.e. neural structures without a teacher.

The Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP) in Sri Lanka was an exemplary renewable energy access program, successfully installing 21,000 off-grid SHSs alongside grid-connected mini-hydro capacity and off-grid village hydroelectric systems. It reached all of its targets ahead of schedule and below cost. By contrast, the Indonesia Solar Home System Project (ISHSP), which ran from 1997 to 2003, sought to reach one million rural Indonesians through the sales and installation of 200,000 SHSs. However, by project closing in 2003, less than five percent of the original sales target, or only 8054 units, had been installed. The ESDP and ISHSP were the World Bank's first foray into a market-based renewable energy services provision model. Based on original research interviews and field observation, the article finds that contrasting the two programs one a success, the other a failure offers lessons for energy and development practitioners, namely that effective programs are those that select appropriate technology, often with input from households themselves; they promote community participation and ownership; and they have robust marketing, demonstration, and promotion activities.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Sussex; Aarhus University,"Sovacool, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",National University of Singapore [09-273]; John D. and Catherine T.

However, beyond anecdotal evidence, we do not know why some M&A deals in the electricity and gas industries are abandoned. We analyze a sample of over 5000 M&As in the electricity and gas industries. The three most important factors affecting M&A abandonment are if the acquirer engaged in a divestiture at the same time, whether the target firm was publicly owned, and if the acquirer already had a toe-hold (part ownership) in the target firm at the time of the M&A deal. An M&A deal is 10.17% less likely to be abandoned if the acquirer engaged in a divestiture at the same time. An M&A involving a publicly owned target firm is 9.87% more likely to be abandoned. Lastly, an M&A in which the acquirer had a toe-hold in the target company is 7.87% more likely to be abandoned. Our findings show that policy makers and practitioners should be aware that the M&A process is affected by often over-looked deal or firm specific factors.","[ten Brug, Hans; Sahib, Padma Rao] Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Sahib, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, Fac Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",p.rao.sahib@rug.nl,,,,,,,35,8,8,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,230,239,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.042,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700023,0

Spatial econometric techniques are used to identify location patterns, pinpoint territorial activity clusters and to measure agglomeration economies.","[Boal, Ivan; Cesar Herrero, Luis] Univ Valladolid, Fac Comercio, Dept Econ Aplicada, Plaza Campus Univ 1, Valladolid 47001, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Boal, I (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Fac Comercio, Dept Econ Aplicada, Plaza Campus Univ 1, Valladolid 47001, Spain.",ivan.boal@uva.es; herrero@emp.uva.es,"MIGUEL, IVÁN BOAL-SAN/AAZ-8236-2021; Herrero-Prieto, Luis César/K-9465-2014","MIGUEL, IVÁN BOAL-SAN/0000-0001-9921-0945; Herrero-Prieto, Luis César/0000-0002-2915-5706",,,,,54,12,12,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

For comparative reasons we also use the duration of civil disputes as a further indicator of institutional quality used in the regressions as an alternative to the indicator of regulatory complexity. From the theoretical point of view, we use the approach of negative co-ordination externalities, among the four sources of regulatory production that are at work at the same time. Our approach may be applied in all the countries with a multi-level government system. Using the random effects and quantile regressions models we are able to quantify the effects of an improvement in institutional quality on the GDP and the growth rate, making a comparison between the results obtained using regulatory complexity or the duration of civil disputes as covariates. We also check for spatial dependence among variables. Econometric analysis supports the theoretical assumption that regulatory complexity is an impediment to the growth of regional GDP and per capita income. The main finding of our analysis is that a reduction in regulatory complexity would be more effective than a reduction in the duration of civil disputes in increasing the income and growth rate. This result could be useful for the policy-maker because by reducing regulatory complexity we may obtain a considerable by-product in the shorter duration of civil disputes.","[Di Vita, Giuseppe] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Palazzo Sci Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Di Vita, G (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Palazzo Sci Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",gdivita@lex.unict.it,"Di+Vita, Giuseppe/AAD-9924-2020","Di Vita, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1916-1544",,,,,93,14,14,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The paper has two major aims. The first is to develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the income return to entrepreneurship by combining the Lazear model with the assumption that the skill profiles in a population are Frechet-distributed. The second is to demonstrate that the resulting theoretical derivations can be used for a new type of regional analysis of the income return to entrepreneurship and wage employment. The empirical analysis is based on data for individuals with a Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. We compute their income return to self-employment and wage employment in three parts of Sweden: the Stockholm region, the combined Gothenburg and Malmo region, and the Rest of Sweden. The results show that the average return to self-employment is less than 5% in all regions and smaller in the Gothenburg and Malmo region than in the other two regions. The regional differences are explained by the differential supply curves and market values of entrepreneurial talent. The theoretical derivation of the income return to entrepreneurship is the main contribution of the paper. Another contribution is the derivation of regional supply curves for entrepreneurs.","[Harsman, Bjoern] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mattsson, Lars-Goran] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hovsepyan, Vardan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology; Royal Institute of Technology,"Hårsman, B (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",bjorn.harsman@indek.kth.se; lgm@kth.se; vardan.hovsepyan@indek.kth.se,"Mattsson, Lars-Goran/G-9512-2013","Mattsson, Lars-Goran/0000-0001-9507-9185",,,,,23,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

National policy measures may have international spillover effects which partly neutralize domestic emission reduction, while different types of policy measures may offset each other as well. This paper explores the conditions for these interaction effects by using a concise partial-equilibrium two-country model of the electricity market which also includes a system for emissions trading. We find that the international spillover effects not only depend on the integration of electricity markets, but also on the tightness of the emissions-trading system. We show that this tightness is negatively related to the degree the supply of renewable energy is stimulated. We find that the more renewable energy is stimulated, the less domestic reduction in carbon emissions is offset by spillover effects. A more binding cap in the emissions-trading system makes national policies less effective. Hence, if climate-policy measures such as subsidies for renewable energy make the cap in the trading scheme less binding, these climate-policy measures become more effective. (C) 2018 The Authors.

This paper analyzes how the GDP per capita affects the transport energy consumption, testing possible non-linear relationships between variables. A transport energy consumption function depending on GDP and its squared and cubed value is estimated for 22 LAC countries, over the period 1990-2014. The results support an N-shaped curve, while the elasticity values of transport energy consumption, with respect to GDP per capita, do not show a tendency to decrease in the long term. Fourteen LAC countries show absolute coupling levels at the end of the period, while the rest exhibit partial couplings. Likewise, trade openness, population density, degree of urbanization and structural changes in the economy have positive effects on the transport energy consumption. This paper proposes some energy efficiency measures to control the growing energy use, and the promotion of biofuels and electric vehicles is also considered necessary to reduce the negative effects of transport energy use.","[Rehermann, F.; Pablo-Romero, M.] Univ Seville, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Polit Econ, Seville 41018, Spain; [Pablo-Romero, M.] Univ Autonoma Chile, Providencia, Chile",University of Sevilla; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Pablo-Romero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Polit Econ, Seville 41018, Spain.",mpablorom@us.es,"Pablo-Romero, Maria del P./D-8391-2013","Pablo-Romero, Maria del P./0000-0001-9546-0840","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-56399-R]; Chile's Ministry of Education project, FONDECYT [1150025]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Chile's Ministry of Education project, FONDECYT","The second author acknowledges the financial support received from the ECO2014-56399-R Project of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the funding received from Chile's Ministry of Education project, FONDECYT Regular 1150025.",,74,40,44,0,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,518,527,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.006,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700048,0

However, its effects on energy intensity have received little attention. Given the importance of reducing energy intensity, this study advances the understanding of the relationship between intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity by taking advantage of a rich dataset of 40 economies derived from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), spanning across 13 years (1995-2007). A relatively robust causal relationship between intangible capital and sectoral energy intensity has been identified. The qualitative and quantitative interactions of this relationship with income level and sectoral heterogeneity have also been revealed. It is found that the effect of intangible capital on reducing sectoral energy intensity generally diminishes along with increasing income level but a moderate quadratic relationship is identified in some types of intangible capital. Finally, sectors where intangible capital have the largest and smallest effect are also pinpointed.","[Yang, Shenglang] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng] Univ Technol Sydney, Australia China Relat Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Shi, Xunpeng] Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Low Carbon Econ, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xunpeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore 119620, Singapore",Australian National University; University of Technology Sydney; Hubei University of Economics; Hubei University of Economics; National University of Singapore,"Yang, SL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",shenglang.yang@gmail.com; xunpeng.shi@gmail.com,"Xunpeng, Roc Shi/I-5486-2019","Xunpeng, Roc Shi/0000-0001-9653-7395",,,,,44,25,25,0,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,118,128,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.027,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700011,0

Using the difference-in-differences method with establishment fixed effects, we find that firms reduce the number of employees and increase average annual earnings from longer working hours in response to an exogenous increase in labour costs without productivity gains. Firms manage to pay for this increase in the average wage paid to the remaining workers by reducing the number of employees to keep total payroll costs unchanged. In contrast, since social insurance premiums are shared equally between employees and employers, firms pay the remaining half premiums that they are imposed with. Sub-sample analyses show that firms adhering to a labour hoarding policy did fire many workers taking advantage of the 2003 reform. This may indicate that the reform provided a good excuse to cut employment in firms that had been forced to comply with a labour hoarding policy even in an over-employment situation, which is more likely in sectors and countries where dismissals are rigorously regulated.","[Kodama, Naomi; Yokoyama, Izumi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Kodama, Naomi] METI, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor,1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Kodama, N (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.;Kodama, N (通讯作者)，METI, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor,1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",kodama.naomi@r.hit-u.ac.jp; izumi.yokoyama@r.hit-u.ac.jp,"Kodama, Naomi/HNB-9949-2023; Yokoyama, Izumi/T-8665-2017","Yokoyama, Izumi/0000-0003-4661-2670","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K13369, 16H03630, 15K20998] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,45,4,5,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the array of federal, ISO/RTO and state-level rules and regulations shaping today's energy storage deployment across the United States. We highlight the fragmented and heterogeneous nature of existing market participation models available for advanced energy storage across restructured power markets and emphasize the need for design changes to power markets at all timescales to allow for the more efficient integration of energy storage. We also reflect on how well FERC's recent Order 841 does in terms of providing a framework for the establishment of more fit-for-purpose market participation models for storage, something that will be key for today's evolving power sector as it becomes more dependent on intermittent renewable resources.","[Sakti, Apurba; O'Sullivan, Francis] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Botterud, Audun] MIT, Lab Informat & Decis Syst, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Botterud, Audun] Argonne Natl Lab, Energy Syst Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Sakti, A (通讯作者)，MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sakti@mit.edu,"O'Sullivan, Francis M/H-3739-2011",,,,,,43,33,43,4,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,569,579,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.001,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300053,0

Since 2008, the number of forest-based bioenergy plants increased rapidly, following the introduction of the wood-chips scheme and the high local expectations of its benefits for rural development. Obstacles to its continuous sustainable development have subsequently been increasing. Therefore, the goal of the study is to investigate the causal processes of bioenergy development to understand what threatens its triple bottom line sustainability. The study does so by employing qualitative system dynamics (i.e. causal loop diagram) and using interviews with local actors to elaborate on studies that look at the influence of power, institutions and expectations on the transition processes. Results show that the local actors' positive perceptions of the benefits of bioenergy mainly drove its initial development, but that conflicting local interests, power relations, and market dynamics now threaten these initially positive perceptions.","[Cavicchi, Bianca] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Storgata 2-4-6, N-0030 Oslo, Norway; [Cavicchi, Bianca] Univ Oslo, TIK, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture, Eilert Sundt Bldg,5th Floor Moltke Moes Vei 31, N-0851 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; University of Oslo,"Cavicchi, B (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Storgata 2-4-6, N-0030 Oslo, Norway.",bianca.cavicchi@nibio.no,,,Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,"I would like to thank the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, and particularly my research group Grounded Innovation for funding this PhD project.

The cumulative installed capacity of LE in 2015 was almost four times of that in 2002. Moreover, China has a target of 20% for non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by 2030. LE provides substantial carbon savings in the use phase, but LE infrastructure tends to require more materials than their fossil-fuel electricity counterpart. Here we estimate the carbon 'overhead' from infrastructure expansion during China's transition to LE. We report estimates of the learning curves of the carbon intensity of LE installation, calculated from regional historical data in the period 2002-2012. We combine this information with the predicted cumulative installed capacity from well-known scenarios from national and international bodies. We then project the trends of carbon impacts from LE investments up to 2040. Our results show that, under all scenarios and every year, the annual carbon impact of LE investments never exceeds 4% of China's total carbon emissions, and that the carbon impacts of the expansion in LE infrastructure show either a steady decline or a peak during 2030-2035 before declining further.","[Yuan, Rong; Behrens, Paul; Tukker, Arnold; Rodrigues, Joao F.

Based on data available in national and international reports, three scenarios for the power supply sector expansion were modelled in OSeMOSYS. The Brazilian perspective of power integration considers funding strategic hydro projects in Argentina, Bolivia, Guyana and Peru. An alternative to the power integration process considers higher penetration of distributed photovoltaics and biogas power plants as well as lower hydro capacity expansion in Brazil. Features related to costs, carbon emissions, hydro reservoirs, technological performance, electricity demand, population growth, time zones and reserve margin were considered. The comparison of different scenarios provides insights regarding the contribution of renewable energy generation and sheds light on cross-border trade perspectives between Brazil and other countries in South America. Using a cooperative games approach, the bargaining power of each country (player) was calculated by applying the Shapley value concept. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Guyana have the largest bargaining power, either as exporter or importer.","[Pinto de Moura, Gustavo Nikolaus; Loureiro Legey, Luiz Fernando] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Planejamento Energet, Ctr Tecnol, Ilhado Fundao, Bloco C,Sala 211,Cidade Univ, BR-21949972 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Howells, Mark] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Sch Ind Engn & Management, Unit Energy Syst Anal, Brinellvagen 68, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Royal Institute of Technology,"de Moura, GNP (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Planejamento Energet, Ctr Tecnol, Ilhado Fundao, Bloco C,Sala 211,Cidade Univ, BR-21949972 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",gustavonikolaus@ppe.ufrj.br; legey@ppe.ufrj.br; mark.howells@energy.kth.se,,"Howells, Mark/0000-0001-6419-4957","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior from Brazilian Ministry of Education; Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil; division of Energy Systems Analysis at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior from Brazilian Ministry of Education; Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil; division of Energy Systems Analysis at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden","This research is indebted to various individuals and organizations.

Based on province level panel data for years of 1991-2014, it indicates that there exists the energy stacking process of rural household energy transition, characterized by the significant consumption inertia effects of traditional biomass energy (TBE), traditional commercial energy (TCE) and advanced commercial energy (ACE), respectively, the insignificant substitution effect of TCE and ACE for TBE, and the significant partial substitution of ACE for TCE. With regard to the factors underlying rural household energy transition: 1) per capita disposal income is negatively correlated with TBE, TCE and ACE consumption; 2) the number of motorcycles is positively correlated with TCE and ACE consumption; 3) the number of firewood-saving stoves and the price for ACE are positively correlated with TBE consumption; 4) household size and the number of motorcycles and the number of appliances are positively correlated with ACE consumption; 5) education level is positively correlated with TBE, but negatively with TCE consumption; 6) the number of rural energy management institutions is positively correlated with TBE, but negatively correlated ACE consumption; Therefore, some policy implications are discussed.","[Han, Hongyun; Wu, Shu] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhijian] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Han, HY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",Hongyunhan@zju.edu.cn,"Wu, Shu/AHC-4120-2022; Wu, Shu/JJC-3895-2023; zhang, zhi/HPH-4905-2023","Wu, Shu/0000-0002-7865-6988; zhang, zhi jian/0000-0001-5549-1546",Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA070]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This research was supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 14ZDA070) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.,,95,82,87,17,123,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2018,114.0,,,,,,234,244,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.052,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FW0DY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424962800023,0

This paper examines the extent to which China's power sector reforms will assist RE integration, and issues to effective implementation. It demonstrates that a well-established electricity market could provide practical solutions to RE integration challenge. China's existing power sector regime heavily regulated by administrative planning constrains RE integration. The on-going electricity reforms (new reforms) in the country such as the transmission and distribution (T&D) tariff reform, the direct trading of electricity, among others, along with new RE policies such as full purchase of guaranteed RE generation and green certificate system, should assist RE integration in the country. However, there are a number of implementation challenges such as the intervention from local governments in direct electricity trades and the lack of a quota system for RE, among others. If these challenges are not properly addressed, the potential positive impacts of the new reforms on RE integration will be undermined. It is recommended that the central government strengthen top-level design and supervision, design and build up electricity spot markets, push forward the regional electricity markets, and facilitate the establishment of a renewable quota system.","[Zhang, Sufang; Li, Sitao] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sufang] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Zhang, Sufang] Res Base Beijing Energy Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Andrews-Speed, Philip] Natl Univ Singapore, Energy Studies Inst, Singapore, Singapore",North China Electric Power University; University of Sussex; National University of Singapore,"Zhang, SF (通讯作者)，2 Beinong Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zsf69826313@sina.com,"Andrews-Speed, Philip/W-9578-2019; Andrews-Speed, Philip/Q-5692-2019","Andrews-Speed, Philip/0000-0003-1639-2021;",National Social Science Foundation of China [14BJY063],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 14BJY063).

The combination of electricity prices and Feed in Tariff schemes can either act as an enabler or a barrier to the economics of battery investment. At the moment, the investment in used batteries makes sense mostly in Germany but countries such as UK and Italy or Spain could be future candidates.

To increase efficiency in the energy market, Mexican authorities approved a constitutional amendment aiming to open the state-run energy markets to competition in 2013. The reform is expected to raise efficiency and to lower energy prices in the long run. However, it will take some time for the new institutional arrangements to settle and the reform objectives to materialize. The removal of subsidies, which is expected to take place after the reform, will also raise prices particularly in the short run. In this paper, we analyze the effect of likely energy price changes due to energy market reform on household consumption and welfare in different income groups. We estimate the QUAIDS model using the nonlinear SURE method and the Mexican household budget surveys for the period 2002-2012 to obtain elasticities. The results show great heterogeneity in elasticities across energy types and income groups. Specifically, energy demand is elastic with respect to income, but changes in prices have mixed effects among energy types. The welfare effect of the price changes on low-income households will be 9 times stronger than that on the mid-income households and 18 times on and the high-income households. This warrants a compensation package to make the reform socially acceptable.","[Moshiri, Saeed] Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Santillan, Miguel Alfonso Martinez] CBRE, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Moshiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",smoshiri@stmcollege.ca; Miguel.Martinez2@cbre.com,,,,,,,51,36,39,1,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,663,672,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.035,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500062,0

We used our own original methodology combining the statistical procedures of fuzzy clustering and expert survey data. We considered indicators characterizing the reproduction potential and variables characterizing the potential quality of the future population. As a result of fuzzy clustering, five clusters were formed. Our experts evaluated the reproduction potential and the quality of the future population for each cluster. The data for each region were used to calculate their reproduction potential and the quality of their future population. In comparison to hard clustering, fuzzy clustering enhances the flexibility of evaluation: our assesments of each region do not depend exclusively on the potential of the nearest cluster, as we also take into consideration the region's possible similarities with other neighbouring clusters with different potential. Such modelling allows us to identify those Russian regions that could be considered as `growth points' in the implementation of demographic policy.","[Bagirova, Anna; Shubat, Oksana; Akishev, Alexander] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Bagirova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru; o.m.shubat@urfu.ru; alexander.akishev@urfu.me,"Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013; Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013","Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144; Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093",Russian Federation [NSh-3429.2018.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Fertility and parenting in Russian regions: models, invigoration strategies, forecasts, supported by the President of Russian Federation, project no.

It results not just in increasing the importance of the financial sector in relation to real sector, but as well as in transferring the income from the real economy to the financial sector, contributing to the growth of income inequality and stagnant wages. This paper deals with the question concerning global aspects of financialization and its aim is twofold: (i) overviewing recent contributions in this field to define financialization, briefly narrate its genesis emphasizing on problems caused by financialization and (ii) to analyse globalization aspect of financialization over the last half of the century at country level examining whether and at what extent this aspect of globalization is spread out across different regions and income groups and how it is linked with long-run growth.","[Butkus, Mindaugas; Morkiene, Agne] Siauliai Univ, P Visinskio Str 25, LT-76351 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Siauliai University,"Morkiene, A (通讯作者)，Siauliai Univ, P Visinskio Str 25, LT-76351 Shiauliai, Lithuania.",mindaugobutkaus@gmail.com; agnesmorkienes@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1494,1501,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300191,0

Innovation capacities are driven within the company by various aspects, such as management approach, knowledge, creativity or leadership. External factors, different innovation policies of countries, market forces, environmental changes or technological capability, play also an indisputable role. The source of innovation usually lies on the interface between the firm and its environment. Large firms are the main leaders in the innovation process based on the latest data. Specialised departments, which focus mainly on innovation, can be found in majority of them. Large firms have the advantage of various skills and specialised knowledge obtained due to their wide range of activities and human capital. The possibility of progress in employee career when their proposal is accepted or diversity of impulses to innovate gained by operation in globalized environment can have positive impact. On the other hand, large firms are not very flexible compared to small and medium- sized firms, but they have superior financial resources to invest as a result of their size.

Optimization of the energy consumed in cloud data centers and computing servers is usually related to the scheduling problems. It is very difficult to define an optimal scheduling policy without negoative influence into the system performance and task completion time. In this work, we define a general cloud scheduling model based on a Stackelberg game with the workload scheduler and energy-efficiency agent as the main players. In this game, the aim of the scheduler is the minimization of the makespan of the workload, which is achieved by the employ of a genetic scheduling algorithm that maps the workload tasks into the computational nodes. The energy-efficiency agent selects the energy-optimization techniques based on the idea of switchin-off of the idle machines, in response to the scheduler decisions. The efficiency of the proposed model has been tested using a SCORE cloud simmulator. Obtained results show that the proposed model performs better than static energy-optimization strategies, achieving a fair balance between low energy consumption and short queue times and makespan.","[Fernandez-Cerero, Damian; Fernandez-Montes, Alejandro] Univ Seville, Dept Comp Languages & Syst, Av Reina Mercedes S-N, Seville 41012, Spain; [Jakobik, Agnieszka] Cracow Univ Technol, Warszawska St 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland; [Kolodziej, Joanna] Res & Acad Comp Network, Kolska St 12, PL-01045 Warsaw, Poland",University of Sevilla; Cracow University of Technology; Research & Academic Computer Network (NASK),"Fernández-Cerero, D (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Comp Languages & Syst, Av Reina Mercedes S-N, Seville 41012, Spain.",damiancerero@us.es; afdez@us.es; agneskrok@gmail.com; joanna.kolodziej68@gmail.com,"Fernández-Cerero, Damián/L-5279-2018; Jakóbik, Agnieszka Krok/R-3435-2018; Fernández-Montes, Alejandro/E-6988-2010","Fernández-Cerero, Damián/0000-0002-9403-111X; Fernández-Montes, Alejandro/0000-0002-2998-4950",COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) [IC1406]; VPPI - University of Sevilla,COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); VPPI - University of Sevilla,"This article is based upon work from COST Action IC1406 \High-Performance Modelling and Simulation for Big Data Applications(cHiPSet), supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) and by the VPPI -University of Sevilla.",,24,7,7,0,0,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,460,467,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000068,0

We construct test statistics for the hypothesis that Z is exogenous, that is, that U is independent of Z. The test statistics are based on the observation that Z is exogenous if and only if V = F-Y|Z(Y|Z) is independent of W, and hence they do not require the estimation of the function phi. The asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are proved, and a bootstrap approximation of the critical values of the tests is shown to be consistent and to work for finite samples via simulations. An empirical example using the U.K. Family Expenditure Survey is also given.

Globalisation brings more possibilities of international tax planning therefore the importance of tax havens has increased even rapidly. Although they are called tax havens, the tax legislation is not the most important indicator of better taxation conditions. Multinationals can reach lower effective tax rate by separate agreement with governments therefore it is important to analyse also other indicators. This contribution focuses on the European Union and tax havens, which are member countries of this organization. Data used as variables within selected method address disproportion of some economic indicators in tax havens. As a method, cluster analysis was selected because it is able to separate the group of tax havens. Results show that there is significant difference between EU countries. Five EU countries are identified as tax havens: Luxembourg, Ireland, Netherlands, Malta and Cyprus.

The goal is to perform statistical inference on the homophily parameters while treating the node-specific parameters as fixed effects. Jointly estimating all parameters leads to incidental-parameter bias and incorrect inference. As an alternative, we develop an approach based on a sufficient statistic that separates inference on the homophily parameters from estimation of the fixed effects. The estimator is easy to compute and can be applied to both dense and sparse networks, and is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties under sequences of growing networks. We illustrate the improvements of this estimator over maximum likelihood and bias-corrected estimation in a series of numerical experiments. The technique is applied to explain the import and export patterns in a dense network of countries and to estimate a more sparse advice network among attorneys in a corporate law firm.","[Jochmans, Koen] Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Jochmans, K (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",koen.jochmans@sciencespo.fr,,,European Research Council [715787]; European Research Council (ERC) [715787] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author is grateful to the joint editor, an associate editor, and two referees for constructive comments.

Our study is focused on seven factors of transformational leadership which were researched within the sample of 50 Czech companies CEO's. The aim of the study is to identify the managerial characteristics and behaviour in relation to the subordinates. The research method is based on Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-6S). The research results show that there is much more significant factor than the length of managerial practice, management level or number of subordinates. This factor represents the gender of the leader. Male and female managers significantly differ in the measure of perceived trust and respect by their subordinates. As well, the differences could be found in the way they understand the needs of their subordinates and the way they develop their potential.

Our research seeks to examine the effect of size, work position of respondent, share of the foreign capital in the ownership structure of the organization and the economy sector the organization operates in on the implementation of diversity management. An empirical survey was carried out that examined the state of the implementation of diversity management in the Slovak Republic. Using parametric statistical methods (ANOVA, linear regression) as well as its non-parametric alternatives (Kruskal-Wallis test), the research survey revealed that the evaluated factors significantly influenced the attitudes of respondents towards the diversity management implementation. The respondents working in large business organizations generally perceive the diversity management concept more positively when compared with respondents working in smaller organizations. The respondents working in business organizations where the share of foreign capital in the ownership structure exceeds 80% are more positively inclined towards the implementation of diversity management. The mangers and team leaders do perceive the DM more positively when compared to respondents who are not managing a team. We recommend domestic business organizations and SMEs to focus on the diversity issues, especially on supporting the diversified work teams. This can preferably be done by diversity training, using formalized HRM procedures and mentoring initiatives. Diversity management is not solely a domain of subsidiaries and large business organizations. The organizations are able to benefit from diversity management regardless of their size and country of origin.","[Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan; Kozakova, Jana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lancaric, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",lancaric.drahoslav@gmail.com; radovan.savov@uniag.sk; jana.kozakova@uniag.sk,"Kozáková, Jana/AAC-7916-2020","Kozáková, Jana/0000-0001-7913-9053",[VEGA 1/0543/17],,Prispevok je vystupom projektu VEGA 1/0543/17 -Integrated talent management model and its impact on economic results of enterprises podporenym MSVVaS SR.,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,243,250,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300032,0

Under these conditions, managers of traditional enterprises try to conduct modernization in order to maintain competitiveness. To do this, they invite specialists with higher education in hope that they will manage independently to introduce technical innovations into the traditional technological process. In such a way quite often they temporarily achieve the desired economical result, including money saved on personnel development. However, failures in the work of new technology, which cannot be eliminated by specialists who have not passed through necessary training program, often lead to risks of uncompensated loss of efficiency. Nevertheless, this approach has become widespread despite the managerial full understanding of its palliative. Further development of the organization cannot be carried out without the introduction of technical innovations. This fact, in its turn, requires changes in the development strategy of the organization labour potential.

The extreme interpretation of this process is often referred to expert literature as an advanced capitalism that worships local traditions and regional differences and creates a homogenized world culture. Globalization is inseparably linked to the creation of a business environment, which is only paid attention in Slovakia since the creation of the market economy in the context of the change of social establishment in 1989. Family and family business represent two intermingling and mutually affecting worlds. In each of them, there are values and principles that make up the family and form a business. Family businesses should help the stability and economic independence of families and increase the attractiveness of the business environment. Creating a favourable business environment with particular emphasis on family business is generally the most powerful engine of any economy with multiple benefits. Additionally, the right marketing application helps to promote this business. The business process as well as the family business are much more developed in Western countries, helped by a favourable political situation, but also for centuries of ongoing and evolving entrepreneurship. The aim of the paper is to examine selected aspects of family business in selected countries, with particular emphasis on current conditions in the Slovak Republic in the context of globalization. The issue of family business is generally in the field of family law and commercial law. However, the research is a multidisciplinary issue with significant transitions to economics, management and marketing.","[Mucha, Boris; Brestovanska, Patricia; Peracek, Tomas; Strazovska, Lubomira] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Mucha, B (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",boris.mucha@fm.uniba.sk; patricia.brestovanska@fm.uniba.sk; tomas.peracek@fm.uniba.sk; lubomira.strazovska@fm.uniba.sk,"Strazovska, Lubomira/AAH-1664-2019; Mucha, Boris/GLN-5431-2022; Peráček, Tomáš/P-1829-2019","Strazovska, Lubomira/0000-0002-7631-1193; Peráček, Tomáš/0000-0002-3498-5640",,,,,18,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2668,2675,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300341,0

During the last decades several studies have shown that functional surface structures provide the potential to reduce the viscous drag in the turbulent boundary layer and thus increase efficiency. Due to the rather challenging manufacturing process of micro-scale riblets most studies were conducted using constant riblet dimensions causing losses of the possible drag reduction. With the rapid development in micro structuring technologies it is now possible to manufacture continuously adapted riblets in almost industrial processing scales. For the design of continuously adapted riblets an algorithm is developed considering the effect of a deviation of the riblet spacing from its theoretical optimal value in order to maximize the cumulative drag reduction additionally effected by a misalignment of the riblet structure. The algorithm is applied for the design of riblets with a trapezoid cross-section for the NREL wind turbine airfoil 5809 at a Reynolds number of Re = 2 . 10(6). The shear stress data required to determine an appropriated region for the riblet application and optimal riblet dimensions are provided by 2D numerical studies using an empirical three equation transition model which shows good consistency of the predicted location of the transition onset with experimental results. With the outlined design approach an increased drag reduction in rage of 25.7% compared to riblets with constant dimensions can be expected.,"[Oehlert, Karsten; Haake, Jan H.; Hartung, Konrad M.] Jade Univ Appl Sci, Inst Energy & Proc Engn, D-26389 Wilhelmshaven, Germany",Jade University of Applied Sciences,"Oehlert, K (通讯作者)，Jade Univ Appl Sci, Inst Energy & Proc Engn, D-26389 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",karsten.oehlert@jade-hs.de; Jan.Haake@student.jade-hs.de; konrad.hartung@jade-hs.de,,,German Federal Minister of Education and Research,German Federal Minister of Education and Research,This work has been conducted within the cooperative research project entitled Fluidmechanical Optimization of Turbomachinery by High-rate Laser Structuring Technologies (OstrALas) funded and supported by the German Federal Minister of Education and Research.,,27,0,0,0,2,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,366,372,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000054,0

Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a wide range of scenarios, we find that the conventional cluster-robust Wald test can severely over-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels. The proposed methods are implemented in an R package called clubSandwich.

Based on individual farm data over the period 1994-2014 we analyse inputs and outputs of agricultural production. The decrease in employment in agriculture is a result of technological progress, changes in individual family preferences and low income in comparison to other sectors of economy. In the production, commodities with low labour input dominate. Cereals, oilseeds and industrial crops dominate. Large farms benefit in form of economy of scale and agricultural output of farms remains low in Slovakia. There are large farms in Slovakia, which are very dynamic in replacing the labour with capital and using economy of scale. The overall level of production per hectare is low and one of the reasons is the size structure and the subsequent distribution of Common agricultural policy (CAP) subsidies. Only a small share of beneficiaries receives the dominant share of direct payments from the first pillar of the CAP. We evaluate the impact of capping of direct payments in terms of the nature of the farms that would be affected in the Slovak Republic as well as the redistributive effects of capping. Results show that if capping direct payment is applied in the Slovakia under CAP 2021-2027 the policy will divide farms into a group of less active farms and a group of more active farms. Higher employment per 100 hectares in uncapped farms and significantly lower employment in capped farms will not create excessive pressure on further employment cuts.","[Toth, Marian; Rabek, Tomas; Holubek, Ivan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",marian.toth@uniag.sk; tomas.rabek@uniag.sk; ivan.holubek@uniag.sk,"Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019",,VEGA [1/0666/17]; Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-16-0321]; KEGA [041SPU-4/2017],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); KEGA,"This paper was supported by the project VEGA no. 1/0666/17 with the title Impact of Integration and Globalization on Business Risk in Slovak Agriculture, by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-16-0321 and KEGA no. 041SPU-4/2017 with the title,Financial management a business risk in Slovak agriculture.",,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,924,931,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300120,0

A lot of local producers, as well as small and medium-sized businesses that do not have the capital needed to sustain global trends, face a lot of pressure on competition. If an enterprise wants to become a global business and gain the benefits of a global market, it must first increase its competitive ability. Businesses should focus primarily on the possibility of increasing the efficiency of their production processes. Business processes consist of core business, which is the main reason for the existence of the entire business, and supporting activities, which help the company in the performance of its core business. There is often an accumulation of ineffectively spent funds in supporting activities. That is why support activities offer the most space to optimize business costs. This area is dedicated to facility management. Facility management is one of the most modern ways of conducting business support activities. Helps businesses focus on their core businesses by taking over the management of all supporting activities.","[Vagner, Ladislav] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Vagner, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",ladislav.vagner@fpedas.uniza.sk,,,VEGA [1/0870/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project of VEGA No 1/0870/16 Application of facility management in managing the transport companies in the Slovak Republic.,,27,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,932,937,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300121,0

In this article, we deal with logistics systems in the conditions of globalization. The logistics system includes all enterprise logistics chains created for each individual products or customers (supply, production, distribution and business articles are subsystems), works with logistic resources (goods, people, information) that optimally deploys, focusing on customer needs, and pursues the main goal and partial goals of enterprise logistics. In logistics systems, the use of methods, approaches and management procedures is increasingly being promoted to optimize all activities. The essence is to satisfy the needs of customers at the lowest cost and acceptable quality. With the development of modern logistics, a number of logistics technologies are gradually being developed and evolving around the world. Each company creates its own logistics enterprise systems, concepts looking for its own way. The aim of the article is to define the concept of logistic system, to describe its individual subsystems within the concept of logistics, to define the difference between macro-logistic and micro-logistic systems.","[Vidrova, Zdenka; Ceniga, Pavel] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Vidrova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",zdenka.vidrova@fpedas.uniza.sk; pavel.ceniga@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Ceniga, Pavel/P-3333-2015",,,,,,27,0,0,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2377,2384,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300304,0

The results suggest that there are ownership-specific endowments like the company size, market orientation. The location-specific endowments of the markets played an important role. The probability to innovate depended positively on the technological level of industry. The MNEs were consistently stressing throughout the whole period the existence of a variety of hampering factors of innovation. MNEs competing in national and world markets are more likely to spend more money on R&D activities than firms competing in European and small local markets. The European markets are home markets for most of the MNEs located in the Czech economy and it is a default market for them. The lack of credit and other external sources was an issue for MNEs because of the lower incomes from sales in times of economic crisis of 2008.","[Vokoun, Marek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Humanities, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vokoun, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Dept Humanities, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",marek.vokoun@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vokoun, Marek/AAI-3302-2020","Vokoun, Marek/0000-0001-5659-3085","Internal Grant Agency at the Institute of Technology and Business in Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic [2018/8110/004]","Internal Grant Agency at the Institute of Technology and Business in Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","This paper is an output of the scientific work of Internal Grant Agency at the Institute of Technology and Business in Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic, 2018/8110/004, grant name: Rizeni inovaci v globalnim kontextu.",,24,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2385,2391,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300305,0

The findings suggest that latecomer cities such as Dezhou demonstrate several advantages over developed cities in environmental transitions. In particular they can leapfrog' to environmentally friendly technologies as they are less locked in by existing technological regimes.

However, because the federal government's borrowing rate is lower than that of private entities, the energy projects could be performed at a lower cost than at present. Despite potential savings to the government of well over (sic)100 million dollars per year, this does not occur. This note provides some reasons. One involves interpretation of existing legislation. Given the present legal interpretation, Congress would need to change the law to enable government agencies to finance energy projects through a federal entity, such as the Federal Finance Bank. However, the note points out that Agencies have little incentive to push for such a change, and that Congress itself seems inclined to enable more, not less, private financing of agency projects. Thus, it seems unlikely that the potential savings from government financing of federal energy projects will occur.","[Canes, Michael E.] Logist Management Inst, Mclean, VA 22102 USA",,"Canes, ME (通讯作者)，Logist Management Inst, Mclean, VA 22102 USA.",mcanes@lmi.org,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,28,31,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.020,0.0,,,4,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700004,0

Data on volumes of flared gas (FG) and those of gasoline and diesel from 2001 to 2015 sourced from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation were used in this study. Empirical formulas and relevant emission factors were utilized in estimating various parameters involving GHGs and costs as related to the fuels (CNG, gasoline and diesel). Business as usual (BAU) and SFSI scenarios was examined with baseline year as 2015. Energy equivalence of the total volume of gasoline and diesel distributed in the baseline year was 25.2% of FG. Under the BAU scenario, 2.67 x 10(7) t, 1.33 x 10(7) t, 229.5 t and 6.01 x 10(7) t of CO2, CH4, N2O and GHGs were emitted at fuel cost of $2.05 billion. With SFSI, CO2, CH4, N2O, GHGs and cost were reduced from 2.5% to 32%, 2.2-74.6%, 5.7-72.3%, 2.4-55.6% and 41.3-80.5%, respectively, compared to BAU scenario. The implementation of SFSI appears a sustainable means of reducing FG, national GHGs, and associated environmental and health footprints in Nigeria.","[Giwa, Solomon O.; Nwaokocha, Collins N.] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Agr & Mech Engn, Coll Engn & Environm Studies, Ibogun Campus, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Odufuwa, Bashir O.] Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Coll Engn & Environm Studies, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria",,"Giwa, SO (通讯作者)，Olabisi Onabanjo Univ, Dept Agr & Mech Engn, Coll Engn & Environm Studies, Ibogun Campus, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria.",sologiwa2002@yahoo.com,"Giwa, Solomon/I-3066-2019; Nwaokocha, Collins/I-2068-2019","Giwa, Solomon/0000-0001-6331-2288; Nwaokocha, Collins/0000-0002-3566-8567; Bashir Olufemi, Odufuwa/0000-0003-1876-073X",,,,,42,8,8,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,193,203,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.027,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700021,0

We show that the response of real gross value added growth is negative and often statistically significant for net energy importers, while for net energy exporters it is not distinguishable from zero. This result holds for the aggregate economies, as well as for the selected industries. Moreover, the effects of oil supply shocks increase with the degree of energy dependence in the Mediterranean countries belonging to the European Union. Our results have several policy implications. First, the European Union should encourage projects on the efficient use of energy in the Mediterranean area.

Significant legal scholarship offers alternative models of `smart,' responsive' environmental regulation, emphasising the need for policy instrument mixes, including the vital role of voluntary, industry-led sustainability standards. Yet, as is being increasingly recognised, these contributions leave open the need for detailed, qualitative evaluation of instrument mixes as a complement to primarily quantitative cost benefit analyses that predominate in regulatory impact assessments by governments. Addressing this need, this paper evaluates policy and standards for low and zero carbon homes in England during the Coalition government (2010-2015) when the ecological modernisation discourse of the previous New Labour government became subsumed by a deregulation agenda. Our study, incorporating 70 stakeholder interviews, suggests that, in supplier-driven markets such as housing in England, a 'smart' mix of mandatory and voluntary standards requires a strong, central role for government in setting national, mandatory standards and supporting their delivery. There is an important potential supplementary role for voluntary tools and local authority discretion, though our study highlights problems that can arise when such different instruments promote diverging road maps towards a policy goal.","[Greenwood, Dan; King, Martin] Univ Westminster, London, England; [Congreve, Alina] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Westminster; University of Hertfordshire,"Greenwood, D (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 32-38 Wells St, London W1T 3UW, England.",D.Greenwood2@westminster.ac.uk,"Greenwood, Daniel/IQU-4321-2023","Congreve, Alina/0000-0002-1666-0105",Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Research Trust [479],Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Research Trust,This research received funding from Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (RICS) (Grant ref. 479) Research Trust.

The kingdom has managed to maintain a constant share of global crude oil markets, even as it copes with growing domestic demand for oil and a spate of investments in refineries, inside and outside the kingdom. Longer term, the threat of peak global oil demand - perhaps in response to climate change - enhances the attractions of a shorter time horizon to depletion. However, an increase in Saudi crude oil production would have consequences for markets and competing forms of energy, as well as for the kingdom's geopolitical stature.

One option to lower these emissions significantly is using the manure to produce biogas which is used to generate power. Our model calculations show, that per kWh power from manure-based biogas-about 1.448 kg of CO2 eq. of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission can be avoided due to the improved manure management and the substitution of electricity from the grid under actual German conditions. This form of utilization is supported under the German Renewable Energy Act; however, only the minor share of the manure is processed so far. Thus the question arises as to whether instruments in agricultural policy or instruments in energy policy are better to unlock this remaining potential. The elaborated allocation shows, that both sectors cause a comparable amount of GHG emissions reductions, at around 50% each. However, based on expected developments, the relevance of agriculture-related emissions is slated to increase. This leads to the conclusion that implementing instruments in both agricultural and energy policies would make sense.","[Oehmichen, Katja; Thraen, Daniela] Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum gGmbH DBFZ, Leipzig, Germany; [Thraen, Daniela] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Oehmichen, K (通讯作者)，Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum gGmbH DBFZ, Leipzig, Germany.",katja.oehmichen@dbfz.de,"Thran, Daniela/E-7672-2015","Thran, Daniela/0000-0002-6573-6401",funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),The project is supported (was supported) by funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany.,,29,21,21,5,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,471,477,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.014,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800046,0

We disentangle production and consumption spillovers by separating out human capital employed in a city's labour market and human capital present in a city's resident population, respectively. We do so for both the recent graduates flowing into Dutch cities to find work and a residential location, as well as for the incumbent workers and population. We control for the effects of a city's skills endowments, its (non-) economic characteristics and those of other relevant cities. We find positive effects of a relatively strong graduate labour market inflow on the share of higher and scientific-level jobs. Production spillovers therefore predominantly occur among the higher skilled. Contrary to the higher educated incumbent population, which appears to prefer high skilled services, recent graduate inflows to residential areas have positive effects on the share of jobs requiring lower and medium skills. Consumption spillovers from graduate residential inflows thus occur between higher and lower skilled.","[Venhorst, Viktor A.] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Venhorst, VA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",v.a.venhorst@rug.nl,,"Venhorst, Viktor/0000-0002-8138-2105",,,,,49,2,3,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Hot topics involve direct and indirect land use change and the ability of agroenergy to foster or hinder food and energy security. Worldwide research has dealt with these and other issues associated with the sustainability of the diffusion of agroenergy generation systems, but the subject is still open. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the sustainability of agroenergy. We propose an empirical model to simulate the diffusion of farm biogas installations and estimate a set of indicators covering the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability at the regional level. Model results show that the current incentive mechanism does not allow to meet EU's energy targets at the local level. To do so, the policy mix needs an improved design accounting for regional peculiarities across the EU. Model results show that agroenergy production can help farmers stabilise their income and keep viable rural areas, despite some trade-offs among socioeconomic and environmental indicators. Major drawbacks are environmental risks associated with farming intensification.","[Bartolini, Fabio; Gava, Oriana; Brunori, Gianluca] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Bartolini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",fabio.bartolini@unipi.it; oriana.gava@for.unipi.it; gialuca.brunori@unipi.it,"brunori, Gianluca/E-1687-2014; Bartolini, Fabio/C-5232-2011","brunori, Gianluca/0000-0003-2905-9738; Bartolini, Fabio/0000-0002-8946-3110; Gava, Oriana/0000-0001-7930-9251",,,,,72,23,24,1,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,510,519,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.039,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400049,0

Our contingent valuation survey conducted in 2016 of 1460 households yields dichotomous choice data based on the respondents' answers to a series of closed ended questions. Such data are less susceptible to the strategic bias that often plagues self-stated WIT data obtained by direct elicitation via open-ended questions. Using binary choice models, we find that average WTP is 48-51%, relative to current bills, if the decarbonization target is achieved via natural gas generation and renewable energy. However, estimated WTP declines to 32-42% when decarbonization entails additional nuclear imports from China. As the projected bill increase caused by the target's implementation is 40%, our WTP estimates support the government's fuel mix policy of using natural gas and renewable energy to displace Hong Kong's coal generation.","[Cheng, Y.

To reconcile the results with existing studies, I illustrate how ignoring precautionary motives increases the estimated importance of children.

In this analysis, we illustratively explore combining,the reform of the fuel prices used in power plants with the implementation of alternative electricity pricing schemes for the households. Compared to the scenario replicating the year 2015, we find: The aggregate gain to the energy system could reach nearly $12 billion per year by raising both electricity prices to households and industrial fuels to reflect the cost of supply or international markets. Households would pay an additional $3 billion in electricity costs without any mitigation for the low-income households. However, Lifeline prices would halve this burden, while maintaining greater gains than deregulating fuel prices alone. The average electricity price paid under the lifeline scenario would be a more manageable 4.0 cents/kWh, versus an average marginal-cost price of 7.1 cents/kWh. In the alternative electricity pricing scenarios we study, natural gas usage by the power utilities falls, allowing gas to flow to other industries, which would consume it to reduce their costs. We find the marginal values of natural gas falling at higher electricity prices, indicating that the supply of gas is becoming less constraining.","[Matar, Walid] KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia; [Anwer, Murad] SEC, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia",,"Matar, W (通讯作者)，KAPSARC, POB 88550, Riyadh 11672, Saudi Arabia.",walid.matar@kapsarc.org; MAnwer@se.com.sa,,"Matar, Walid/0000-0003-4459-347X",,,,,20,26,28,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,747,756,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.060,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400072,0

New vehicles acquired need to be distinctly superior to the old vehicles scrapped, in terms of their energy efficiency and/or carbon intensity. To keep track of the process of vehicle fleet renewal and assess its time scale and potential for energy conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation, stock-flow modeling is a useful tool. The bottom-up stock-flow cohort model ensures coherence between the stock in any given year and the annual flows of scrapping, deregistration, new vehicle acquisitions, and second-hand vehicle import and export. It can be constructed from a few years' segmented data on the vehicle stocks and their annual mileage. As evidenced by our stock-flow model for Norwegian registered vehicles, it may take 5-25 years, in some cases even longer, before innovations affecting the flow of new vehicles have penetrated similarly into the stock. This energy transition time lag would tend to increase with the speed of innovation and with the target level of penetration, but decrease with the velocity of vehicle turnover.","[Fridstrom, Lasse] Inst Transport Econ TOI, Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Fridstrom, L (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ TOI, Oslo, Norway.",,,"Fridstrom, Lasse/0000-0001-9205-7992",Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; Norwegian Automobile Association (NAF); Institute of Transport Economics (TOI),Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; Norwegian Automobile Association (NAF); Institute of Transport Economics (TOI),"The research underlying this study was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the Norwegian Automobile Association (NAF).

The purpose of this normative paper is to address the following question: are there conditions under which partial property rights are economically efficient in a renewable resource economy? To address this question, we treat the level of completeness of property rights as a continuous variable in a renewable resource economy. By design, property rights restrict access to the resource, so they may allow a limited number of firms to exercise market power. We show that there exists a level of property rights completeness that leads to first-best resource exploitation; this level is different from either absent or complete property rights. Complete rights are neither necessary nor sufficient for efficiency in the presence of market power. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal level of property rights completeness and discuss its policy relevance and information requirements. The optimal level depends on (i) the number of firms, (ii) the elasticity of input productivity, and (iii) the price elasticity of market demand. We also find that a greater difference between the respective values of input and output requires stronger property rights. In fact, high profits imply both a severe potential commons problem and may be the expression of market power; strong property rights limit the commons problem; and their incompleteness offsets market power. Biology also impacts the optimal quality of property rights: when the stock of a resource is more sensitive to harvesting efforts, optimal property rights need to be more complete.

In China, SDR programs are instrumental in peak shaving, renewables integration, emissions reduction and grid reliability improvement. Previous literature has not captured the effects of the latest development of electricity market reform on SDR. Our work is distinguished from prior work by (a) comprehensively identifying China-specific SDR challenges, by contrasting these with international experience, (b) identifying effective drivers to overcome new market challenges, and (a) recommending policies and providing insights into China's future SDR development. Our paper identifies three major challenges for SDR development and adoption in China, namely, financial and market, consumer, and infrastructural challenges. In parallel, we identify drivers to overcome these challenges, including electricity market reform, introduction of new market entrants, and development of decentralized electricity systems. Finally, we put forth China-specific policy recommendations, including, continuous market reform, performance-based regulations for national utilities, a level playing field for new market entrants, and investments on consumer-based technologies.

As a case study, we examine a policy for biogas technology adoption in rural China, and implement a large in-person farm-household survey. We find that farmers with a higher level of openness to experience are more likely to adopt the biogas technology. In contrast, farmers with a lower level of confidence in influencing outcomes they experience are less likely to adopt the biogas technology. In addition, we find that openness seems to affect adoption through the perceived ease of use of the technology. Our findings indicate that including personality traits into adoption models of renewable energy technologies can give us a better understanding of individual differences in the adoption decision, and highlight the importance of energy policies that aim to improve the perception of the ease of use of these technologies.","[He, Pan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, West Ctr Econ Res, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Veronesi, Marcella] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Verona, Italy; [Veronesi, Marcella] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Dev & Cooperat NADEL, Zurich, Switzerland",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Verona; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Veronesi, M (通讯作者)，Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",hepan@swufe.edu.cn; marcella.veronesi@univr.it,"Veronesi, Marcella/JAX-3674-2023","Veronesi, Marcella/0000-0001-5520-8093",China Scholarship Council (NSCIS) [2010]; North-South Centre of ETH Zurich [2-71445-11]; Southwestern University of Finance and Economics [330310001002020007],China Scholarship Council (NSCIS); North-South Centre of ETH Zurich; Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,"We acknowledge the financial support of the China Scholarship Council (NSCIS No. 2010), the North-South Centre of ETH Zurich (No. 2-71445-11), and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (No. 330310001002020007).

The foundation of energy justice draws heavily from the environmental justice movement, grounded in larger issues of representation, economic relations between the state, firms and social groups. This article draws from the environmental justice movement to explore concepts of universal and particular justice. Universal energy justice holds to values stemming from judicial and philosophical groundings based in procedural, distributional and cosmopolitan justice issues. Particular energy justice relies on recognition justice of cultural and environmental factors influencing choices around energy technologies and policy preferences for the distribution of energy services. Empirically, this article examines tensions within the energy system in the European Union. It does this in two areas: First, by examining how universal energy justice is spread through National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) dealing with energy; Second, particular energy justice is exemplified by a political solution to energy poverty in Bulgaria, rather than a regulatory response, this contrasts with a Western European approach. The aim of the article is to show the pursuit of energy justice attempts to resolve tensions between groups and differing politics to both access and provide energy services.","[LaBelle, Michael Carnegie] Cent European Univ, CEU Business Sch, Budapest, Hungary; [LaBelle, Michael Carnegie] Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University; Central European University,"LaBelle, MC (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, CEU Business Sch, Budapest, Hungary.;LaBelle, MC (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Budapest, Hungary.",labellem@ceu.edu,,"LaBelle, Michael Carnegie/0000-0002-5013-1186",,,,,41,66,71,4,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2017,107.0,,,,,,615,620,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.054,0.0,,,6,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FA0WU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405158200060,0

The innovation performance is decomposed into the regional economic structure effect, R&D intensity effect, innovation efficiency effect, and economic development effect according to the driving mechanism. The results indicate that the third effect in this list, innovation efficiency, contributes the most to innovation performance at 54.28%, followed by the regional R&D intensity at 27.49%, and China's economic development at 19.92%. The effect of the regional economic structure is negative, at -1.69%.

As most policy affecting fracking occurs at the state-level, it is important to understand how citizens' support for the technology is shaped by their states' industrial, environmental, and socioeconomic experiences. Using a nationally representative survey, we construct a multilevel model to understand how individuals' support for fracking varies as a function of both individual- and state-level characteristics. At the state-level, we find that people residing in states with a higher poverty rate and higher ground water use for public drinking supply are more likely to support fracking. At the individual level, the relationships between risk/benefit perceptions and support vary as a function of the state people live in. Additionally, the positive relationship between conservatism and support for fracking is stronger for people residing in states with a higher poverty rate. Based on these findings, we discuss the dynamics of public opinion in social contexts and implications on energy policymaking.","[Howell, Emily L.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, 122 Sci Hall,550 North Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Li, Nan] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr Educ & Commun, Box 42131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Akin, Heather; Brossard, Dominique] Univ Penn, Annenberg Publ Policy Ctr, 202 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Scheufele, Dietram A.; Xenos, Michael A.; Brossard, Dominique] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Life Sci Commun, Hiram Smith Hall,1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Scheufele, Dietram A.; Brossard, Dominique] Morgridge Inst Res, 330 N Orchard St, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Xenos, Michael A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Commun Arts, 821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; The Morgridge Institute for Research, Inc.; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Howell, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Life Sci Commun, Hiram Smith Hall,1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",elhowell@wisc.edu,"Howell, Emily/JFS-2580-2023; Scheufele, Dietram A./A-8737-2008; Li, Nan/F-8553-2011; Li, Nan/AAA-8373-2022","Scheufele, Dietram A./0000-0002-9914-5407; Li, Nan/0000-0001-5942-552X; Xenos, Michael/0000-0002-2604-172X",National Science Foundation [SES-0937591],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by grants from the National Science Foundation to the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University (Grant No. SES-0937591).

We address the question of whether China's wind industry has become an important source of clean energy technology innovation. We find that in terms of wind capacity expansion, China has delivered enormous progress, increasing its wind capacity from virtually no wind capacity in the early 2000s to 140 GW by 2015. However, in terms of innovation and cost competitiveness, the outcomes were more limited: Chinese wind turbine manufacturers have secured few international patents and achieved moderate learning rates compared to the global industry's historical learning rate. Leading China-based indigenous producers are likely to remain important global players for the foreseeable future, but further progress in reducing the cost of capital equipment may slow relative to the recent past. However, opportunities in lowering curtailment rates and improving turbine quality can reduce China's overall levelized cost of electricity for wind.","[Lam, Long T.; Azevedo, Ines M.

One example is the Swedish-Norwegian tradable green certificate scheme. We examine whether design features in the Norwegian part of this scheme, specifically, the scheme's short duration and the way it is to be abruptly terminated, contribute to investors' perceptions of barriers. We apply econometric techniques on primary data collected in two surveys of Norwegian investors in hydropower, and we use real options theory to predict and interpret investors' responses. We show that: (1) immediately after the scheme was introduced, investors are eager to lock in future subsidies by investing immediately and concerned with factors that may delay the completion of their projects; (2) as the certificate deadline neared, investors have become increasingly pessimistic and concerned with economic and risk barriers. Investors in big hydropower plants with regulation reservoirs are particularly concerned with the risk of not completing their projects in time to gain the right to sell certificates. These findings are consistent with the predicted responses to the scheme design derived from real options theory. In contrast to earlier studies, we find no difference in responses to the scheme design across investor types.","[Linnerud, Kristin] CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Simonsen, Morten] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, N-6851 Sogndal, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Linnerud, K (通讯作者)，CICERO Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway.",kristin.linnerud@cicero.oslo.no; morten.simonsen@hvl.no,,"Linnerud, Kristin/0000-0001-9558-5141","Research Council of Norway [238281/F60, 228811/E20]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway [grant numbers 238281/F60, 228811/E20].",,33,23,26,2,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2017,106.0,,,,,,560,578,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.012,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW2RL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402343600053,0

The main market drivers and barriers for WHP market expansion in Southeast Asia are also analyzed. Given the fact that WHP is a far cheaper power generation technology as compared with traditional and renewable power generation, the WHP market is expected to increase fast in the coming years. Mounting electricity price from grid, government emissions regulations and subsidies, the integration of WHP products with original equipment manufacturer, capital cost reduction induced by technology development are identified as the key drivers for the market growth.

After discovering the lack of thermodynamic integration into stock modelling, this paper presents the development of an exergy-based building stock model. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to investigate the impact of large-scale future energy retrofit scenarios in the English and Welsh (E&W) non-domestic sector, and secondly, to determine the potential of exergy analysis in improving sectoral efficiency and its potential implications on exergy-oriented policy making. The research explores seven different large-scale future retrofit scenarios that encompass typical, low-carbon, and low-exergy approaches. Modelling results show that by 2050, current regulations have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 49.0 +/- 2.9% and increasing sector thermodynamic efficiency from 10.7% to 13.7%. On the other hand, a low-exergy oriented scenario based on renewable electricity and heat pumps is able to reduce carbon emissions by 88.2 +/- 2.4%, achieving a sectoral exergy efficiency of 19.8%. This modelling framework can provide energy policy makers with new insights on policy options based on exergy indicators and the assessment of their potential impact.","[Garcia Kerdan, Ivan; Ruyssevelt, Paul] UCL, Energy Inst, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Raslan, Rokia] UCL, Environm Design & Engn, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Garcia Kerdan, Ivan; Morillon Galvez, David] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Dept Mecan & Energia, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Garcia Kerdan, Ivan] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Roderic Hill Bldg,South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Imperial College London,"Kerdan, IG (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Roderic Hill Bldg,South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",i.kerdan.12@ucl.ac.uk,"Raslan, Rokia/HDN-9245-2022; García Kerdan, Iván/F-3495-2019","García Kerdan, Iván/0000-0002-0566-555X; Raslan, Rokia/0000-0003-3157-4843","Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT) [CVU: 331698, 217593]; EPSRC [EP/K011839/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011839/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The first author acknowledges support from The Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT) through a scholarship to pursue doctoral studies with a CVU: 331698 and grant number: 217593.,,70,8,9,3,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,467,483,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.020,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900045,0

However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers' attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers' behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions.","[Bhati, Abhishek; Hansen, Michael; Chan, Ching Man] James Cook Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",James Cook University,"Bhati, A (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.",Abhishek.bhati@jcu.edu.au; michaelmotet.lansen@my.jcu.edu.au; chingman.chan@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bhati, Abhishek/P-9715-2015; Hansen, Michael Motet/AAK-9506-2021; Bhati, Abhishek/AAK-2754-2021","Bhati, Abhishek/0000-0001-5890-8394; Hansen, Michael Motet/0000-0001-7645-5958;",,,,,33,101,107,6,94,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,230,239,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.032,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500023,0

The following national contextual variables are tested: geographical distance, nuclear energy production status, freedom of the press, and the building of new nuclear reactors. The results illustrate that previous research has misunderstood the moderating role of national context on opinion change after the Fukushima accident. A survey conducted shortly after the accident with more than 23,000 respondents from 41 countries has shown that geographical distance from the accident mattered: Contradicting a previous study, the decrease in support for nuclear energy was stronger in countries closer to Fukushima. In addition, support for nuclear energy decreased more in countries where new nuclear reactors were under construction. The country's nuclear energy production status and press freedom did not determine opinion change after the Fukushima accident. The non-effect of freedom of the press on opinion change contradicts the role of media after a focusing event as described in the literature. Overall results demonstrate a limited effect of national context on opinion change following a focusing event. Hence, national context provides only limited information to policy makers on how to respond to a nuclear accident.","[Latre, Edwin; Perko, Tanja] CEN SCK, Belgian Nucl Res Ctr, Expert Grp Soc & Policy Support, 200 Boeretang, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Latre, Edwin; Perko, Tanja; Thijssen, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Media Movements & Polit, 2 Sint Jacobstr, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK CEN); University of Antwerp,"Latré, E (通讯作者)，CEN SCK, Belgian Nucl Res Ctr, Expert Grp Soc & Policy Support, 200 Boeretang, B-2400 Mol, Belgium.",edwin.latre@uantwerpen.be; tanja.perko@sckcen.be; peter.thijssen@uantwerpen.be,"; Thijssen, Peter/S-2410-2016","perko, tanja/0000-0001-8405-6631; Thijssen, Peter/0000-0002-1202-8452",R & D collaboration agreement between SCK-CEN [17]; R & D collaboration agreement between GDF-SUEZ [64],R & D collaboration agreement between SCK-CEN; R & D collaboration agreement between GDF-SUEZ,"The authors thank Dr. Younghwan Kim, Dr. Minki Kim and Dr. Wonjoon Kim for providing them with the country level data used in their study.

This observation flies in the face of pro-leave narratives that posited that the major beneficiaries of European Union membership were the metropolitan elites' of London.

We uncover evidence of threshold effects in children's outcomes based on parental education and cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as their interaction with offspring characteristics. We interpret these thresholds as organizing dynastic earning processes into status traps. Status traps, unlike poverty traps, are not absorbing states. Rather, they reduce the impact of favorable shocks for disadvantaged children and so inhibit upward mobility in ways not captured by linear models. Our evidence of status traps is based on three complementary datasets; that is, the PSID, the NLSY, and US administrative data at the commuting zone level, which together suggest that the threshold-like mobility behavior we observe in the data is robust for a range of outcomes and contexts.","[Durlauf, Steven N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kourtellos, Andros] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Tan, Chih Ming] Univ North Dakota, Dept Econ, 293 Centennial Dr,Stop 8369, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Cyprus; University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Durlauf, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sdurlauf@ssc.wisc.edu; chihming.tan@business.und.edu,"DURLAUF, Steven/H-4965-2016","KOURTELLOS, ANDROS/0000-0001-9662-0420",Vilas Trust; Institute for the New Economic Thinking; University of Cyprus; Greg and Cindy Page Faculty Distribution Fund,Vilas Trust; Institute for the New Economic Thinking; University of Cyprus; Greg and Cindy Page Faculty Distribution Fund,Durlauf thanks the Vilas Trust and Institute for the New Economic Thinking for financial support.

This paper analyses social safeguard norms in Chinese-led dam projects in Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, hotspots of Chinese-led dam construction. We find that social safeguard norms adopted have significantly changed in the past 15 years. While Chinese dam developers claimed to adopt standards of the host countries upon the launch of China's Going Out Policy in 2001, with occasional adoption of more demanding Chinese standards, they did not adopt international norms. In recent years, however, they increasingly take into account international norms. We argue that the root cause for this change is social mobilization, with the suspension of the Myitsone Dam in 2011 as a particular game changer. Enhanced social safeguard legislation in host countries and China, stricter rules of Chinese funders and cooperation of Chinese dam developers with international players have also facilitated this change.","[Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kirchherr, Julian; Charles, Katrina J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Matthews, Nathanial] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Walton, Matthew J.] Univ Oxford, St Antonys Coll, Oxford, England",Utrecht University; University of Oxford; University of London; King's College London; University of Oxford,"Kirchherr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Charles, Katrina J/D-1948-2009; Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019","Walton, Matthew/0000-0001-5882-8837","Friedrich Naumann Foundation; Programme on Modern Burmese Studies at St Antony's College, University of Oxford","Friedrich Naumann Foundation; Programme on Modern Burmese Studies at St Antony's College, University of Oxford","This research was funded by Friedrich Naumann Foundation and the Programme on Modern Burmese Studies at St Antony's College, University of Oxford.

This approach evaluates long-term plans using the cost of delivered electricity, resource mix, jobs and economic stimulus created within communities, and decentralized generation mix of the system, with results provided in a spatially-resolved format. This approach complements existing electricity planning methods (e.g., Integrated Resource Planning) by offering novel evaluation criteria based on typical stakeholder preferences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with a case study based on a blank-slate scenario, which begins without generation or transmission infrastructure, for the long-term rural renewable energy plans of Liberia, West Africa. We consider five electrification strategies: prioritizing larger populations, deploying large resources, creating jobs, providing economic stimulus, and step-wise cost minimization. Through the case study we demonstrate how this approach can be used to engage stakeholders, supplement more established energy planning tools, and illustrate the effects of stakeholder decisions and preferences on the performance of the system.","[Alfaro, Jose F.; Miller, Shelie; Johnson, Jeremiah X.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Sustainable Syst, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Riolo, Rick R.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Alfaro, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ctr Sustainable Syst, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jfalfaro@umich.edu,"Johnson, Jeremiah/F-3505-2013; Alfaro, Jose F/D-8137-2018","Alfaro, Jose F/0000-0002-7127-8240; Johnson, Jeremiah/0000-0002-9602-4976","National Science Foundation through Graduate Research Fellowship Program; University of Michigan's Rackham Graduate School, Center for Sustainable Systems, and African Studies Center","National Science Foundation through Graduate Research Fellowship Program; University of Michigan's Rackham Graduate School, Center for Sustainable Systems, and African Studies Center","Funding was generously provided by the National Science Foundation through its Graduate Research Fellowship Program, and by the University of Michigan's Rackham Graduate School, Center for Sustainable Systems, and African Studies Center.

In this context, the uneven path experienced by two major Latin American NOCs - Petrobras and Pemex - is striking. Our work seeks to explain the uneven performance, focusing on the productive aspects. In particular, we analyze the oil fiscal regimes in Brazil and Mexico as a very crucial aspect - though not the only one - within oil-rich countries that may shed light on the disparities between Petrobras and Pemex. The contribution of our work to the existing literature derives from the relationship that we establish between the characteristics of the respective oil fiscal regimes and the productive performance of the two NOCs, with special consideration paid to the ways in which a fiscal regime contributes, or not, to promoting and guiding the investment efforts of companies. We compare investment, production, and reserve indicators of Pemex and Petrobras and conclude that the Mexican and Brazilian oil fiscal regimes can largely explain the productive and investor performance of both NOCs.","[Ramirez-Cendrero, Juan M.; Paz, Maria J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Ramírez-Cendrero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",jmramire@ucm.es; mjpazant@ucm.es,"Ramírez-Cendrero, Juan M./AAS-1788-2021; Paz, Maria J./I-8829-2017","Ramírez-Cendrero, Juan M./0000-0002-0417-5030; Paz, Maria J./0000-0002-4892-8006",,,,,34,11,16,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,473,483,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.009,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800047,0

Although socio-cultural challenges of energy transition have been recognised (Field, 2015; IPCC, 2011; Teske et al., 2015), understandings about socio-geographic places of energy transition and their underlying social processes and structures are insufficiently studied and often remain underestimated. To close this gap, we theoretically and empirically analysed the multifaceted interplay between place, local entrepreneurship and 'community renewable energy'. Our study is based on an analysis of regional documents and policy reports, and on qualitative interviews undertaken with inhabitants in the case-study municipality of Reussenktige (Germany). Our findings reveal two important aspects: Firstly, people's individual and shared place meanings which materialised in social, physical, historical and climate-related place-attachments and meanings of contested and innovative place are important ingredients bearing an impact on processes of adopting or rejecting renewables. Secondly, differentiated characteristics of entrepreneurs, namely grounded, collaborative, innovative, change-making, economic, communicating, networking and political aspects, appeared to be relevant for the acceptance and support in community-based renewable energy projects. Our findings reveal that energy policies, funding schemes and administrative structures should recognise local socio-geographic important elements in the context of a sustained and decentralised energy transition.","[Suesser, Diana; Doering, Martin; Ratter, Beate M.

In this framework, a modal share model based on a random coefficient logit model and an activity-based method are used to analyze the contribution of an incentive policy to the potential MS and corresponding CO2 emission mitigation. Stated preference survey, face-to-face interviews, and group discussions are employed to obtain the essential data. Case study result shows that a CO2 emission mitigation of 2,586.88 t may be achieved with a subsidy of 200 RMB/TEU (Renminb/20-feet equivalent unit) to the shippers who choose the road-rail combined transport chain in Yiwu City. Compared with the business-as-usual scenario without subsidy, the subsidy policy scenario can achieve a 3.2% MS from a road-only transport chain to a road rail combined transport chain, as well as a 2.07% CO2 emission mitigation in the Yiwu-Ningbo container transport corridor. This finding reveals that the subsidies can serve as short-term solutions, but a policy package, including financial, technological, operational, and managerial measures, is required as a long-term strategy.","[Tao, Xuezong; Wu, Qin] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lichao] Tongji Univ, Sch Transportat Engn, 4800 Caoan Highway, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; Tongji University,"Tao, XZ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, 1550 Haigang Ave, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",xztao@shmtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603162]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [15ZR1420400],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant no. 71603162]; and sponsored by Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [Grant no. 15ZR1420400].The authors would like to thank associate professor Zheng Wan for his valuable work in language improvment, and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.",,37,28,35,24,114,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,265,273,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.049,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800026,0

This study explores the link between using electricity, for either lighting or cooking purposes, and the occurrence of malaria cases using country-representative household level data for Malawi. The descriptive statistics and the econometric results highlight the fact that those household members living in 'electrified' households are more likely to experience malaria. The interpretations behind those results can be diverse; as evidence suggests, malaria vectors are attracted by electric lights and outdoor lighting available after the sunset may change people habits and increases their exposure to those vectors. This study aims at raising the attention to a nexus which has very rarely been studied theoretically and even less empirically, despite the fact that electricity projects are now in the agenda of several Sub-Saharan countries and that malaria still continue to constitute a major threat for an incredible high number of people, most of all children and pregnant women.","[Tasciotti, Luca] Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Tasciotti, Luca] Sch Oriental & African Studies, Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Tasciotti, L (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",tasciotti@iss.nl,,,,,,,27,11,12,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,310,316,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.028,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800032,0

Moreover, a long-term demographic microsimulation must be dynamic and it should preferably also include the relations between individuals.

Results confirm that differences across firms regarding technological capabilities and the role of cooperation cannot be fully appreciated when innovative firms are considered on the same footing, regardless of whether they have been able to develop the new technologies introduced.","[Divella, Marialuisa] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Econ, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Divella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Econ, Bari, Italy.",marialuisa.divella@uniba.it,,"Divella, Marialuisa/0000-0002-0830-1970",,,,,67,5,6,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Interviews with founders and managers of Born Global firms served as a basis for developing the questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is to explore the mode of standardization and adaptation to the foreign markets in marketing mix elements and to identify a base of competitive advantage. In our research we come to the conclusion that with rapid internationalization of markets, hyper-competition and the change to an information intensive economy, the number of firms categorized as Born Globals will increase.

It is also found that the positive impacts of trade shocks on industry entry are enhanced by industry relatedness. This suggests trade shock-induced industrial branching is also path dependent and can be influenced by the pre-existing industry structure of a region.","[Liang, Jiaochen] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Agr Business, Fresno, CA 93740 USA",California State University System; California State University Fresno,"Liang, JC (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Agr Business, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",jiaochenl@csufresno.edu,,,,,,,69,8,11,5,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This is possible by exploiting a database that connects an establishment-reported indicator for embeddedness in clusters with highly reliable longitudinal establishment data. Survival analysis (2001-10) shows that openness towards what the regional value-added chains can offer reduces failure risk by roughly one-third. In addition, embeddedness in clusters has raised 10-year growth of establishments by 16.6% on average.","[Litzel, Nicole] Fed Employment Agcy, Res Inst, IAB Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany; [Litzel, Nicole] City Regensburg, Dept Econ & Res Affairs, Regensburg, Germany",,"Litzel, N (通讯作者)，Fed Employment Agcy, Res Inst, IAB Inst Employment Res, Nurnberg, Germany.;Litzel, N (通讯作者)，City Regensburg, Dept Econ & Res Affairs, Regensburg, Germany.",post@coris-online.de,,,,,,,44,12,14,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In doing so, it argues that local firms can take advantage of these factors to access more resources for industrial upgrading instead of choosing from the limited options offered by previous studies such as state intervention or indigenous innovation.

The introduction of social CRM for society results in changing and adapting communication activities and relational marketing activities to the global environment of social networks, which was our priority when conducting a survey of the selected business entities. The survey was executed not only to obtain a comprehensive overview of the use of social CRM in the global space, but also that of phygital or crossline communication tools that were applied to improve customer communication or customer satisfaction with the main purchasing attributes. The paper describes the case study of a particular business entity to have been researched in more detail.","[Miklencicova, Renata] FMK UCM Trnava, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Miklencicová, R (通讯作者)，FMK UCM Trnava, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava, Slovakia.",rmiklencicova@gmail.com,,"Miklencicova, Renata/0000-0002-7818-1652",,,,,16,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1575,1581,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202066,0

Kosice is a city that has its specific transport problems, whose partial solution may be to increase the support of cycling when one of the options is the introduction of a city bike-sharing system.

They are able to provide products at lower average costs and prices for customers in comparison with domestic competitors, they bring advanced technology to less developed countries, bring jobs and standards, which are same for all countries, improve the quality of life for citizens of host country and contribute to research and development. These activities are connected with capital flows, which have become an important characteristic of the world economy. Foreign investments facilitate the process of globalisation and stimulate economic growth in host countries. On the other hand, MNCs might unfavourably dominate the market, can gain tremendous profits and do not share their wealth, which reflects in small wages of employees from host country. MNCs seek to gain a monopoly position in the industry, often represent a threat to the environment and it results in the displacement of domestic competition from the market.

However, the ICTs generate also new challenges facing businesses and customers. The existing studies have pointed out that cross-border e-commerce has not been internationally widespread and global online trade is not the norm but rather the exception. Following the recent increase in the growth pace of cross-border transactions and results of previous research, this study addresses the question of whether intrinsically global e-commerce but, in fact, seriously affected by many barriers, could in reality be global. The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibilities of e-commerce globalization by bringing together the findings of different research subjects: relations between globalization and e-commerce diffusion, determinants of strictly B2C e-commerce globalizations and foreign expansion strategies for pure digital e-commerce players. The methodology includes desk research and analysis. The main result indicates that intrinsic barriers to B2C e-commerce global expansion, in particular, home bias may be overcame and thus the globalization potential of B2C e-commerce can be fully realized. The most successful way appears the implementation of web globalization strategy.

In the article we focus on its definition, economic and social consequences, causes and ways to limit corruption. Corruption can be understood in a strict sense of the word (legal sense), but also in a broader way (the ethical principles are taken into account too). It relates to the phenomena such as cronyism, nepotism, state capture, lobbying. Consequences of the corruption are seen in many ways, e.g. non-optimal allocation of resources, deformation of competition environment. Corruption and non-transparent rules lead to high administrative intensity and high transaction costs. It may affect investment, economic growth, structure of public spending. In addition to the economic implications, other risks arise, e.g. in a corrupt environment citizens lose trust in state and rules, casting doubt on the rule of law and equality before the law and liberal democracy as such. We monitor the causes of corruption while studying both formal and informal rules. Anti-corruption strategies are generally focused on repression and prevention, but public awareness is very important too. Corruption transactions involve demand and supply sides; thus anti-corruption strategies have to be oriented on both public administration and entrepreneurs. The search for a solutions needs to be seen in a broader context, because the limitation of corruption is related to transparency and public accountability, government effectiveness, rule of law and the functioning of the institutions. International, global initiatives in the area of economics, politics and justice are needed to complement national measures.","[Zemanovicova, Daniela] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia; [Vasakova, Livia] European Commiss, Representat Bratislava, Palisady 29, Bratislava 81106, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Zemanovicová, D (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",daniela.zemanovicova@fm.uniba.sk,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,3069,3075,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205059,0

Therefore, to make the linguistic symbols simple and economical and easy to grasp and use is the polysemous and homophone an important positive effect on language.

To estimate spatial autocorrelation, maximum likelihood has been popularly used. However, its rigorous implementation requires the whole network to be observed. This is practically infeasible if network size is huge (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, WeChat, etc.). In that case, one has to rely on sampled network data to infer about spatial autocorrelation. By doing so, network relationships (i.e., edges) involving unsampled nodes are overlooked. This leads to distorted network structure and underestimated spatial autocorrelation. To solve the problem, we propose here a novel solution. By temporarily assuming that the spatial autocorrelation is small, we are able to approximate the likelihood function by its first-order Taylor's expansion. This leads to the method of approximate maximum likelihood estimator (AMLE), which further inspires the development of paired maximum likelihood estimator (PMLE). Compared with AMLE, PMLE is computationally superior and thus is particularly useful for large-scale network data analysis. Under appropriate regularity conditions (without assuming a small spatial autocorrelation), we show theoretically that PMLE is consistent and asymptotically normal. Numerical studies based on both simulated and real datasets are presented for illustration purpose.","[Zhou, Jing] Renmin Univ China, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Tu, Yundong; Wang, Hansheng] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yuxin] New York Univ Shanghai, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Peking University; NYU Shanghai,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",zhoujing_89@126.com; yundong.tu@gsm.pku.edu.cn; yc18@nyu.edu; hansheng.wang@qq.com,,"Wang, Hansheng/0000-0003-2386-0209","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600155]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11131002, 11271031, 71532001, 11525101]; Business Intelligence Research Center at Peking University; Center for Statistical Science at Peking University; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University; National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 71301004, 71472007]",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Business Intelligence Research Center at Peking University; Center for Statistical Science at Peking University; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Zhou's research is supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant No. 2016M600155.

The econometric results point to the higher weight of neighbourhood environment variables, including indicators of 'coolness', as predictors of computer service employment location.","[Duvivier, Chloe] Irstea, UMR Terr, 9 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-63178 Aubiere, France; [Duvivier, Chloe] Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, INRS, 385 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada",INRAE; VetAgro Sup; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Duvivier, C (通讯作者)，Irstea, UMR Terr, 9 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-63178 Aubiere, France.;Duvivier, C (通讯作者)，Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, INRS, 385 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",chloe.duvivier@irstea.fr; mario.polese@ucs.inrs.ca,,"Duvivier, Chloe/0000-0001-9647-1285",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors acknowledge financial support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship).,,60,13,14,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The multivariate regression analysis covers the period 2011-2016. The rather small merit order effect estimated by an OLS time series model leads to the small decrease of Slovak electricity wholesale prices. This spot price reduction attributable to the photovoltaics does not outweigh the costs of the support scheme borne by end users what implies a consumer loss.","[Janda, Karel] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Janda, Karel] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Janda, K (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",Karel-Janda@seznam.cz,"janda, karel/GNP-1410-2022; janda, karel/A-3951-2008","janda, karel/0000-0001-7096-6300",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [681228]; Czech Science Foundation [16-00027S]; Australian National University ANUCES,European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(Marie Curie Actions); Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Australian National University ANUCES(Australian National University),This paper is part of a project that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant agreement no. 681228.

The coal-rich West and East differ from the coal-poor South and North, in that their pattern is an inverted U-curve, while both North and South have consistently declining energy intensities. Energy intensity peaks about 50 years earlier in the West than in the East. For the first time we have been able to demonstrate that the gap between the West and East actually started in the 1950s, and to single out the main drivers behind the East European inefficiency. It was not general systematic wastefulness or lack of innovations, but surprisingly for a planned economy, it was the inefficiency in the expanding electricity system that accounted for most of the effect, together with the structural change towards heavy industrial production. As much of the industrial production became electrified and powered by less efficient electricity, this had a snowball effect through the whole value chain of the production. The negative impact of the planned economy on energy intensity was largest between 1948 and 1970.","[Nielsen, Hana; Kander, Astrid] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden; [Warde, Paul] Univ Cambridge, Pembroke Coll, Cambridge, England",Lund University; University of Cambridge,"Nielsen, H (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden.",hana.nielsen@ekh.lu.se; psw1000@cam.ac.uk; astrid.kander@ekh.lu.se,,"Kander, Astrid/0000-0002-4186-8338; Nielsen, Hana/0000-0003-0918-5278",,,,,56,13,13,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2018,122.0,,,,,,75,83,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.07.006,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GX2UX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447576700008,0

Although price-based DR programs have shown potential, there is a need to further investigate the effectiveness of DR in energy strategy and policy development. The evaluation of DR has focused on the impact on overall power demand, assuming that consumers are economically rational decision-maker. However, recent findings suggest that consumer responses have been insufficient and calls have been made to identify novel evaluation approaches that better reflect the human dimension of energy consumption. Continuing this line of enquiry, this paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of DR and explore the potential of environmental incentives for increased consumer engagement. We propose an interdisciplinary evaluation framework to understand variations in household responsiveness to DR strategies, which is tested in a Swedish DR field trial covering 136 households during 2017. Results suggest that the effectiveness of DR varies widely across household type; ranging from substantial reductions in overall consumption and during peak periods, to increases in consumption during peak periods. Furthermore, a clear favor of price incentives, compared to environmental incentives, as the most efficient strategy to increase demand flexibility was observed.","[Nilsson, Anders; Lazarevic, David; Brandt, Nils; Kordas, Olga] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Div Ind Ecol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lazarevic, David] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Environm Policy Ctr, PL 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland",Royal Institute of Technology; Finnish Environment Institute,"Nilsson, A (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol KTH, Div Ind Ecol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",anders.nilsson@abe.kth.se; david.lazarevic@abe.kth.se; nils.brandt@abe.kth.se; olga.kordas@abe.kth.se,"Kordas, Olga/V-4718-2018","Kordas, Olga/0000-0002-4830-7832; Lazarevic, David/0000-0002-9869-9707",Smart Energy City Research and Development Program [33213-2]; EU Horizon 2020 InteGrid Research and Innovation Program [731218]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [731218] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,Smart Energy City Research and Development Program; EU Horizon 2020 InteGrid Research and Innovation Program; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),The research presented in this article is supported by the Smart Energy City Research and Development Program (No 33213-2) and the EU Horizon 2020 InteGrid Research and Innovation Program (731218).

Whilst there are some high-level estimates of the potential for buildings energy efficiency in the UK, a more granular assessment is needed to understand exactly where this potential lies and what form it takes. Our analysis fills this gap. It is based on the best available evidence on the remaining potential for energy efficiency improvements within UK residential buildings. Using UK government criteria for investment appraisal, we demonstrate that there is a significant resource of untapped energy-saving opportunities in UK homes. Specifically, our estimates suggest that: one quarter of the energy currently used in UK households could be cost effectively saved by 2035; and this could increase to one half if allowance is made for falling technology costs and the wider benefits of energy efficiency improvements. However, these estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made about capital, energy and carbon costs, and capturing this potential will require both significant policy change and large-scale investment.","[Rosenow, Jan; Sorrell, Steven] Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Rosenow, Jan; Eyre, Nick] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Rosenow, Jan] Regulatory Assistance Project, Rue Sci 23, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium; [Guertler, Pedro] E3G, 47 Great Guildford St, London SE1 0ES, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford,"Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Sussex Energy Grp, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.;Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Regulatory Assistance Project, Rue Sci 23, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",j.rosenow@sussex.ac.uk; pedro.guertler@e3g.org,"Rosenow, Jan/GOJ-9750-2022",,"Research Councils UK [EP/K011790/1]; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1, EP/R014965/1, EP/R035288/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Research Councils UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This paper was enabled through funding from Research Councils UK through their support for the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (Grant no.

As a pillar of the national economy, the CO2 emissions of the metallurgical industry continually increased during 2000-2015 and reached around 3208.65 million tons in 2015. Thus, research on the CO2 emission performance of the metallurgical industry is significant for achieving binding emission reduction targets in China's 13th Five-Year Plan as well as constructing clean and low carbon energy system based on the directives of the 19th CPC National Congress. Taking regional heterogeneity into consideration, we construct a Metafrontier Malmquist CO2 Emissions Performance Index (MMCPI) to conducts a multi-dimensional analysis of the CO2 emissions performance in metallurgical industry of China, focusing on the CO2 emission efficiency, the main influencing factors of carbon performance and CO2 emission reduction potentials. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the paper finds that technological progress change was the main factor contributing to the improvement of the CO2 emissions efficiency of the metallurgical industry. Under the meta-frontier, Central and Western China still have a CO2 emissions reduction potential of 75.3% and 81.1% correspondingly. Under the group-frontier, the lowest reduction potential in Eastern, Central and Western China is in Jiangsu, Hubei and Chongqing respectively.","[Lin, Boqiang; Xu, Mengmeng] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Xu, Mengmeng/0000-0003-1982-8898",State Grid Corporation technology project [SGFJJY00JJJS1700025]; Report Series from Ministry of Education of China [10JBG013]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; China National Social Science Fund [17AZD013],State Grid Corporation technology project; Report Series from Ministry of Education of China; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; China National Social Science Fund,"The paper is supported by the State Grid Corporation technology project (No. SGFJJY00JJJS1700025), Report Series from Ministry of Education of China (No. 10JBG013), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No. 1260-Y07200), and China National Social Science Fund (No. 17AZD013).",,42,99,99,15,150,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2018,120.0,,,,,,302,311,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.050,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO6DC,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000440123300029,0

In this context, we established a scenario analysis using system dynamics model to analyze the development of EV in China under policy incentives. Four scenarios were set in this paper: scenario 1 (Without any policy), scenario 2 (Only direct policy), scenario 3 (Only indirect policy), scenario 4 (Both direct & indirect policy). It is shown that the EV industry was in preliminary stage in 2010. After a period of development, in 2040, the total amount of EVs will reach 4.03, 8.61, 4.2 and 8.85 million in scenario 1-4. The results indicate that China's EV market penetration is mainly dominated by state policies, especially the financial supports. Reducing the governments' financial supports for EVs will put EV manufacturers at a cost disadvantage in the automobile markets. In addition, because of our emerging carbon market and low average carbon price, participating in carbon trading market cannot promote a rapid growth by stimulating investment passion. In all, cutting the financial supports is not a good option, because the large-scale market penetration still requires the clear and strong policy incentives.","[Liu, Dunnan] North China Elect Power Univ, State Key Lab Alternate Elect Power Syst Renewabl, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dunnan] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Bowen] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University; Beihang University,"Xiao, BW (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",15353638996@163.com,,"xiao, bowen/0000-0003-3029-5527",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401055]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015MS19]; Beijing Social Science Fund [15JDJGB034],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Beijing Social Science Fund,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71401055); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 2015MS19); the Beijing Social Science Fund (Grant no. 15JDJGB034).

The original LSA of 1947 prohibited women from working overtime exceeding two hours a day; six hours a week; and 150 hours a year. The 1985 Amendments exempted a variety of occupations and industries from such an overtime restriction on women. Applying a difference-in-difference model to census data, we find causal evidence pointing to the positive effect of this particular piece of labour market deregulation on the proportion of female employment.

Our contribution consists of applying spatial econometric models to better understand pricing behaviour in US gasoline markets and the spatial phenomena unique to this particular industry. We find that neighbouring state-level gasoline price variation explains a large portion of the variation of in-state (or local) gasoline prices. Consistent with intuition, the empirical results imply that wholesale gasoline prices are positively affected by state and federal-level gasoline content regulations. Further, our results suggest that changes in state-level wholesale gasoline prices respond to both in-state and neighbouring-state inventory levels.","[Kuchert, Oleg] Frostburg State Univ, Dept Econ, Guild Ctr, 101 Braddock Rd, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Burnett, J.

The empirical estimation uses a new data set of hourly data on both market variables and temperature variables. There is a vast body of literature on the effect of temperature on final consumers and on wholesale electricity market equilibrium. However, the influence of temperature on the behavior of the wholesale electricity market has not been studied at the hourly level. A new econometric estimation shows some evidence of different effects of temperature and provides a more accurate estimation of the hourly prices. Forecasting out-of-sample performance of the model is satisfactory. The present results have welfare-improving policy implications, because appropriate policy strategies can help public decision-makers promote regulation, such as issuing public weather alert and designing contingent plans to face extreme weather conditions, which improves production efficiency, network management, and consumer saving behavior, taking specific weather conditions into account.","[Bigerna, Simona] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Bigerna, S (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",simona.bigema@unipg.it,,,,,,,43,12,13,1,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,257,269,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.068,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000024,0

Our results showed three dimensions of energy management practices (EMP) top management commitment, energy awareness, and energy auditing which were positively associated with the development of RESC initiatives. We found that insufficient knowledge of energy efficiency means firms struggle to manage energy effectively, constraining opportunities such as converting waste into energy to support business' targets. Our work has implications for energy policy. For example, we suggest that the transfer of energy efficiency management knowledge and technology from multinational to local companies could help to improve energy usage, and that local companies could generate renewable energy through supply chain networks. The findings of this work shed light on how to further develop energy efficiency policy in emerging economies, with implications for academics, practitioners and decision-makers.

This paper examines the type and quality of innovation arising from the LCNF. Novel frameworks for assessing innovation project activity and learning are presented and results from their application to the LCNF are discussed. Reduction of uncertainty through the production of high quality evidence is argued to be the primary purpose of innovation project funding support. The analysis of LCNF project activity finds a step change in Research Development & Demonstration (RD&D) spend and stakeholder engagement by network licensees in Britain; however, the innovation observed was considered to be conservative and incremental in nature. It was found that the LCNF lacked a strategic approach to targeted learning and the reduction of uncertainty for innovation priority areas. Project learning outputs were contradictory and inconclusive for several innovations. Strategic learning should be a core part of policy makers' design of innovation funding mechanisms for energy technology, and a framework for shaping, capturing and assessing the learning outputs of funded innovation projects is essential.","[Frame, Damien; Bell, Keith; McArthur, Stephen] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 99 George St, Glasgow G1 1RD, Lanark, Scotland; [Hannon, Matthew] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde; University of Strathclyde,"Frame, D (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 99 George St, Glasgow G1 1RD, Lanark, Scotland.",damien.frame@strath.ac.uk,"Hannon, Matthew/AAW-8266-2021","Hannon, Matthew/0000-0002-7811-3991; Bell, Keith/0000-0001-9612-7345; McArthur, Stephen/0000-0003-1312-8874",research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre [EP/L024756/1]; research programme of the HubNet [EP/N030028/1],research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre; research programme of the HubNet,"This work has been carried out as part of the research programmes of the UK Energy Research Centre (Grant EP/L024756/1, www.ukerc.ac.uk/) and HubNet (Grant EP/N030028/1).",,58,8,9,4,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,121,132,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.033,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000013,0

We construct a model of regional multi-pole growth evolution to study its mechanism based on the assumption of heterogeneous space and inseparability of the economic subject. The study concludes that the evolution of regional multi-pole growth is affected by factors such as transportation costs, economies of scale, the crowding-out effect, and the factor endowments of superior location and inferior location. Based on the condition that the factor endowment of a location remains the same, with an increased economy of scale effect and a decline in the marginal production cost advantage, location will strengthen the agglomeration layout, which does not help form regional multi-pole growth patterns. With an increase of the crowding-out effect and a decline in the marginal production cost disadvantage, location will strengthen the dispersed layout, which fosters the formation of the regional multi-pole growth pattern. When transportation costs are high, a decline in such costs strengthens the links among locations, fostering the evolution of the regional spatial organization form to shift from dispersion to agglomeration. However, when transportation costs are somewhat reduced, their further reduction leads the regional spatial organization pattern into dispersion. Therefore, under certain conditions and with a decline in transportation costs, regional multi-pole growth weakens first and then strengthens.","[Jia, Shanming; Qin, Chenglin] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Xinyue] Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, Kent, OH 44242 USA",Jinan University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Ye, XY (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",jamesstrong551@gmail.com; zhanyaxu2016@gmail.com; xye5@kent.edu,"ye, xinyue/A-7677-2011","ye, xinyue/0000-0001-8838-9476",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601111]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17AJL011]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030310523],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"Funding was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41601111), National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 17AJL011), and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2015A030310523).",,40,4,4,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The focus is to explore variation across tenure modes (rented or owner-occupied residences). Bivariate probits are used to correct for endogenous determination of tenure mode and energy efficiency outcomes. Results suggest that, when compared to renters, homeowners are significantly more likely to have energy-efficient appliances. The mechanisms that could be driving those differences are also investigated. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that rented dwellings are more likely to have efficient appliances when landlords incur utility payments. Adoption rate differences are also shown to be inversely related to energy prices. Those findings are consistent with a problem of asymmetric information in the housing market, typically referred to as the landlord-tenant problem. This paper is also the first to assess how tenancy duration influences efficiency investments in this context. Results suggest that investments in rented homes are more likely to occur at later periods of tenancy, when relations between landlords and tenants might be better established.","[Souza, M. N.

In the climate sphere, we examine the effectiveness of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI). Using principles from governance and public administration about the effectiveness of institutions, we examine the extent to which four networks have contributed to improving governance outcomes in the spheres of climate and sustainable energy. Our evaluation focuses on the clarity of purpose, funding, institutional formality, efficacy, and level of resilience of these networks. Some differences notwithstanding, we find that the transnational governance networks generally fail to meet the criteria about what constitutes an effective institution.

In the electricity sector, one drawback of such policies is the negative impact on electricity prices, known as the merit-order effect. This paper aims at assessing how intermittent renewable production depresses electricity prices in Germany, which has experienced a significant increase of its renewable capacity over the last two decades. To do so, we use a two regime Markov switching model, that enables to disentangle the impact of wind and solar generation, depending on the price being high or low. We find as expected that renewable production induces a negative marginal effect, which is stronger in regimes of relatively high prices. In addition, we show that both wind and solar productions have a significant impact on the distribution of prices, and in particular on the frequency and expected duration of each regime.

The president's pledge to transition toward renewable energy represented a dramatic change in Korean energy policy, which has been focused on nuclear and coal-fired plant expansion policies since the 1970s. This study examines public perception of energy, with focus on the relationship between nuclear power and climate change as well as party preferences, based on a nationally representative survey of Korea. The survey data shows that the risk-risk tradeoff strategy, reframing nuclear power generation as a way to mitigate the risks of climate change, seems to be ineffective in Korea. Furthermore, nuclear power represents the values of the elderly, materialists, developmentalists, and conservative political parties. These results suggest that Korean energy policy is a very political issue rather than a strictly scientific or economic one. Therefore, this issue should be deliberated through a democratic process.","[Chung, Ji-Bum] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, UNIST Gil 50, Ulsan 689798, South Korea; [Kim, Eun-Sung] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Sociol, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Kyung Hee University,"Kim, ES (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Sociol, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",learning@unist.ac.kr; eskim711@khu.ac.kr,", 김은성/P-5612-2019; Kim, Eun-sung/N-2807-2018; Chung, Ji-Bum/AAH-7479-2021",", 김은성/0000-0001-8567-524X; Chung, Ji-Bum/0000-0003-2388-9917",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A2B4003165]; Future Energy Policy Institute of Kyung Hee University [20161556],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Future Energy Policy Institute of Kyung Hee University,"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (Grant No. NRF-2017R1A2B4003165) and the Future Energy Policy Institute of Kyung Hee University (grant number, 20161556).",,38,80,84,4,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2018,116.0,,,,,,137,144,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GD8JH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430758200014,0

The paper focuses on the emerging encounter between existing social, technological, regulatory, and institutional regimes in electricity systems in Canada, the United States, and the European Union, and the niche level development of advanced energy storage technologies. The structure of electricity systems as vertically integrated monopolies, or liberalized or semi-liberalized markets, is found to provide different mechanisms for niche formation and niche to regime transition pathways for energy storage. Significant trade-offs among these pathways are identified. The overwhelming bulk of energy storage policy development activities are found to be taking place in liberalized or semi-liberalized markets. The key policy debates in these markets relate to technical barriers to market participation by storage resources, the ability of storage technologies to offer multiple services in markets simultaneously, the lack of clear rules related to the aggregation of distributed energy resources, and issues related to the meaning of technological neutrality in liberalized market systems. Landscape conditions, particularly jurisdictional commitments to pursue deliberate re-configurations of their energy systems towards low-carbon energy sources, emerge as the most significant factor in the implementation of policy reforms in these areas.","[Winfield, Mark; Shokrzadeh, Shahab; Jones, Adam] York Univ, Sustainable Energy Initiat, Fac Environm Studies, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Winfield, M (通讯作者)，York Univ, Sustainable Energy Initiat, Fac Environm Studies, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",marksw@yorku.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NESRC) of Canada Energy Storage Technology Network (NEST) [NETGP 468468-14],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NESRC) of Canada Energy Storage Technology Network (NEST),The authors thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NESRC) of Canada File No: NETGP 468468-14 Energy Storage Technology Network (NEST) for its support of this research.,,77,49,52,7,44,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2018,115.0,,,,,,572,583,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.029,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA1TH,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428099800054,0

This research adopts the meta-frontier non-radial directional distance function based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) window analysis to measure the total factor energy efficiency and carbon emission performance of leading countries involved in CDM projects during 1990-2015. This study employs the panel quantile regression to investigate the dynamic impact of CDM projects on different energy efficiency and carbon emission performance of CDM host countries. The results indicate that, first of all, the total factor energy efficiency and carbon emission performance of CDM host countries appear much lower than those of investment countries. Second, the technology gap of energy-use and carbon emissions reduction between CDM host and investment countries is significant. Finally, with the increase of total factor energy efficiency and carbon emission performance in CDM host countries, the impact of CDM projects on their energy efficiency is always negative, and that on their carbon emission performance gradually varies from positive to negative, meaning that CDM projects are not necessarily helpful to improve the energy efficiency and carbon emission performance in host countries.","[Zhang, Yue-Jun; Sun, Ya-Fang] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun; Sun, Ya-Fang] Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun; Huang, Junling] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Energy & Climate Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Huang, Junling] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Huang, Junling] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Hunan University; Hunan University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University; Harvard University,"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zyjmis@126.com,"Zhang, Yue-Jun/A-8850-2012","Zhang, Yue-Jun/0000-0001-7687-9267","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273028, 71322103, 71774051]; National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China; Changjiang Scholars Program of the Ministry of Education of China; Hunan Youth Talent Program; China Scholarship Council [201606135020]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China; Changjiang Scholars Program of the Ministry of Education of China; Hunan Youth Talent Program; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71273028, 71322103 and 71774051), National Special Support Program for High-Level Personnel from the Central Government of China, Changjiang Scholars Program of the Ministry of Education of China, Hunan Youth Talent Program and China Scholarship Council (No. 201606135020).

The complexity of the issue requires a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluate the availability of net energy, environmental aspects and technical performance. Hence, the comparison between scenarios includes short-term and long-term energy metrics as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) and technical metrics. Also, the paper considers the viewpoints offered by both an integrative and a dynamic approach to net energy analysis. Results for all five analysed scenarios indicate that increased PV deployment will not be detrimental to the UK grid performance from the points of view of a wide range of system-level technical (% renewable energy curtailment to ensure grid stability), energy (energy return on investment and non-renewable cumulative energy demand) and environmental (greenhouse gas emissions) metrics.","[Raugei, Marco] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford, England; [Leccisi, Enrica] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sci & Technol, Naples, Italy; [Azzopardi, Brian] MCAST, Inst Engn & Transport, MCAST Energy Res Grp, Rahal Gdid, Malta; [Azzopardi, Brian] Brian Azzopardi & Associates Consulting Firm, Birkirkara, Malta; [Jones, Christopher; Gilbert, Paul; Mander, Sarah] Univ Manchester, Sch Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Zhang, Lingxi; Zhou, Yutian; Mancarella, Pierluigi] Univ Manchester, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England",Oxford Brookes University; Parthenope University Naples; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Raugei, M (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Math Sci, Oxford, England.",marco.raugei@brookes.ac.uk,"Leccisi, Enrica/AAD-4624-2019; Raugei, Marco/N-4737-2015; Azzopardi, Brian/X-4413-2019; Gilbert, Paul/HKM-3610-2023; Zhang, Lingxi/AAH-3897-2019; Jones, Christopher/T-6979-2018","Leccisi, Enrica/0000-0002-4166-8555; Raugei, Marco/0000-0001-5026-8556; Azzopardi, Brian/0000-0002-7776-9390; Zhang, Lingxi/0000-0003-1305-5222; Jones, Christopher/0000-0002-5428-0015; Mancarella, Pierluigi/0000-0002-9247-1402",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the WISE-PV project [EP/K022229/1]; Malta Council for Science and Technology [IPAS-2016-015]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K022229/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K022229/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the WISE-PV project; Malta Council for Science and Technology; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This research was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the WISE-PV project (Grant EP/K022229/1).

In Chile, the law mandates that all distribution companies must hold long-term contracts - which are awarded on a competitive centralized auction - to cover 100% of the projected demand from three to fifteen years into the future. These contracts can be indexed to a series of financial parameters, including fossil fuel prices at reference locations. Drawing from portfolio theory, we use a simple example to illustrate the difficulties of selecting, through the current clearing mechanism that focuses on average costs and individual characteristics of the offers, a portfolio of long-term energy contracts that could simultaneously minimize the expected future cost of energy and limit the risk exposure of retail customers. In particular, we show that if the objective of the regulator is to limit the risk to regulated consumers, it could be optimal to include contracts that would not be selected based on individual characteristics of the offers and a least-cost auction objective, but that could significantly reduce the price variance of the overall portfolio due to diversification effects between indexing parameters.","[Reus, Lorenzo; Munoz, Francisco D.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile; [Moreno, Rodrigo] Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Moreno, Rodrigo] Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad de Chile; Imperial College London,"Munoz, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Diagonal Las Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",fdmunoz@uai.cl,"Moreno Vieyra, Rodrigo Andres/AHD-6298-2022; Muñoz, Francisco/AHD-1365-2022; Reus, Lorenzo/D-7112-2016","Moreno Vieyra, Rodrigo Andres/0000-0001-5538-445X; Reus, Lorenzo/0000-0001-9171-7688","FONDECYT [11150029, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019, 11170012]; CONICYT-Basal Project [FB0008]; Complex Engineering Systems Institute (CONICYTCONICYT) [FB0816, ICM P-05-004-F]; Energy Center of the University of Chile and Newton [Picarte/MR/N026721/1]; [Fondef/ID15I10592]",FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT-Basal Project; Complex Engineering Systems Institute (CONICYTCONICYT); Energy Center of the University of Chile and Newton;,"The research in this article was supported by FONDECYT #11150029, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019 (SERC-CHILE), CONICYT-Basal Project FB0008, the Complex Engineering Systems Institute (CONICYTCONICYT - PIA - FB0816; ICM P-05-004-F), Fondef/ID15I10592, FONDECYT #11170012, The Energy Center of the University of Chile and Newton-Picarte/MR/N026721/1.

Document research and semi-structured interviews with strategically selected local persons were conducted, supplemented by existing local knowledge. Citizen cooperatives in Lower Franconia have built numerous wind farms, were forerunners in commercial photovoltaics and provided political impetus for Germany's renewable energy subsidy law. But locals report disillusionment with recent neoliberal trends that lead to well financed absentee investors buying up renewable energy siting rights, manoeuvring and pricing locals out of business, while government demands local access for an electricity superhighway that will serve other regions. The paper investigates local actors' perceptions of power plays between themselves and outside investors and policymakers, using Geels' schema of instrumental, material, institutional and discursive power. It finds locals outmanoeuvred and losing control, to outside interests, of what has been a significant contribution to the Energiewende, while their wider local economy and solidarity are being undermined. The paper recommends policymakers avoid framing regional groups as problems to be solved and, instead act to support and harness their unique social resources for a more socially acceptable Energiewende.","[Galvin, Ray] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; E-ON,"Galvin, R (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",rgalvin@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,"Galvin, Ray/ABC-8642-2020; Galvin, Ray/AAC-3020-2022","Galvin, Ray/0000-0001-9279-4263",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [RWTH 16 2 99 816110 0006],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The author gratefully acknowledges funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (RWTH 16 2 99 816110 0006) (BMBF) within the Kopernikus Project 'ENSURE: New Energy grid structures for the German Energiewende'.

Depending on the regulatory framework and demand structure of the respective country, the necessary expansion measures being taken are disparately affecting different regions. With the underlying public support for the energy system transformation taking place across Europe crucial to its success, mechanisms to facilitate a cost-reflective and non-discriminatory cost distribution should be investigated. Based on a classification of critical factors responsible for regional discrepancies, we model and estimate residential customers' tariffs in Germany and their regional distributional disparities while assessing various reform measures. The findings show that the overall tariff rates in Germany and the already existing regional disparities are poised to increase substantially by 2025. A tariff corridor and deep first connection charges considerably limit tariffs and increase distributional equity amongst regions. A generation tariff alters the distribution and reduces the highest tariffs. An energy-based tariff that neglects the impact of pro-sumers further aggravates the regional distributional disparities. This paper gives insights into the challenges of cost allocation within electricity grids and intends to help to design an adequate and fair cost allocation mechanism.","[Hinz, Fabian; Schmidt, Matthew; Moest, Dominik] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Energy Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Hinz, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Chair Energy Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",Fabian.Hinz@tu-dresden.de; Matthew.Schmidt@tu-dresden.de; Dominik.Moest@tu-dresden.de,,"Most, Dominik/0000-0001-7170-3596","Sachsische Staatskanzlei (Saxon State Chancellery), Energieforen Leipzig; 50Hertz Transmission GmbH","Sachsische Staatskanzlei (Saxon State Chancellery), Energieforen Leipzig; 50Hertz Transmission GmbH","This work was supported by the Sachsische Staatskanzlei (Saxon State Chancellery), Energieforen Leipzig and by 50Hertz Transmission GmbH.",,48,19,19,0,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,97,111,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.055,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500012,0

However, most municipalities no longer have operational control over these aspects of the energy system. Instead, many municipalities have initiated proactive, strategic energy and climate planning. Prior to a potential legislative revision, the current energy planning practice is examined with regards to the propagation of these different energy planning approaches and the influence of municipal energy planning on comprehensive planning. This study shows that 61% of Sweden's 290 municipalities adopted an EP during 2004-2015. Most of these EPs had a broad scope, and it is shown that during the studied time frame the focus of the municipal energy planning gradually shifted towards mitigating climate change. The municipalities' population size also has a significant effect on the propagation and currentness of energy planning. Furthermore, municipal energy and climate planning increases the potential for ensuring the consideration of energy and climate targets and strategies in comprehensive planning, which can facilitate a more sustainability-led municipal planning in line with the Swedish energy and climate objectives, and this relation is thus urged to be strengthened.","[Wretling, Vincent; Gunnarsson-Ostling, Ulrika; Balfors, Berit] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hornberg, Christina] Environm Law & Dev Ctr Sweden AB, SE-11434 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Wretling, V (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",vincentw@kth.se; ug@kth.se; c.homberg@gmail.com; balfors@kth.se,"; Balfors, Berit/A-7691-2018","Wretling, Vincent/0000-0002-0412-6845; /0000-0003-3101-5902; Balfors, Berit/0000-0003-0214-3921",Swedish Energy Agency [41347-1],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency),"This work was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency (project number 41347-1).

This paper proposes the use of a long-memory approach and a rolling-windows method to model the time-varying oil gas price relationship in three markets, namely, the United States, Europe and Japan. The results extend existing research conclusions on the oil gas price relationship and answer the question of whether it is a temporary phenomenon or a permanent market change. Our findings indicate that the US oil gas relationship remains nonstationary at almost all windows and illustrate strong evidence of decoupling. Conversely, the European and Asian oil gas prices exhibit temporary decoupling over time, although the overall relationship still favours the oil-indexation hypothesis. The US experience suggests that oil and gas do not share the same fundamentals and a pricing hub can better reflect the true value of natural gas. Policy makers in Europe and Asia should reinforce their efforts towards a market based pricing mechanism for gas.","[Zhang, Dayong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",jqwxnjq@163.com,"Zhang, Dayong/ABD-4989-2021; Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021; Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020; Wu, Fei/T-6613-2019","Zhang, Dayong/0000-0001-8722-176X; Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573214, 71774152, 91546109]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7 X 0231505]; 111 Project [B16040]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","Supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71573214, No. 71774152, No. 91546109, Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant: Y7 X 0231505), and the 111 Project under Grant No. B16040 are acknowledged.",,43,66,71,0,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,68,75,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.046,0.0,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500008,0

The major needs emerged in the case investigated are for an increase of actors' expectations towards the further development of the sector, and a need for a tailored networking activity, devoted to attracting specific knowledgeable actors. The results indicate that, among others, effective policy instruments are, in this case, the cooperation that has the best outcome in terms of networking, and the public procurement, which remarkably increases the level of expectation.

International auditing standards are the core set of standards to be applied to each audit of financial statements engagement. Auditors adhere to professional standards and legal and regulatory requirements while performing financial statement audits. Those standards require that appropriate professional skepticism be applied in the exercise of professional judgment. The widespread and diversification of business in this modern day, has continued to increase the complexity of business transactions and of accounting standards (Dimitrova - Sorova, 2016). Deviating or non-compliance with the standards may cause, that the audit will not to be performed correctly, and this fact may lead to the wrong auditor's opinion on the financial statements. In relation to statutory requirements, auditors and audit firms are subject to regular quality control for an audit by regulatory authorities. In the case of the Slovak Republic, the regulatory body means the Slovak Chamber of Auditors and the Audit Oversight Office. The purpose of quality control is, in particular, the complete audit documentation for an audit engagement. Quality control focuses to demonstrate the compliance with international auditing standards (Kares - Knazkova, 2016.). A quality control review is performed on a regular basis, every 3 years for audits in public interest entities and every 6 years for audits in other entities. The deficiencies revealed during the quality control review often reveal the imperfections of the audit documentation, for example due to non-compliance with the requirements of international auditing standards, possibly by omitting part of the mandatory documentation or violating the requirements of statutory standards. The auditor's documentation, which is fully and correctly compiled in accordance with professional standards, provides an appropriate basis for the auditor's opinion on the financial statements and at the same time, it protects the auditor from potential future disputes.","[Kriskova, Petra; Uzik, Jan] Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",,"Krisková, P (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Informat, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",petra.kriskova@euba.sk; jan.uzik@euba.sk,,,[APVV-16-0602 Zvysovanie relevantnosti uctovnych informacii v SR -od nakladov k hodnote],,This paper is an output of the science project: APVV-16-0602 Zvysovanie relevantnosti uctovnych informacii v SR -od nakladov k hodnote,,15,0,0,5,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1684,1690,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300215,0

In order for any market entity, whether household, business or state, to work it has to plan and therefore to predict market developments, with ideally the smallest deviation. The overall setting of the business environment is very complex in today's globalized world. That is why it is very important to measure whether, under the given conditions and in the given environment, it is successful in managing the administration of itself. We can certainly do this by assessing the standard of living of the population, but also through the prediction of GDP. GDP is a very interesting indicator of state success. It can not only indicate past success but also predict the future behavior of the state. The environment of the national economy is very heterogeneous. The aim of the paper is to analyze, on the example of the Czech Republic, the impact of individual branches of the national economy on the development of the national economy as a whole. This is how we described the developments so far and we will be able to predict future GDP developments. For the analysis, GDP data for the economy as a whole and for each sector were used.

Specifically, it analyses the relevance of variety in the case of local knowledge as well as in the case of the knowledge coming from other regions. At the local level, it shows that while related variety is conducive to regional innovation, unrelated variety does play a role, too, when it comes to radical innovations. Conversely, it also shows that external knowledge flows have a higher impact, the higher the similarity between these flows and the extant local knowledge base.

In diesem Beitrag analysieren wir anhand des Falls der europaischen Regionen, ob die Erzeugung neuen Wissens von der Kombination ahnlicher oder unterschiedlicher Elemente vorhandener Technologien profitiert, was ihren technologischen Gehalt (verbundene oder unverbundene Vielfalt) anbelangt. Insbesondere wird die Relevanz der Vielfalt im Fall des lokalen Wissens sowie im Fall des von anderen Regionen kommenden Wissens untersucht. Auf lokaler Ebene zeigt sich, dass verbundene Vielfalt zwar zu regionaler Innovation fuhrt, aber auch unverbundene Vielfalt eine Rolle spielt, wenn es um radikale Innovationen geht. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich, dass externe Wissensstrome eine umso starkere Auswirkung haben, je hoher die Ahnlichkeit zwischen diesen Stromen und der vorhandenen lokalen Wissensbasis ausfallt.

En concreto, examinamos la relevancia de la variedad en el caso del conocimiento local, asi como en el caso del conocimiento que viene de otras regiones. En el ambito local, se observa que aunque la variedad relacionada es favorable a la innovacion regional, la variedad no relacionada tambien desempena un papel en lo que respecta a las innovaciones radicales. Asimismo se muestra que los flujos del conocimiento externo tienen un impacto mas alto cuanto mas alta es la similitud entre estos flujos y la base actual del conocimiento local.","[Miguelez, Ernest] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Barcelona, Spain; [Miguelez, Ernest; Moreno, Rosina] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Barcelona, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); University of Barcelona,"Moreno, R (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Barcelona, Spain.",ernest.miguelez@u-bordeaux.fr; rmoreno@ub.edu,"Miguelez, Ernest/A-1254-2017; Moreno, Rosina/D-4723-2014","Miguelez, Ernest/0000-0002-8224-6842; Moreno, Rosina/0000-0002-3500-8622",project 'Redes de colaboracion tecnologica e innovacion.

The theoretical part is based on the concept of economic awareness, in which economic knowledge is one of the elements. Several questions from a comprehensive questionnaire, which concerns every element of economic awareness, will be empirically analysed. There are questions about economic knowledge and phenomena in the global economy. The following questions will be answered: What is the knowledge about economic concepts amongst the young generation of V4 countries?

On the other hand, globalization also showed itself in several financial crises, which had a significant risk effect for the investor. One possible tool to protect investor's capital against bad results is diversification where an investor spreads their capital among more investments. However, the problem of diversification occurs if the investor selects to his portfolio only loss ones. In this situation, the only result is loss. In our research, we solved this theoretical and practical issue by the Ideal Equity Curve (IEC). The IEC is only a hypothetical benchmark. By the IEC we compare the minimum needed level of the future portfolio performance with the performance of each investment. In simple terms, the IEC decision-making algorithm allows those instruments to the final portfolio that outperform the IEC in time. By this active diversification, the investor assigns higher weights to the instruments that outperform the IEC and excludes those that underperform the IEC. In this paper, we represent the concept of the IEC and the way it is used in the portfolio construction. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the performance of several portfolios constructed by the concept of the IEC versus naive diversification, in terms of highly correlated markets and to demonstrate that the IEC can bring investors not only an appropriate form of capital protection but also the potential to maximize their profits.","[Virdzek, Tomas] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Res & Innovat Ctr, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Kubaska, Peter; Uradnicek, Vladimir] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Kubaska, P (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",tomas.virdzek@umb.sk; peter.kubaska@umb.sk; vladimir.uradnicek@umb.sk,"Virdzek, Tomáš/ACQ-0740-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1919,1926,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300245,0

This is a trend caused by the greening of the European power grid which is to be carbon neutral by 2050. As a part of this trend, the number of power-producing buildings is growing. Even in Norway, which has a highly centralized power production based on hydropower, buildings are increasingly equipped with solar power panels. The introduction of cross-sectoral innovations like power producing buildings is likely to encounter resistance, as the conventional system and its powerful actors are challenged. The strategies to either promote or block the growth of power producing buildings in Norway have been explored employing the Strategic Niche Management framework. For this paper, 32 interviews were conducted with decision-makers and experts, both advocates and opponents of power-producing buildings. It has been found that narratives have the potential to work as a bridging device between the niche and the regime. If the narrative supporting power-producing buildings should become a bridging device, it would have to address challenges as defined by the regime incumbents. In Norway, this would be equivalent to addressing the challenge of peak load.","[Kvellheim, Ann Kristin] Norwegian Univ Technol & Sci, Ctr Technol & Soc, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kvellheim, AK (通讯作者)，SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Hogskoleringen 7B, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",ann.kristin.kvellheim@ntnu.no,,,ZEB partners; Research Council of Norway,ZEB partners; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"I would like to thank Thomas Berker, Margrethe Aune and Birgit Risholt for helpful comments and discussions during the process of writing this paper.

The study reveals that the import demands of the international market for China's new energy industry dominate the fluctuations in the export trade of the industry. Moreover, there are different reasons for the fluctuations in the different export markets of China's new energy industry as well as the export trade fluctuations in the subdivision industries. To promote the development of China's new energy industry, numerous policy suggestions are proposed. These include culturing domestic markets, solving problems in the grid-connection and consumption of new energies, and carrying out international cooperation. Some corresponding suggestions for subdivision industries of the new energy industry are also presented.","[Wang, Zheng-Xin; Zheng, Hong-Hao; Jin, Tong] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng-Xin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Res Regulat & Policy, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Pei, Ling-Ling] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, ZX (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zxwang@zufe.edu.cn; woshihonghao@foxmail.com; alex_done@163.com; masterjt@sina.com,,"Wang, Zheng-xin/0000-0003-0337-2566","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571157, 71373226]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [2016M590527]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),The authors are grateful to the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.

Rising energy consumption and the environmental impacts by freight vehicles is constantly monitored through the introduction of stringent emission standards and through the promotion of fuel efficiency policies. However, little information is available on freight activity data (vehicle-kilometre) and their fleet characteristics (vehicle age, annual mileage, fuel economy etc.) to assess these policies. Therefore, the paper analyses the existing fleet characteristics in terms of age, annual mileage, fuel economy, fuel type used etc. for the freight vehicles used for interstate or intercity mobility on National Highways. Origin-Destination surveys and traffic volume counts are conducted at ten locations along major National Highways to capture the fleet characteristics. Based on the results, emission outlook for the proposed emission standards and fuel economy standards for freight vehicles is presented. Significant emission reductions are expected if emission standards are nationwide and timely implemented. Further, the requirement of country representative survival rates is highlighted.","[Malik, Leeza; Tiwari, Geetam] Indian Inst Technol, Transportat Res & Injury Prevent Programme, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Malik, L (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Transportat Res & Injury Prevent Programme, New Delhi 110016, India.",leezamalik@yahoo.com; geetamt@gmail.com,"Tiwari, Geetam/ABH-5766-2020; Malik, Leeza/AAK-1445-2021","Malik, Leeza/0009-0009-8840-546X; Malik, Dr.Leeza/0000-0001-6681-5278","Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, New Delhi, Delhi, India [G15 SSEF-178]","Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, New Delhi, Delhi, India","The research is partially funded by Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation (G15 SSEF-178), New Delhi, Delhi, India.",,65,21,21,3,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,121,133,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.053,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800013,0

As fast charging is a relatively new technology, very little research is conducted on the topic using real world datasets, and it is of utmost importance to measure actual usage of this technology and provide evidence on its importance to properly inform infrastructure planning. 90,000 fast charge events collected from the first large-scale roll-outs and evaluation projects of fast charging infrastructure in the UK and the US and 12,700 driving days collected from 35 BEVs in the UK were analysed. Using multiple regression analysis, we examined the relationship between daily driving distance and standard and fast charging and demonstrated that fast chargers are more influential. Fast chargers enabled using BEVs on journeys above their single-charge range that would have been impractical using standard chargers. Fast chargers could help overcome perceived and actual range barriers, making BEVs more attractive to future users. At current BEV market share, there is a vital need for policy support to accelerate the development of fast charge networks.","[Neaimeh, Myriam; Hill, Graeme A.; Blythe, Philip T.] Newcastle Univ, Transport Operat Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Salisbury, Shawn D.; Scoffield, Don R.; Francfort, James E.] Idaho Natl Lab, Adv Transportat Grp, Idaho Falls, ID USA",Newcastle University - UK; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Idaho National Laboratory,"Neaimeh, M (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Transport Operat Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",Myriam.neaimeh@newcastle.ac.uk,"Salisbury, Shawn D/B-9009-2017","Blythe, Phil/0000-0003-2134-1253","RCN; UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the LC Transform [EP/N010612/1]; iBuild [EP/K012398/1]; Vehicle Technologies Office, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy; EPSRC [EP/K012398/1, EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N010612/1, EP/K012398/1] Funding Source: researchfish","RCN; UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the LC Transform(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); iBuild; Vehicle Technologies Office, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Newcastle University's authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions and support of the RCN project Partners and the support of the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the LC Transform (EP/N010612/1) and iBuild (EP/K012398/1) research grant awards.; Idaho National Lab's work on this study was funded, in part, by the Vehicle Technologies Office, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy.; The authors gratefully acknowledge the detailed and thoughtful comments of the reviewers and colleagues.",,66,122,133,3,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,SEP,2017,108.0,,,,,,474,486,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.06.033,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FC3FZ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406725800045,0

However, in the light of rising retail electricity prices and falling costs for rooftop solar installations in recent years, policy makers and regulators face the difficult task of deciding when and how these schemes should be amended or phased out. To understand how such actions might shape the role of residential solar and the resulting economics in a changing electricity system, we study how the design of FiR schemes affects optimal PV system sizes. To illustrate our approach, we draw on empirical data on the FIR policies of Net Metering and Feed-in Tariffs from California and Germany between 2005 and 2016. Using a techno-economic model and a conceptual framework, we show that FiR design and its interplay with retail electricity prices and PV system costs jointly determine whether residential PV installations are economic, how they are sized, and which prosumer paradigms they spur. Our analysis holds numerous implications for policy makers and advisors responsible for redesigning or adapting existing FIR mechanisms, as well as for the stakeholders of an emerging ecosystem based on residential solar PV.","[Ossenbrink, Jan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, D MTEC, Grp Sustainabil & Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ossenbrink, Jan] Stanford Grad Sch Business, Sustainable Energy Initiat, Stanford, CA USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Stanford University,"Ossenbrink, J (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, D MTEC, Grp Sustainabil & Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",jossenbrink@ethz.ch,,,Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI) [KTI.1155000154],Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI),"I would like to thank (in alphabetical order) Thomas Becker, Catharina R.

Due to limited storage capacity, long-term use of rainwater is only possible in conjunction with groundwater. We show that this only arises if the price of water is higher than the full marginal cost of rainwater harvesting.

It reports results from fieldwork carried out in the City of Tshwane to measure both quantitatively and qualitatively the success of the project's deployment in townships. Although households register average savings of 27% on their monthly electricity bills and off-peak electricity demand has reduced significantly in the area, a variety of problems prevented the project from attaining the desired level of impact. Difficulties encountered include technical faults with the heaters combined with nonavailability of maintenance; a rise in water consumption; lack of community engagement leading to apathy; and dearth of owner training leading to underuse. The gap between inflated estimates and real savings is discussed.

As a result, countries such as Morocco and Yemen have been promoting this technology for farmers and national plans with variable finance and subsidy schemes like in India have been put forward. By focusing on the application of solar photovoltaic (PV) pumping systems in groundwater-fed agriculture, this paper highlights the need to further study the impacts, opportunities and limitations of this technology within the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus. It shows how most policies and projects promoting solar-based groundwater pumping for irrigation through subsidies and other incentives overlook the real financial and economic costs of this solution as well as the availability of water resources and the potential negative impacts on the environment caused by groundwater over-abstraction. There is a need to monitor groundwater abstraction, targeting subsidies and improving the knowledge and monitoring of resource use. Failing to address these issues could lead to further groundwater depletion, which could threaten the sustainability of this technology and dependent livelihoods in the future.","[Closas, Alvar] IWMI, Battaramulla, Sri Lanka; [Rap, Edwin] Houtensepad 25, NL-3523 RZ Utrecht, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Closas, A (通讯作者)，ICARDA, 15J Radwan Ibn Al Tabib,POB 2416, Cairo, Egypt.",a.closas@cgiar.org,,"Closas, Alvar/0000-0002-9110-3480",,,,,48,58,60,3,86,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAY,2017,104.0,,,,,,33,37,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.035,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP7HS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397549500004,0

In this context, NEVs can be seen as a kind of public good, part of whose value cannot be reflected in a market price. This paper estimates the environmental values of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and studies the influencing factors based on a survey conducted in China's four biggest and developed cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Contingent valuation method (CVM) and the ordered Probit model are employed to achieve the objective. The results show that the least average environmental values of a BEV are 30.60 thousand CNY in the four cities. People with higher income, already having private cars, knowing more about BEVs, thinking that BEVs can improve air quality or with higher levels of education are willing to pay more. Therefore, the policymakers should take the positive WTP of consumers for the environmental effects of BEVs into consideration when pricing the BEVs and reconsider the existing subsidies to BEVs.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Tan, Ruipeng] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X; Tan, Ruipeng/0000-0002-9613-4518",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260-Y07200]; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No. 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No. 1260-Y07200), and Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund).

However, there is often a lack of clarity in applied studies as to how indirect effects involving energy use and/or carbon emissions in supply chains of both energy and non-energy goods and services have been calculated. We propose that more transparency for policymakers may be introduced by replacing consideration of what are often referred to as 'indirect rebound' effects with a simple Carbon Saving Multiplier metric. We illustrate using results from a demand-driven input-output model that tracks supply chain activity at national and/or global level. We argue that this captures and conveys the same information on quantity adjustments in energy used in supply chain activity but does so in a manner that is more positive, transparent, understandable and useful for a policy audience. This is achieved by focusing (here via carbon emissions) on the net benefits of changes in different types of energy use at both household and supply chain levels when energy efficiency improves in households.","[Turner, Karen; Katris, Antonios] Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Energy Policy, Int Publ Policy Inst, McCance Bldg 16 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Turner, K (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Energy Policy, Int Publ Policy Inst, McCance Bldg 16 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",karen.tumer@strath.ac.uk,,"Katris, Antonios/0000-0001-9352-2307",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M00760X/1]; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1207166]; EPSRC [EP/M00760X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1207166] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M00760X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (Grant Reference: EP/M00760X/1); and the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (Ph.D. Studentship [ESRC] Reference: 1207166).,,25,4,5,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,APR,2017,103.0,,,,,,249,257,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.057,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NA,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000397356000020,0

Natural amenities and urban agglomeration are measured using the USDA Economic Research Service county classification codes. The general finding is that natural amenities and urban agglomeration both influenced regional growth. Yet, the natural amenity ranking is estimated to be positively related to increased productivity over the period rather than increased attractiveness to households. Urban agglomeration is positively related to increased amenity attractiveness to households. Within census regions, household natural amenity demand played a stronger role in non-metropolitan areas. Resumen Este articulo evalua empiricamente, mediante el uso de un modelo de crecimiento hedonico espacial, el papel de los servicios de recreo de la naturaleza y las economias de aglomeracion urbana en los patrones de crecimiento regional de los Estados Unidos entre 2000 y 2010. Los servicios de recreo de la naturaleza y la aglomeracion urbana se midieron mediante los codigos de clasificacion a nivel de condado del Servicio de Investigacion Economica del USDA. El hallazgo general es que tanto los servicios de recreo de la naturaleza como la aglomeracion urbana influyeron en el crecimiento regional. Sin embargo, se estima que la clasificacion de los servicios de recreo de la naturaleza esta relacionada positivamente con el aumento de la productividad durante el periodo en cuestion, en lugar de aumentar el atractivo para los hogares. La aglomeracion urbana esta relacionada positivamente con el aumento del atractivo de los servicios a los hogares. Dentro de las regiones del censo, la demanda familiar de servicios de recreo de la naturaleza jugo un papel mas importante en las areas no metropolitanas. ??: ??????????????????????2000???2010??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????(the USDA Economic Research Service)???????????(county classification code)???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????","[Rickman, Dan S.; Wang, Hongbo] Oklahoma State Univ, Business 338, Stillwater, OK 33874 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Rickman, DS (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Business 338, Stillwater, OK 33874 USA.",dan.rickman@okstate.edu; hongbow@ostatemail.okstate.edu,"Wang, Hongbo/I-5133-2019","Wang, Hongbo/0000-0001-5434-9337; Rickman, Dan/0000-0003-1233-7420",,,,,40,16,19,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The overall results show that energy poverty is widespread in India and the existence of energy poverty also coincides with the other forms of deprivations such as income poverty and social backwardness. For example, Dalits (Lower Caste) and Adivasis (Tribal) are found to be extremely energy poor compared to the other social groups in India. The results also reveal that it is the responsibility of women to manage the domestic chores such as collection of firewood and making of dung cake in traditional Indian households. Inefficient use of such biomass fuels is found to cause health hazards.","[Sadath, Anver C.] Cent Univ Kerala, Sch Econ, Kasaragod, Kerala, India; [Acharya, Rajesh H.] Sch Management, Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Surathkal, Karnataka, India",Central University of Kerala; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka,"Acharya, RH (通讯作者)，Sch Management, Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Surathkal, Karnataka, India.",anver.omanoor@gmail.com; rajeshacharyah@gmail.com,"Acharya, Rajesh/Y-9369-2019; Sadath, Anver C/ABC-9240-2021; Sadath, Anver/AAC-6507-2019","Acharya, Rajesh/0000-0002-9893-0788; Sadath, Anver C/0000-0002-5368-6072;",,,,,39,200,209,19,129,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2017,102.0,,,,,,540,+,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.056,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP4NM,,,Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000397357200051,0

The empirical result indicates that there exist six bubbles during 1986-2016 when the oil price deviate from its intrinsic value based on market fundamentals. Specifically, oil price contains the fundamentals and bubble components. The dates of the bubbles correspond to specific events in the politics and financial markets. The authorities should actively fight speculative bubbles or just observe their evolutions and speculation activities may decrease, which is favour of the stabilisation of the staple commodities including crude oil price.

We compare entrepreneurship between return migrants who used to work in a province other than their home province and migrants whose work experience is limited to within their home province. Migrants who leave their home province lose rooted social networks and immediate support from relatives and friends, but might gain new social networks, human capital and financial capital, which eventually enable them to enter entrepreneurship more easily. The factors tested for their association with entrepreneurship include a range of individual characteristics, human and social capital, financial capital, city fixed effects and industry fixed effects. Significant heterogeneous patterns across regions suggest the active eastern market is more conducive to entrepreneurship than the sluggish western market. Return migrants in the East accumulated more human capital and social capital, have more self-financed fund and are more likely to start a business at the same time.","[Yu, Li] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xundong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiang] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Boston, MA USA; [Li, Wenwei] PricewaterhouseCoopers Consultants, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics; Boston College,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Ctr Human Capital & Labor Market Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuli.isu@gmail.com,"Yu, Li/AAI-9671-2020","Yu, Li/0000-0003-0067-6548; Zheng, Xiang/0000-0002-1880-650X",Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9154034]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403303]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"We gratefully acknowledge the funding support from Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Project No. 9154034), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71403303) and the Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.

This study adds to the literature on the psychological impact of related developments by drawing upon Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and the concept of place attachment. In providing a holistic framework, it examines community residents' appraisals of and emotional responses to impacts of an unconventional gas development, and establishes heterogeneity in these appraisals and responses among residents. The findings show that perceived negative impact on resources that encompass personal and communal resources due to the development contributes to negative emotions that can lead to deteriorated psychological well-being. Conversely, perceived positive impact on resources is conducive to positive emotions that in turn can foster residents' psychological well-being. The findings further reveal that perceived impact on place attachment partially mediates the relationship between perceived impact on resources and negative emotions. Importantly, these effects differ in strength for residents characterized by different ages, lengths of residence, and distances of their properties from the development. Implications for how this framework can be applied to minimize unwanted impacts and be incorporated into social license that goes beyond the current model of community consultation are discussed.","[Lai, Po-Hsin; Lyons, Kevin D.; Gudergan, Siegfried P.; Grimstad, Sidsel] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Lai, PH (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Po-Hsin.Lai@newcastle.edu.au; Kevin.Lyons@newcastle.edu.au; Siggi.Gudergan@newcastle.edu.au; Sidsel.Grimstad@newcastle.edu.au,"Grimstad, Sidsel/O-8524-2019; Gudergan, Siegfried P/GQA-6306-2022; Lai, Po-Hsin/N-2286-2019; Lyons, Kevin/G-7032-2013","Grimstad, Sidsel/0000-0001-5379-2783; Gudergan, Siegfried P/0000-0002-5493-4664; Lyons, Kevin/0000-0003-0456-4869","Faculty of Business and Law, University of Newcastle","Faculty of Business and Law, University of Newcastle","This work was funded by the Faculty of Business and Law, University of Newcastle.

It also presents a method on how to estimate the contribution from the photovoltaic-system on the reduction of the specific energy demand of the building. A challenge with the proposed near zero energy building definition is that it is not clearly defined how it manages photovoltaic electricity as a mean to reduce the specific energy demand of buildings. The results suggest that the building with the ground source heat pump and heat recovery ventilation has the lowest specific energy demand. The proposed definition will give an advantage to system combinations comprised of heat pumps and PV-systems and this will lead to the possibility to build less insulated buildings with higher heat losses than for a building with a non-electrical heating system. A higher share of heat pumps can lead to lower electricity production in Sweden because of lost heating loads in district heating systems and a higher electricity demand.,"[Thygesen, Richard; Karlsson, Bjorn] Malardalen Univ, Sch Business Soc & Engn, Box 883, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden",Malardalen University,"Thygesen, R (通讯作者)，Malardalen Univ, Sch Business Soc & Engn, Box 883, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden.",richard.thygesen@mdh.se,"Karlsson, Bjorn/JMB-6699-2023","Karlsson, Bjorn/0000-0002-8435-6463",Swedish Energy Agency [37586-1],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency),This work is funded by the Swedish Energy Agency (Grant no. 37586-1).,,30,24,24,3,36,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,101.0,,,,,,10,19,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.025,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392768800002,0

It highlights some differences in the applied tax depreciation method in both countries and then it compares the all depreciation mechanism of assets on selected practical examples. The depreciation or an amortization are the most common way in which the costs associated with the procurement of tangible and intangible assets; it can be transferred to tax costs or accounting costs. Tax depreciations belong among the most effective ways of tax optimization. Tax depreciations are taxable as an expense for achieving, securing and maintaining income that is related to business activity and affects the tax base from which is calculated the income tax subsequently. The purpose of accounting depreciation is to capture the actual loss of long-term property that is caused by its abrasion. A gradual transfer of property value into tax expenditures will affect significantly the amount of the basic tax during several tax periods, thus affecting the level of state revenues. Regards on the significant economic role of depreciation, are created a precise rules for govern depreciation.

The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, which is one of the seven Europe 2020 flagship initiatives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, is also illustrated by the importance of European poverty. Although European poverty is only relative and cannot be compared to the poverty of the global format, it can be seen as a brake on social development with the consequences of social exclusion of individuals. The imaginary scissors among the rich and the poor are constantly opening up. There are many indicators of poverty measurement, one way of assessing income levels in relation to average income in a given country. People who receive income below this threshold are considered socially necessary. Another option is measurement through revenue and consumption.

Regional Studies. Regional economic development has been long conceptualized as a non-linear, interactive and socially embedded process: these features were traditionally regarded as spatially mediated and highly localized. However, unprecedentedly fast technological change coupled with the intensification of global economic integration has spurred the need to place regional development in a truly open and interdependent framework. Despite substantial progress in the academic literature, rethinking regional development in this perspective still presents a number of challenges in terms of concepts, empirical evidence and policy approaches. Following an interdisciplinary assessment of how openness and connectivity - proxied by one of the many cross-border flows, i.e., global investments - interact with regional economic development trajectories, this paper presents a picture of the geography of foreign investments from and to the European regions and its change after the financial and economic crisis in 2008. This simple exercise sheds some initial light on how the operationalization of regional connectivity can improve one's empirical understanding of the evolution of regional economies and the policy approach needed to support their reaction to change.","[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Iammarino, Simona] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Iammarino, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk; s.iammarino@lse.ac.uk,"Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014","Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700","Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [ES/M008436/1]; European Research Council under the European Union [639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1, ES/M008436/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1, ES/M008436/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe; European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research leading to these results received funding from the Economic and Social Research Council/Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe [grant agreement number ES/M008436/1], and from the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme [grant agreement number 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG].",,99,64,68,1,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Disinterest of Slovak companies in working conditions of employees have a negative impact on the costs of companies, employees performance and, in the long run, also on the corporate culture and reputation in the labour market. By identifying and satisfying employees needs, Slovak companies can create a competitive advantage over their competitors. The main aim of the paper is to create the employee satisfaction assessment methodology which can be used in the conditions of Slovak companies. The aim will be fulfilled by the analysis and application of the marketing mix tools used by Slovak companies in the field of HRM. Such methodology can serve as an important tool for companies interested in satisfying the needs of their employees. By assessing the factors in a matrix of importance and satisfaction, companies will be able to identify and address the factors that are important to their employees and, at the moment, dissatisfied them.","[Gogolova, Martina] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Matusova, Dominika] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-4, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Gogolova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",martina.gogolova@fpedas.uniza.sk; dominika.matusova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Gogolova, Martina/O-5769-2015; Matušová, Dominika/A-6735-2016",,project VEGA [1/0244/16],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0244/16 Personnel marketing as a new approach of the ensuring and maintaining the skilled workforce in Slovak companies.,,25,0,0,1,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,526,532,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059201003,0

The current world economy creates a globally closed and heterogeneously structured social and economic system. The economic benefit of globalization is also reflected in the fact that total labour productivity is growing faster when commodities are produced in countries, by production of which they have a comparative advantage, resulting in a faster growth of the life standard. The social dimension of globalization creates more attractive job opportunity and working conditions, affecting income and social welfare in the society. The primary need for a globalized labour market is an increase of labour force flexibility as well as creation of jobs that depend on appropriately interconnected markets where competition and consumers stimulate their entrepreneurial activities. There are several obstacles in the global market that need to be eliminated, such as unemployment, which is the accompanying phenomenon and the threat of the current global economies. It affects the economic performance and the quality of life in the country. A major problem in Slovakia is disproportion between the interconnection of labour market needs and the quality and structure of branches in education system, the low ability of the economy to support job creation, resulting in high unemployment of young generation.

Regional Studies. China's bureaucratic wage determination system is gradually being replaced by a market-based system, leading to a novel version of a dual labour market. This paper studies wage flexibility in this dual market. Its principal findings are as follows: wages in both sectors have become less responsive to changes in official registered unemployment, with an alternative market-based measure of unemployment becoming more relevant; there is evidence of convergence of flexibility between the two sectors; the wages of women exhibit greater flexibility than those of men; and there is evidence of differences in wage flexibility between workers who have urban residential rights and rural migrants.","[Kang, Lili] Shanghai Finance Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Human Resource Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Peng, Fei] Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ & Trade, Dept Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Peng, Fei] Birmingham Business Sch, Ctr Res Econ & Workplace CREW, Dept Business & Labour Econ, Univ House, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; University of Birmingham,"Peng, F (通讯作者)，Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ & Trade, Dept Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Peng, F (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, Ctr Res Econ & Workplace CREW, Dept Business & Labour Econ, Univ House, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",lilikang@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; pengfei@lixin.edu.cn,"康, 丽丽/AAC-9220-2021; Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019","Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Kang, Lili/0000-0002-4726-050X",National Social Science Fund of China [14BJL028]; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [QD2015049]; Shanghai Dawn Scholar [15SG53],National Social Science Fund of China; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)); Shanghai Dawn Scholar,"Financial aids from the National Social Science Fund of China [grant number 14BJL028], the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [grant number QD2015049] and the Shanghai Dawn Scholar [grant number 15SG53] are acknowledged.",,56,2,2,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We develop a modelling approach in which we use CV and CE choice data in one model. The value function obtained shows that people attach value to the presence of natural areas, and that these values vary due to differences in the magnitude of areas, in distance to areas, and differences in accessibility and fragmentation of natural areas. We discuss how the value function can be used to incorporate potential substitution between natural areas. We also show that for approximately one-fifth of our sample there is no added value having any kind of natural area nearby and that people living in small municipalities tend to be indifferent between accessible and inaccessible areas. Our approach produces a generic marginal value function, which may be used to inform cost-benefit analyses and land use planning decisions that wish to incorporate positive and negative welfare externalities related to changes in the provision of natural areas. However, we also show that applying this value function to the regional or local scale may produce biased value estimates.","[Koetse, Mark J.; Brander, Luke M.] Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Verhoef, Erik T.] Vrije Univ, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Verhoef, Erik T.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Brander, Luke M.] Brander Environm Econ, 2408 Block F,9-11 Hong Shing St, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Koetse, MJ (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",mark.koetse@vu.nl; e.t.verhoef@vu.nl; l.m.brander@vu.nl,"Verhoef, Erik/C-4026-2017; Koetse, Mark/K-9483-2013","Verhoef, Erik/0000-0002-0850-5826; Koetse, Mark/0000-0002-9066-8500; Brander, Luke/0000-0002-5862-4030",programme 'Reinventing Landscape Planning in MetroLand' - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); ERA-Net BiodivERsA programme; NWO,programme 'Reinventing Landscape Planning in MetroLand' - Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); ERA-Net BiodivERsA programme; NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This study was supported through the programme 'Reinventing Landscape Planning in MetroLand,' funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), and from the ERA-Net BiodivERsA programme, with the national funder NWO, part of the 2011 BiodivERsA call for research proposals.

There are various methods of its qualitative or quantitative evaluation but scientists are still very cautious about creation of definitive ranking of bankruptcy law quality. It is because such a ranking could evoke that some laws are definite and unique patterns for improving effectiveness of other law regimes. But such a state is according to market practice undesirable. The reason is that these evaluations of bankruptcy law quality are mostly influenced by subjective attitudes of their creators who want to modify position of countries in rankings of quality of bankruptcy law. So, it is vital to define what is real quality of bankruptcy law and how to propose objective method for its evaluation as well as to formulate framework strategies for bankruptcy law. To do that, we analysed the data from World Bank 2016 Doing Business Report and we used standard methods of formal logic at the sample of EU countries. We found out that quality of insolvency law consists of ability to enforce contracts and ability to accomplish contractual duties. When applying this, we state that only Denmark, Finland, Germany and Sweden can be signed as quality insolvency law. We also identified one group of countries which should preventively checked the quality of their insolvency law and other group of countries which should imperatively checked this quality.","[Kovacova, Maria; Kliestikova, Jana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kovacova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",maria.kovacova@fpedas.uniza.sk; jana.kliestikova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Majerova, Jana/N-8126-2015; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015",,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This paper is an output of the project APVV-14-0841: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies in the frame of the program of Slovak Research and Development Agency.,,27,0,0,1,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1104,1111,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059202009,0

Moreover, both of them entered the European Union in the same year and both of them are members of Visegrad Four, but despite these similarities there exists one significant difference in modern history of these countries. Slovakia has been using Euro as currency since 2009, while in the Czech Republic is still used Czech crown. Foreign trade plays important role in the economy of every country, especially in modern globalized world; it solves the proportionality problem, builds the demonstrative effect, but most of all, it supports economic development (in theoretical point of view, foreign trade is part of the Gross Domestic Product formula). This article deals with selected topics of foreign trade in both analysed countries, namely in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The aim of the article is to compare the development of foreign trade in the country with Euro and without Euro. Special attention is paid on the situation in the Czech Republic, where Czech National Bank intervened on the exchange rate between the Czech crown and Euro for several months with the aim to support the export of the Czech Republic. Despite these interventions, the development of the export of the Czech Republic is not stable, as well as the development of the export of Slovakia.

Regional Studies. There are theoretical arguments supporting the view that regional income inequalities, the degree of fiscal decentralization and the quality of government are simultaneously determined. This article argues that existing empirical work has failed to deal adequately with this possibility. In light of this, it applies a simultaneous equation model, which accounts for the joint determination of these three variables, to a panel of 23 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The empirical evidence that emerges from the analysis suggests that a process of fiscal decentralization, accompanied by measures to improve the quality of government, would be an effective strategy for reducing regional inequalities.","[Kyriacou, Andreas P.] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Campus Montilivi, E-17071 Girona, Spain; [Muinelo-Gallo, Leonel] Univ Republica, Inst Econ, Joaquin Requena 1375,Codigo Postal 11200, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay; [Roca-Sagales, Oriol] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ Aplicada, Edifici B, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Universitat de Girona; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Autonomous University of Barcelona","Kyriacou, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Campus Montilivi, E-17071 Girona, Spain.",andreas.kyriacou@udg.edu; lmuinelo@iecon.ccee.edu.uy; oriol.roca@uab.cat,"Kyriacou, Andreas/G-8973-2015; roca-sagales, oriol/K-6415-2017","Kyriacou, Andreas/0000-0001-9571-2833; Muinelo-Gallo, Leonel/0000-0001-9215-5381; roca-sagales, oriol/0000-0002-5401-442X","Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Madrid); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad - Spain [ECO2012-31081]; Direccio General de Recerca Spain [2014 SGR 239, XREPP]; project 'Calidad de gobierno, gasto publico social y financiamiento: impacto en la trayectoria de crecimiento economico de paises de America Latina' of the Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica - Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Madrid); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad - Spain(Spanish Government); Direccio General de Recerca Spain; project 'Calidad de gobierno, gasto publico social y financiamiento: impacto en la trayectoria de crecimiento economico de paises de America Latina' of the Comision Sectorial de Investigacion Cientifica - Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","The authors acknowledge the financial assistance from the Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (Madrid).

Regional Studies. This paper examines how adaptation is interpreted across different UK city-regions by governance and policy actors, finding that the discourse of adaptation is giving way to resilience. This is explained by the value of resilience as a discursive construct in mobilizing and coordinating policy actions. Resilience has greater appeal as a framing device over adaptation to such actors given its potential to enable buy-in from a wider city-regional governance network. However, this paper also highlights the 'resilience trap': the dangers of adopting short-term strategies, re-badging existing strategies and widening governance networks that obfuscate sub-national mobilization around adaptation. It then reflects on how governance actors may act to avoid the resilience trap.","[Kythreotis, Andrew P.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kythreotis, Andrew P.; Bristow, Gillian I.] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kythreotis, Andrew P.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Zuckerman Inst Connect Environm Res, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England",Cardiff University; Cardiff University; University of East Anglia,"Kythreotis, AP (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Kythreotis, AP (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Kythreotis, AP (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Zuckerman Inst Connect Environm Res, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",kythreotisa@cardiff.ac.uk; bristowg1@cardiff.ac.uk,"Bristow, Gillian/M-6122-2015; Kythreotis, Andrew P/F-3748-2011","Kythreotis, Andrew/0000-0002-9436-8185",Regional Studies Association,Regional Studies Association,Special thanks go to the Regional Studies Association for funding this research under an RSA Early Career Grant held by the first author.,,82,32,34,3,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Analytical approaches to solve the underlying state-space model under stochastic evolution and discrete-event simulation are both discussed. The basic assumption is that a set of regeneration points corresponds to skill achievement through learning. A Simulation-based Optimization (SO) tool ranging from the inner level modeling of the cooperation-based learning process to the outer assignment of analysts to assets is then presented.

Providing these parameters is mainly supplier's responsibility. However, it turns out that the electricity quality indicators provided by the supplier are significantly affected by the consumers themselves. In the past, large industrial plants caused the biggest disruptions in the power system. Particularly steelworks with electric arc furnaces and with unit power of up to dozens MW generated disturbances experienced by many consumers of electricity. Interference in the power grid generated by the furnace had a direct impact on man through the light sources. In recent years the nature of used receivers has changed significantly, especially those used by individual consumers. For example, a whole range of modern electronic devices has appeared in households. Recently LED technology has gained popularity. The following article is continuation of the issues related to power security and electricity quality presented at the 16th International Scientific Conference on Globalization and Its Socio-Economic Consequences. This article will present the impact of large industrial customers on energy quality. It will try to trace the direct influence to the human organism caused by interference generated to the power grid by receivers installed in the steelworks. Another issue will be addressing the problem of global littering of the power grid by individual consumer.","[Olczykowski, Zbigniew] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Olczykowski, Z (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",z.olczykowski@uthrad.pl,,"Olczykowski, Zbigniew/0000-0003-4870-2485",,,,,14,2,2,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1811,1818,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203030,0

Globalization is understood as an irreversible process that affects all spheres of the society life and influences various areas of tourism such as economic, technological or ecological. Particularly the current global threat, such as the migration crisis, terrorism, attacks, related increasing crime together with media and the internet influence the tourism market. Therefore, globalization has an impact on the tourism industry, both on supply and demand sides. Due to globalization factors tourists change their destination requirements with the feeling of safety being one of the deciding factors. This is the reason for businesses offering tourism services' respond to the changing demand. Firstly, the article focuses on the analysis of the impacts of globalization on the development of secondary supply in the Czech Republic. This means attendance of tourist facilities and a range of services that have allowed visitors to stay at the destination for the last 10 years. The dynamics of globalization have an impact on the tourism customers by offering them the possibility to choose the country and the manner of spending their holiday. The following is an analysis of the impact of globalization on the development of tourism demand in the Czech Republic over the monitored period. The outcome of this analysis is a change in customer behaviour about the ratio of domestic and outbound tourism. The anticipated development of supply and demand in tourism in the Czech economy is captured by their prediction.","[Pellesova, Pavlina] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 7740, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Pellesova, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 7740, Czech Republic.",pellesova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,1911,1918,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059203043,0

Its essential characteristic is the unlimited need for competencies and non-routine know-how. Because of globalization and building knowledge-based economies, developed countries turn to a global supply of human capital and adjust their migration policy in terms of adapting their legislation so as to facilitate the recruitment of qualified foreign workers. Permanent emigration of qualified workers from developing countries to economically advanced countries may have a number of negative impacts. In economically advanced countries, emigration can lead to a decline in the supply of skilled domestic workers, as well as a decline in their governments' motivation to finance the education of their residents. In developing countries, the biggest negative of the emigration of their highly qualified workers is reflected in brain drain and the consequent negative impact on economic growth. A possible solution to prevent this negative impact is changes in the migration policy of economically advanced countries. One of them could be stimulating circulating migration. Brain circulation allows workers from poor countries to gain some competencies during their stay in rich countries, which they can use after returning to their country of origin. Remittances, which enable to reduce poverty and accumulate capital in developing countries, also play a significant role. At the moment, there is also a need to consider in the field of migration policy about potential opportunities for joint international governance of this phenomenon. In the current situation, a non-cooperative balance is characteristic. This is stable, despite being ineffective.","[Rievajova, Eva; Privara, Andrej] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Social Dev, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Privara, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Social Dev, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; andy.privara@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2175,2182,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204011,0

On the other hand, in the Czech Republic, for example, some subtropical crops can now be grown successfully. The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of global climate change on the structure of fruit market in the Czech Republic, focusing on apples as the major crop of Czech orchards. In the Czech Republic, apples are the most popular kind of fruit and the main source of vitamins for consumers. Nowadays, apples make up about 80% of the Czech fruit production. Apples grown in the Czech Republic are perfectly adapted to the local temperate climate, which has sufficient precipitation, and therefore they ripen under optimum conditions. The method of elaboration of this paper is based on the description of the composition of the fruit crops grown in the Czech Republic. The analysis monitors the developments in the harvests of the major crop (apples) between 2006 and 2014. Imports of apples and changes in the structure of fruit crops grown in the Czech Republic are studied in terms of global warming in the form of comparative analysis. Using a particular example, the study examines the difference between the quality of imported fruit and the domestic crops in terms of chemical residue content, in particular concerning pesticides.","[Severova, Lucie; Svoboda, Roman] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Svoboda, R (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",severova@pef.czu.cz; svobodar@pef.czu.cz,"Severová, Lucie/J-2548-2017; Svoboda, Roman/G-3320-2017",,"Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [20171011]","Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague","This research project is supported by Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, grant number 20171011 -Application of HelpmanKrugman model for international exchange in market with food products.",,18,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2324,2331,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059204030,0

Particularly in healthcare organizations, social maturity is still a more competitive advantage in today's globalized environment. The main aim of the paper is to present the classification of the social maturity pillar within the framework of holistic management and to emphasize the importance of social maturity in healthcare organizations. To do this, a survey was carried out by 176 healthcare professionals from various healthcare organizations. The results of the research will be divided according to the internal division, namely on character, will, cognitive and creative qualities, temperament, emotional, somatic-bodily and somatic-mental properties. These eight components of social maturity will be ranked according to importance. Research results indicate the main areas for further development of social maturity in health organizations. The author assumes the importance of the pillar as a key element of the competitiveness of healthcare organizations in a globalized world. It will be necessary to specify these identified areas for staffing of interpersonal, information, decision and administrative roles. The results of the research will be formulated in such a way as to respect the basic rules of management functions, namely efficiency, effectiveness, economy and equity.","[Vydrova, Janka] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Vydrová, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin, Czech Republic.",jvydrova@fame.utb.cz,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-212-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,2966,2973,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0WP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000685059205046,0

Several studies have found that in this mixed economy, the private sector is economically more efficient than the state-owned sector. In this paper, we investigate whether private firms are also more carbon efficient than state-owned firms. Using a macroeconomic panel data model with provincial data from 1992 to 2010, we confirm that private firms emit less carbon dioxide than state-owned firms. Our results imply that future reforms, such as ongoing privatization, introduced to increase the economic efficiency of state-owned companies will also mitigate emissions growth. The policy lesson, not only for China but for developing countries maintaining a large state-owned sector, is that economic efficiency and energy efficiency are conjoined mutual benefits.","[Andersson, Fredrik N.

To reach this carbon emission goal by 2050, this paper examines three potential policy options (each accompanied with four illustrative scenarios). The results show that: (1) it is impossible to reach the goals of the GGRMA solely through the use of carbon allowance allocations and the use of alternative fuels if the use of vehicles is allowed to grow. (2) By keeping the increase in the use of vehicles to zero, by encouraging a use of PHEVs, and by implementing a carbon allowance allocation, it will be possible to reach the government's 2050 carbon emissions goals. (3) If the use of vehicles can actually be reduced, it will be possible to achieve carbon emissions which are lower than the 2050 targets by 1.30-5.18%. The use of alternative fuels proves to be a reliable way to decrease carbon emission. Carbon emissions could also be lowered by encouraging the use of public transportation.","[Chang, Ching-Chih; Chung, Chia-Ling] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Transportat & Commun Management Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Chang, Ching-Chih] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Res Ctr Energy Technol & Strategy, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University,"Chang, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Transportat & Commun Management Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;Chang, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Res Ctr Energy Technol & Strategy, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",chan5305@mail.ncku.edu.tw; irene_0929@livemail.tw,,"Chang, Ching Chih/0000-0003-2579-3839","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-006-053-MY2, MOST 107-2410-H-006-076]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors acknowledge the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, for providing partial funding to support this study under contract number MOST 105-2410-H-006-053-MY2 and MOST 107-2410-H-006-076.",,21,11,11,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,299,307,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.068,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700030,0

This 70 MW project covers more than 63 ha of the flooded area and can provide electricity for 21,000 homes. It also demonstrates China's ambition to amend its fragile environmental status namely air pollution, which claims 1.6 million lives every year. Soon after the completion, many countries expressed interest in building similar power stations, and within few months some companies released innovative products tailored specifically for improving the efficiency of floating solar power plants. China has a unique capacity to implement new ideas, scale them up and commercialise efficiently and now its self-declared war on pollution in 2014 seems to be reshaping the world energy landscape. China's plan to build 1 GW floating solar farms on abandoned coal mines present a stark contrast to the current environmental policies of the government of the United States. The innovative thinking behind these projects suggests that not only this country is taking the lead in renewable energies, but it is moving beyond speed, efficiency and mass production, and becoming a hub for innovation in green energy technologies.","[Pouran, Hamid M.] Univ Wolverhampton, Wulfruna St, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England",University of Wolverhampton,"Pouran, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Wolverhampton, Wulfruna St, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England.",h.pouran@wlv.ac.uk,"Pouran, Hamid M/F-8904-2015","Pouran, Hamid M/0000-0001-5233-0085",,,,,31,39,41,3,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2018,123.0,,,,,,414,420,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.09.010,0.0,,,7,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HE6FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453499700041,0

In most countries, however, ESS market share is small and whether or not the technology will attain a critical market share is subject to homeowners' investment decisions. For policy and industry alike, it is of particular interest to identify factors that drive ESS adoption. Empirically addressing this question, we hypothesized that the factors autarky and autonomy aspirations crucially determine ESS adoption decisions. In two studies (N-total = 489), sketching future decentralized energy scenarios, we found evidence for the importance of both factors for homeowners' evaluations of the technology. However, only autarky significantly affected homeowners' willingness to pay extra for ESS, in that homeowners invested more in the technology when autarky was higher (Study 1) or autarky benefits were emphasized (Study 2). In accordance with concepts aspiring to optimize energy flow on the low-voltage grid level (e.g. Smart Neighborhoods), we additionally examined the influence of autarky and autonomy aspirations on homeowners' willingness to exchange self-generated energy within a local energy network. Results showed that emphasis on autarky increased the subjective value of self-generated energy, decreasing the likelihood of peer-to-peer energy trading.","[Ecker, Franz; Spada, Hans] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Cognit Act & Sustainabil Unit, Dept Psychol, Freiburg, Germany; [Hahnel, Ulf J.

Too often as identified in the research, energy taxation policy is developed in isolation and a more holistic perspective is needed which incorporates the entire tax system. A focus on distributive justice as an over-arching energy taxation policy goal is particularly important as a retention of the current status quo will continue to see countries lose the majority of the benefits of their own energy resources to foreign markets and consumers.

The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.

Multiple authors have used this metric to explore the behaviour of the economy over the transition to lower carbon energy sources. The following text is a review of energy-economy models that incorporate the EROEI metric. In particular, the EROEI-dynamics literature is found to describe a common set of dynamics associated with the transition to lower EROEI primary energy resources. These include: the rising resource-cost of primary energy production, the short-term misallocation of resources, the short-term overproduction of energy and the potential decline in economic stability. The literature can be divided into groups of related models. Following the review, a number of key areas for additional work are identified and discussed.","[Rye, Craig D.; Jackson, Tim] Univ Surrey, Ctr Understanding Sustainable Prosper, 388 Stag Hill, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Rye, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Ctr Understanding Sustainable Prosper, 388 Stag Hill, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",craig.d.rye@gmail.com,"Rye, Craig/AAU-7772-2021",,Economic and Social Research Council for the Centre for the Understanding of Sustanable Prosperity (ESRC) [ES/M010163/1]; Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP.ac.uk); ESRC [ES/M010163/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council for the Centre for the Understanding of Sustanable Prosperity (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP.ac.uk); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The financial support of the Economic and Social Research Council for the Centre for the Understanding of Sustanable Prosperity (ESRC grant no: ES/M010163/1) is gratefully acknowledged.

We examine the extent to which induced traffic and travel can partly erode the benefit of emission reduction arising from capacity expansion, and compare the results with corresponding values for user benefits. We then consider the effect on emission profiles over time of congestion charging which attempts to reduce travel demand in the peak period. Using a simplified partial equilibrium simulation model over a twenty five year period we contrast the situations in developed and developing countries where the emission profiles may take very distinct forms. We show that, due to the alignment of 'volume effects and 'speed' effects, the benefit of emission reduction associated with capacity expansion policies may be severely compromised by induced traffic, and exceeds that of user benefits. We confirm that demand management policies which internalise the costs of congestion can be effective in containing or reducing emissions over the simulation period, and in ameliorating the effects of induced traffic that accompany capacity expansion. We establish multiplier relationships between the reduction of emissions and the quantity of demand priced off or otherwise restrained from use of a road, and examine for different traffic growth rates the implication for effectiveness of demand-based policies.","[Lee, Shin] Univ Seoul, Int Sch Urban Sci, Seoul, South Korea",University of Seoul,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Humanities Bldg 5224,163 Seoulsiripdaero, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",shinlee714@uos.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,9,10,3,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,264,274,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.035,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800027,0

However, as the initial costs for these alternative systems are around eight times more than those for conventional fixed speed systems, a comprehensive feasibility analysis should be conducted. Previous analyses focused on economic benefits based on predetermined loads for ventilation. As such, the various social benefits that are dynamically determined according to energy saving resulting from variable speed operation could not be determined. This research presents a probabilistic social cost-benefit analysis model. The ventilation systems' operational loads are mainly affected by particulate matter concentrations; these can be predicted through probabilistic simulation of previous weather data. The probabilistically analyzed energy saving influences the social benefits i.e. fuel reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and air pollutant reduction. The proposed analysis model is validated with real world data obtained from the operation of underground subway station ventilation systems in which synchronous reluctance motors (SynRM), a type of high efficiency variable speed motor, and inverters are installed by the authors.","[Quan, Junlong; Kim, Se-Heon] Hanyang Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 611-2 Engn Sci & Technol B-D,222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Kim, Ju-Hyung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 611-1 Engn Sci & Technol B-D,222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, 611-1 Engn Sci & Technol B-D,222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",Junryong1122@nate.com; noname-0001@hanmail.net; Kcr97jhk@hanyang.ac.kr,"Kim, Ju Hyung/E-9065-2013","Kim, Ju-Hyung/0000-0001-5078-4796","Railroad Technology Research Program grant - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Korean government [16RTRP-B067916-04]","Railroad Technology Research Program grant - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Korean government","This research was supported by the Railroad Technology Research Program grant (16RTRP-B067916-04) funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of the Korean government.",,24,9,10,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121.0,,,,,,92,100,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.007,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445983800010,0

We used three scenarios to estimate China's Peak uranium. And the results are quite robust. According to Scenario 3, the Hubbert Peak uranium production is expected to be reached in 2065 with 4605 t per year. Before the peak, China's uranium demand will grow at the rate of about 7.69% per year, which is about three times the growth rate of production. China's uranium import dependence is estimated to continue to increase. In order to improve uranium resources security, the Chinese government needs to increase investment in uranium ore exploration, encourage private sector's investment in uranium production to promote competition, and improve cooperation with non-uranium mining enterprises for more efficient use of resources. To enhance the country's uranium security, China should establish development funds, accelerate acquisition of uranium enterprises abroad, increase R&D in the unconventional uranium resources such as phosphate mine, and take advantage of price downturn in uranium market to increase strategic reserves.","[Fang, Jianchun] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Fang, Jianchun] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Accountancy Finance & Econ, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Lu, Zhou] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wanshan] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of Huddersfield; Tianjin University of Commerce; Zhejiang University,"Wu, WS (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fangjch@cass.org.cn; c.lau@hud.ac.uk; luzhou59@gmail.com; wuwanshan@zju.edu.cn,"Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019","Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; fang, jianchun/0000-0003-0142-8730; Wu, Wanshan/0000-0002-2191-8713",National Social Science Fund of China [16BJY052],National Social Science Fund of China,"We thank anonymous reviewers, editors for their helpful comments and advice.

Here, we present a novel comprehensive bottom-up process chain framework that is applied to 19 electricity generation technologies, consistently incorporating 12 life-cycle phases from extraction to decommissioning. For each life-cycle phase of each technology the following 4 key metrics were assessed: material consumption, energy return ratios, job requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. We also calculate a novel global electricity to grid average for these metrics and present a metric variability analysis by altering transport distance, load factors, efficiency, and fuel density per technology. This work quantitatively supports model-to-policy frameworks that drive technology selection and investment based on energetic-economic viability, job creation and carbon emission reduction of technologies. The results suggest energetic-economic infeasibility of electricity generation networks with substantial shares of: i) liquefied natural gas transport, ii) long distance transport based hard and brown coal and pipeline natural gas, and iii) low-load factor solar-photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind.

Scenarios that do or do not comply with the carbon pollution standards based on the U.S. New Source Performance Standards and Clean Power Plan are evaluated. Using the Electric Reliability Council of Texas region as an illustration, the scenarios with carbon regulations are shown to have lower CO2 emissions and water use from the power sector than the continuation of the status quo with more electricity generation from coal than natural gas. The benefits are due to increases in electricity generation from renewable sources and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants plus retirements of existing coal-fired plants, which depend on natural gas and CO2 allowance prices. When CO2 is captured and sold for enhanced oil recovery with a price higher than $15 per short ton, water consumption is elevated because of more electricity generation from existing NGCC plants retrofitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. A stringent constraint on water withdrawals decreases electricity generation from existing power plants with once-through cooling, but increases overall water consumption because of an elevated share of plants with wet recirculating cooling systems in the fleet.","[Lim-Wavde, Kustini; Kauffman, Robert J.] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Zhai, Haibo; Rubin, Edward S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Singapore Management University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Zhai, HB (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",hbzhai@cmu.edu,"Zhai, Haibo/L-8201-2019; Rubin, Edward S/D-7629-2013; KAUFFMAN, Robert J/G-2767-2012","Zhai, Haibo/0000-0001-8585-9559; Lim-Wavde, Kustini/0000-0003-0726-3826","Singapore Management University (SMU); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Singapore Management University (SMU); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)","Singapore Management University (SMU)(Singapore Management University); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Singapore Management University (SMU)(Singapore Management University); Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)","This work was supported by the Living Analytics Research Center (LARC), a joint research initiative between Singapore Management University (SMU) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

It discusses the prospects in countries that have never deployed nuclear power before but have expressed an interest in adding it to their future national energy mixes. Many of these newcomer countries are considering small modular reactor (SMR) designs which hold promise for fitting better into their local electricity systems. Thus, the article considers the technical attributes of these designs and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of SMRs with an emphasis on economics, grid compatibility and most importantly, safety. Attributes of a safety culture are discussed from social and cultural aspects, including topics of good governance and the presence of an independent national regulatory authority. Beyond the need for strong national safety regulations, the article also highlights the need to strengthen the international regulatory regime, if nuclear power is to succeed in achieving the highest levels of safety globally.

However, few studies have empirically applied TC analysis to GB incentives, which normally should have analyzed the TCs borne by different stakeholders. These include TC typology and determinants during the implementation process, especially the extra administration process where TCs possibly may be incurred. The lack of such in-depth analysis tends to make incentive-design ignore efficiency and fairness amongst the stakeholders. This study aims to improve the efficiency of GB incentives through analyzing TCs borne by the private sector stakeholders. It would identify TC typologies and determinants, and TCs measurement and allocation to different stakeholders. As TCs are policy context-specific, this paper takes a popular GB incentive scheme, Gross Floor Area (GFA) Concession Scheme, as an example. Interviews were conducted with 20 industry experts to validate TCs types and determinants, and to gauge the magnitude of TCs borne by different stakeholders.

In this paper, we evaluate the effect of these incentives on the adoption of electric vehicles. We find that every $1000 offered as a rebate or tax credit increases average sales of electric vehicles by 2.6%. We also find that HOV lane access is a significant contributor to adoption, the effect is a 4.7% increase corresponding to density of HOV lanes (every 100 vehicles per hour). In addition, we introduce a novel variable to capture consumer knowledge of EVs and associated incentives in our model to help explain the state level heterogeneity in response to incentives and find that raising consumer awareness is critical to the success of EV incentive programs.","[Jenn, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Springel, Katalin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gopal, Anand R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Int Energy Studies Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Jenn, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ajenn@ucdavis.edu,,"Jenn, Alan/0000-0003-4232-0697","Office of International Affairs, U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of International Affairs, U.S. Department of Energy under Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank Jeff Kessler and his work on the consumer knowledge proxy using the Stanford Natural Language Processor.

However, the quantitative research on the potential and economics of smart charging for different types of EVs in China remains insufficient, which has been increasingly regarded as a critical barrier for associated policy decision marking. To address this issue, this paper conducts a survey on the charging behaviors of four types of EVs in Shanghai and evaluates the capacity potential and cost of EV smart charging. A Bass Diffusion model is adopted to forecast the stock growth of EVs and the potential of smart charging is investigated by simulating EV charging behavior under two scenarios. It finds that private and commercial EVs could deliver greater smart charging than that of electric bus and taxis. Business models and charging policies that could cost-effectively explore the potential of EV smart charging are further discussed. The paper concludes that charging service providers with time of use charging tariffs could realize the potential of smart charging in a cost-efficient way.","[Liu Jian; Zhao Yongqiang] NDRC, Energy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hyoungmi, Kim] Nat Resources Def Council, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Liu, J (通讯作者)，NDRC, Energy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuj@eri.org.cn; zhaoyq@eri.org.cn; hkim@ndrc-china.org,,,,,,,33,27,29,5,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,206,+,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.037,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200020,0

These arguments are reassessed in the literature, particularly as to how they apply to supporting demonstration projects for decarbonizing industry. A new data set is built of 511 demonstration projects in nine technology areas and characteristics for each project are coded, including timing, motivations, scale, and the share of public funding. The literature and the results from the case studies have five main implications for policy makers in making decisions about demonstration support.

The study incorporates perspectives of different experts that represent various stakeholders of the Turkish power sector. The study reveals that supply reliability, investment costs and contribution to national economy are perceived as most important factors, whereas waste disposal and decommissioning costs are perceived as least important factors. Considering the overall weights, the most attractive power plant types for the Turkish power market are coal, hydro and natural gas power plants. The study indicates that Turkey should drastically decrease the installed capacity share of traditionally dominant power plants (to 58% from 89% in 2016) and fossil fuel power plants (to 40% from 56% in 2016), and increase the share of renewable power plants (to 52% from 44% in 2016), indigenous resource based power plants (to 67% from 56% in 2016) and nuclear power plants.","[Pasaoglu, Guzay] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Garcia, Nicolas Pardo] Austrian Inst Technol, Donau City Str 1, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; [Zubi, Ghassan] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Elect Engn, Calle Maria de Luna 3, Zaragoza 50018, Spain",Radboud University Nijmegen; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); University of Zaragoza,"Pasaoglu, G (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",guzaypasaoglu@gmail.com,"; Zubi, Ghassan/N-1233-2017","Pardo Garcia, Nicolas/0000-0002-2817-9976; Zubi, Ghassan/0000-0001-6204-5050",,,,,79,12,12,2,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2018,119.0,,,,,,654,665,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.044,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GO0XY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439671200060,0

We analyze this question in the context of Alberta's competitive retail electricity market, using data on the prices and characteristics of both regulated and unregulated retail products from July 2006 to March 2017. Our analysis consists of a descriptive discussion of the evolution of market structure in the industry, followed by an econometric analysis of the effect of default prices on unregulated retail prices. We find that as the default product moved from being a long-term stable product, to one based on short-term forward market prices, the number of products and competitors increased substantially. Our econometric analysis of the pricing of unregulated contracts suggests that competitive retailers adjust prices upward in response to short-term increases in the regulated rate, even after controlling for changes in the costs of providing retail products.","[Brown, David P.; Eckert, Andrew] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Alberta,"Brown, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",dpbrown@ualberta.ca; aeckert@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,55,8,8,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUL,2018,118.0,,,,,,298,311,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.049,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GJ1TF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435050000028,0

Researchers have examined public support/opposition to a wide variety of energy issues, as well as predictors of these preferences. However, researchers have typically excluded the views of those who say they don't know or do not respond to questions about a particular policy, even when they make up a sizable portion of the population. As a result, we know little about those who provide nonsubstantive responses to energy policy questions, as compared to those who provide support/opposition responses. In this article, I examine the roles of issue awareness, risk perception, and socio-demographic characteristics in predicting support, opposition, and not sure responses to three different energy development issues: nuclear power, the Keystone XL pipeline, and hydraulic fracturing. One of the key findings is that the risk perception predictors of nonsubstantive responses more closely resemble the risk perception predictors of opposition rather than the predictors of support. By excluding the policy preferences of those who don't know or do not answer, researchers are likely providing policymakers with estimates that underrepresent the views of those who are more concerned about environmental risk.","[Edwards, Michelle L.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, TCU Box 298710, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Texas Christian University,"Edwards, ML (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, TCU Box 298710, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",m.l.edwards@tcu.edu,,"Edwards, Michelle/0000-0002-6961-4436",,,,,40,16,19,1,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,348,357,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600034,0

The SAM price model identifies the role of energy prices in the cost and price definition processes.

Multi-year simulations of the Greek interconnected power system on an hour-by-hour basis for the forthcoming 10-year study horizon (period 2018-2027) under a set of scenarios regarding the future operating conditions have been performed, providing the key operational data for the calculation of all probabilistic indicators. Test results indicate that the existence of all currently available thermal generating units as well as the timely realization of all scheduled construction plans is of utmost importance for the long-term secure and reliable operation of the Greek interconnected power system. In a more generalized framework, the ambitious EU goals regarding decarbonization and increasing RES shares in electricity generation should be accompanied by detailed studies in order to ensure that no resource adequacy problems will arise in the near future due to the massive withdrawal of conventional base-load and, possibly, flexible generating units.","[Simoglou, Christos K.; Bakirtzis, Emmanouil A.; Biskas, Pandelis N.; Bakirtzis, Anastasios G.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Power Syst Lab, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Simoglou, CK (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Power Syst Lab, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece.",chsimoglou@ee.auth.gr; emmpakir@auth.gr; pbiskas@auth.gr; bakiana@eng.auth.gr,"Bakirtzis, Emmanouil/AGY-2565-2022; Bakirtzis, Anastasios G/C-1529-2010; Simoglou, Christos/HLH-6170-2023","Bakirtzis, Emmanouil/0000-0002-4458-1893; Simoglou, Christos/0000-0002-2363-0094",European Social Fund,European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This work was conducted in the framework of the act Support of Postdoctoral Researchers under the Operational Program Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning, 2014-2020, which is implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation of Greece and co-financed by the European Social Fund and the Greek State.",,31,15,15,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,295,306,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.02.047,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600029,0

Despite the upside potential, there are major challenges facing those who embark on academia-industry collaborations. Although applied researchers in general likely encounter similar challenges, this paper focuses on challenges of energy research collaborations between private industry and social scientists. We frame collaboration as an inherently social process, whereby a project is developed and proceeds, with errors made and successes achieved, within the context of social relationships. We argue that social breakdowns and different institutional values underlie most collaboration challenges, and that these issues need to be recognised and addressed to increase the chances of successful collaboration. We provide recommendations for improving industry-social science collaborations in energy research, concluding that like any other social relationship, given proper communication, agreed upon expectations, and shared values, industry and academia can make a perfect pair.","[Sintov, Nicole D.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Schuitema, Geertje] UCD Sch Business, Carysfort Ave, Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland; [Schuitema, Geertje] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Energy Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University College Dublin,"Sintov, ND (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",sintov.2@osu.edu; geertje.schuitema@ucd.ie,"Schuitema, Geertje/AAT-6964-2021; Schuitema, Geertje/IAQ-2220-2023","Schuitema, Geertje/0000-0002-3286-5426;",,,,,39,9,9,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2018,117.0,,,,,,247,251,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.021,0.0,,,5,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GF4KU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431932600024,0

The importance of quantifying minimum generation levels for renewable integration,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewable integration; Electricity planning; Grid modeling; Grid flexibility,,"One of the significant limitations of solar and wind deployment is declining value caused by the limited correlation of renewable energy supply and electricity demand as well as limited flexibility of the power system. Limited flexibility can result from thermal and hydro plants that cannot turn off or reduce output due to technical or economic limits. These limits include the operating range of conventional thermal power plants, the need for process heat from combined heat and power plants, and restrictions on hydro unit operation. To appropriately analyze regional and national energy policies related to renewable deployment, these limits must be accurately captured in grid planning models. In this work, we summarize data sources and methods for U.S. power plants that can be used to capture minimum generation levels in grid planning tools, such as production cost models. We also provide case studies for two locations in the U.S. (California and Texas) that demonstrate the sensitivity of variable generation (VG) curtailment to grid flexibility assumptions which shows the importance of analyzing (and documenting) minimum generation levels in studies of increased VG penetration.","[Denholm, Paul; Brinkman, Greg; Mai, Trieu] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Denholm, P (通讯作者)，Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver West Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",Paul.denholm@nrel.gov; gregory.brinkman@nrel.gov; trieu.mai@nrel.gov,,,U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [DE-AC36-08GO28308],U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The authors thank Michael Rossol and Rajaraman Padmanabhan for assistance with CEMS data.

This study examines collective decision making in water resource management during droughts. By focusing on the drought response by groups of water users in river basin communities in Japan, we investigate the determinants of collective decisions on water withdrawal restrictions. Our results show that water user groups are more willing to cooperate for water conservation when other water user groups in a community also cooperate. This suggests that the level of cooperation in drought management depends on other water user groups' cooperation. The findings contribute to a better understanding of collective action in water management, which is also informative to improve adaptive capacity to climate change.","[Tembata, Kaori; Takeuchi, Kenji] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Tembata, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kaoritembata@gmail.com; takeuchi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Takeuchi, Kenji/S-5311-2016; Takeuchi, Kenji/GWV-8019-2022","Takeuchi, Kenji/0000-0002-6180-7663","JSPS KAKENHI [17K18564]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K18565, 17K18564] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their careful review and valuable comments.

The paper compares a number of alternative explanations put forward in the public debate after the referendum. The empirical analysis suggests that the outcome of the referendum can be linked to an increasing tension between the ever increasing internationalization of local firms and the localistic' attitude of their employees. Brexit can be seen as the result of a process of split Europeanization' whereby Euroscepticism is triggered by the increasing mismatch between internationalized economies (and corporate economic interests) and localistic societies (and workers' attitudes and cultural preferences).,"[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Di Cataldo, Marco] London Sch Econ, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Faggian, Alessandra] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Social Sci, Laquila, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI),"Crescenzi, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk,"Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014; Faggian, Alessandra/K-8548-2019; Di Cataldo, Marco/AAK-8373-2020","Faggian, Alessandra/0000-0002-2479-2933; Di Cataldo, Marco/0000-0002-2808-1776",European Research Council [639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG",,40,26,28,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

At the same time, increasing electricity access can have notable consequences for global climate change. This paper analyses trade-offs and synergies between achieving universal electricity access and climate change mitigation in Sub-Saharan Africa, using the IMAGE-TIMER integrated assessment model. For this purpose, we analysed developments in a number of indicators that describe demand, production, and costs of the future power system under various scenarios with and without climate change mitigation policies. The results show that, achieving universal electricity access requires an annual investment of USD 27-33 billion until 2030 on top of baseline investment. There is a strong synergy in emissions reduction and investment savings, particularly driven by the regions' efficiency improvements of household appliances (the purchase of efficient appliances and the efficient use of the appliances). On the other hand, climate mitigation policies are projected to increase the cost of electricity per kWh, depending on fossil fuel share in the mix. Therefore, we conclude that, climate policies will need to be combined with complementary policies- e.g. pro-poor tariffs, fuel subsidies, and cross subsidization- to protect the poor from increasing electricity prices.","[Dagnachew, Anteneh G.; Lucas, Paul L.; Hof, Andries F.; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Hof, Andries F.; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Dagnachew, AG (通讯作者)，PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands.",Anteneh.dagnachew@pbl.nl,"Hof, Andries/AFB-4199-2022; van Vuuren, Detlef/A-4764-2009","Hof, Andries/0000-0002-7568-5038; van Vuuren, Detlef/0000-0003-0398-2831; Lucas, Paul/0000-0003-0292-7830; Dagnachew, Anteneh Getnet/0000-0002-6217-9726","Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its Directorate-General of Trade and International Cooperation; European Horizon Research Programme as part of the CD-LINKS project (Linking Climate and Development Policies-Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing) [642147]","Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its Directorate-General of Trade and International Cooperation; European Horizon Research Programme as part of the CD-LINKS project (Linking Climate and Development Policies-Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing)","The research presented in this paper was funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its Directorate-General of Trade and International Cooperation.

Inspired by the literature on Item Response Theory and multilevel latent models, the TLRI model treats policy commitment as a latent variable which is estimated conditional on the difficulty of the policy portfolio implemented by each country. This approach is characterized by three novel aspects. First, the model results in a ranking of countries which is conditional on the complexity of their chosen policy portfolio. Second, it provides a unified framework in which to construct a policy indicator and to study its determinants through a latent regression approach. The resulting country ranking can thus be cleaned from the effect of economic and institutional observables which affect policy design and implementation. Third, the model estimates parameters which can be used to describe and compare policy portfolios across countries. We apply this methodology to the case of energy efficiency policies in the industrial sectors of 29 EU countries between 2004 and 2011. In the conclusions we highlight the future possible applications of this approach, which are not confined to the realm of environmental and energy policy.","[Galeotti, Marzio; Salini, Silvia] Univ Milan, DESP, Milan, Italy; [Galeotti, Marzio] Univ Bocconi, IEFE, Milan, Italy; [Rubashkina, Yana] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, DEFAP, Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Fdz CMCC, Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattel, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; Bocconi University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Galeotti, M (通讯作者)，Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",marzio.galeotti@unimi.it; yrubashkina@gmail.com; silvia.salini@unimi.it; elena.verdolini@feem.it,"Salini, Silvia/P-8791-2014","Salini, Silvia/0000-0001-6106-9835",MIUR PRIN project MISURA; European Union [308481],MIUR PRIN project MISURA; European Union(European Union (EU)),"Silvia Salini gratefully acknowledges funding from the MIUR PRIN project MISURA.

First, we define three states into which individuals may be placed, which are as follows: the non-fuel-poverty state, the fuel poverty state and the severe fuel poverty state. Second, we use a mover-stayer model that divides the population into the following two types of individuals: those who remain in the same state during the observation period (the stayers) and those who move across states (the movers). This model applies to longitudinal data from mainland France showing that fuel poverty is not an absorbing state. Indeed, a majority of the fuel-poor and the severely fuel-poor move to another, better state. Therefore, we can argue that France has no fuel poverty trap. Using two econometric models (logit and multinomial logit), we identify the stability and mobility determinants in different states. As expected, there is a relationship between income and the likelihood of an individual remaining in a particular state. Furthermore, poor housing implies a greater likelihood of stability in fuel poverty or severe fuel poverty. Another result is that deterioration in fuel poverty status seems to stem more from difficult financial situations than from bad dwelling conditions.","[Chaton, Corinne] Lab Finance Marches Energie FiME, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Lacroix, Elie] Univ Paris 09, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Chaton, C (通讯作者)，Lab Finance Marches Energie FiME, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",cchaton@yahoo.fr; elie.lacroix.11@campus.dauphine.fr,,,,,,,27,20,21,2,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2018,113.0,,,,,,258,268,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.052,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT2XO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423009500025,0

In times of constantly accelerating globalization, intercultural competence, as a set of cognitive, affective, and behavioral skills that enable an individual to communicate and deal appropriately with people of other cultures, appears to be one of the most desirable capabilities for those who work in international environments. Being closely related to one's cultural intelligence, intercultural competence of international managers faces numerous challenges defined by global aspects of the business world, having penetrated into virtually all activities, processes, and routine tasks of international enterprises. This paper points out the increasing need to focus on development of intercultural competences, mainly within the working environment of global enterprises, which is viewed as a predisposition to their effectivity. The focus of this paper is a research into measuring individual intercultural competences: cognitive, affective, and behavioral, which was conducted in the years 2017-2018 on a representative sample of managers of international enterprises located in Slovakia. Intercultural competences were assessed by the self-assessment scale created by the authors and adjusted to reflect the need of a working environment, and the results were analyzed by methods of testing statistical hypothesis. Apart from making conclusions based on the research results, the authors propose further applications of the scale in business environment, as a way to define the need of training intercultural competences in order to achieve competitive advantage in the global market.","[Bencikova, Dana; Mala, Denisa; Dado, Jaroslav] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Mala, D (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",dana.bencikova@umb.sk; denisa.mala@umb.sk; jaroslav.dado@umb.sk,"Mala, Denisa/GVS-2076-2022","Mala, Denisa/0000-0002-5019-6625",VEGA [1/0934/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0934/16 - Cultural intelligence as an essential prerequisite for competitiveness of Slovakia in global environment.,,24,0,0,2,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,30,37,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300005,0

We estimate the parameters by nonlinear generalized method of moments and find that habit formation is an important determinant of household food-consumption patterns.

In the international survey carried out in 2017 by Latvian and Russian researchers, the questionnaire School Teachers' Professional Identity based on the six component model of content of the teacher professional identity was used. The sixth component relates to the public representation of the profession, which is manifested in teachers' social behavior outside of classroom. 437 urban and rural teachers from Latvia and the Smolensk region of Russia participated in the survey. The aim of the article is to analyze and compare the Russian and Latvian data for the professionally determined social behavior of teachers. As a result, conclusions have been drawn about the modern teachers' after hours behavior, which is connected with public representation of the profession; some of them require attention of teachers, school administration, teacher trainers, and executives of educational departments from municipality committees to national ministries.","[Jermolajeva, Jelena] Univ Coll Econ & Culture, Riga, Latvia; [Bogdanova, Tatiana; Silchenkova, Svetlana] Smolensk State Univ, Smolensk, Russia",EKA University of Applied Sciences; Smolensk State University,"Jermolajeva, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Econ & Culture, Riga, Latvia.",jjerm@latnet.lv; tanbogdan@mail.ru; sil-sv@mail.ru,"Svetlana, Silchenkova/R-9921-2016; Jermolajeva, Jelena/AAA-7721-2022","Jermolajeva, Jelena/0000-0002-3483-8405",,,,,21,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,158,166,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300021,0

Our simulation-based research shows that even in case of perfect foresight seasonality decreases the profitability and the ability to grow while increasing the capital need. But, we also conclude that cooperation of SC members may reduce this additional capital need while enhancing the profitability and the growth, thus leading to higher competitiveness. This cooperation may be achieved through regulating payment terms or introducing special fees to be paid by the SC members to the dominating company of the SC. Thus, an economic policy aiming at providing cheap capital to firms at a lower level of SC or increasing their added value at the costs of other SC levels may decrease the competitiveness of the SC in whole.","[Juhasz, Peter; Szaz, Janos; Misik, Sandor] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Finance, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Juhász, P (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Finance, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",peter.juhasz@uni-corvinus.hu; janos.szaz@uni-corvinus.hu; smisik@mol.hu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,EUROPEAN COUNCIL MODELLING & SIMULATION,NOTTINGHAM,"SCHOOL COMPUTING & MATHEMATICS, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, BURTON STREET, NOTTINGHAM, NG1 4BU, ENGLAND",,,978-0-9932440-7-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,46,52,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Engineering, Industrial",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Engineering,BR5JS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000656119000008,0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate which benefits of smart services are the most important for small and medium manufacturing companies. To address the research objective, a qualitative multi-case study was conducted among seven Czech electrotechnical SMEs, which have already started with smart service development. All of the companies included in the research are from the same industry electrotechnical producers. Although they operate in one industry, they provide a wide range of products and services to their customers with varying degrees of service orientation. The empirical data consists of in-depth interviews with owners or with experienced senior managers in the case organizations. The interviews were carried out between April 2017 and January 2018. The findings indicate the main benefits for manufacturers and also for customers. The study is unique in emphasizing the problems of smart services in SMEs in the Czech Republic, where the industrial sector is still dominant in comparison to other European countries.","[Kanovska, Lucie] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Kanovska, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kanovska@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Kanovska, Lucie/AGA-2051-2022",,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,2128,2135,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300272,0

The transport sector of the European Union is an area of great importance from the economic, social and environmental point of view - a developed and efficient transport network supports trade links, promotes economic growth, creates new jobs and improves overall competitive position. It is also a sector facing many challenges related to such phenomena as progressive urbanization, increasing emphasis on reducing negative environmental impact, traffic congestion, or lack of integration between different modes of transport. The way to reduce the impact of these challenges is to increase the efficiency and innovation of the European transport sector in global markets through the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT). The aim of the article is to show the role attributed to ICT solutions for increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of the European transport sector.

The first step in our research is to define the different forms of capital flight as well as their measurement. In the next stage of our observation we detect the channels through which this capital flight is realized, so we determine the reasons of these processes in Euro Area. We will quantify the size of this capital flight by the usage of approach based on the flow of funds' analysis. Our estimation lies on assessment of household sector decisions about holding of financial wealth in the different forms of financial assets in domestic economy and in abroad. We distinguish holding of deposits, short-term and long-term debt securities, listed and investment fund shares as a capital flight in distribution of this financial wealth. Capital flight can bear legal forms as a logic consequence of international economic cooperation and competition in global environment, and illicit forms which by-pass the regulation. In this paper an attention is paid to the legal form of capital flight. Our data sample covers quarterly data for EA19 from integrated economic and financial accounts by institutional sectors between 1999 - 2017. Our results suggest that capital flight measured in the sector of households in legal form takes form especially of listed shares, deposits as well as investment funds share as the consequence of low interest rates in EA19 and depreciated EUR.","[Kotlebova, Jana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Kotlebova, Jana] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Kotlebová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava, Slovakia.;Kotlebová, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava, Slovakia.",jana.kotlebova@euba.sk,"Kotlebova, Jana/AAC-9558-2021","Kotlebova, Jana/0000-0002-2716-0165",Research & Development Operational Programme - ERDF [ITMS 26240120032]; VEGA [1/0613/18]; [APVV-15-0666],Research & Development Operational Programme - ERDF; VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA));,"This paper is an output of the science project APVV-15-0666 Capital Flight and its Impact on the Slovak Economy, project VEGA 1/0613/18 Deepening of Economic Inequalities as a Consequence of Distributional Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy as well as project implementation Creating Excellence in Economic Research Department for Addressing the Challenges of Civilization in the 21th Century (ITMS 26240120032) supported by the Research & Development Operational Programme funded by the ERDF.",,16,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1669,1675,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300213,0

Biogas development can be integrated with strategies to improve sanitation as well as reduce indoor air pollution and greenhouse gases. Currently, the total biogas production in India is 2.07 billion m(3)/year. This is quite low compared to its potential, which is estimated to be in the range of 29-48 billion m(3)/year. Hence, this study aims to identify both technical and non-technological barriers impending biogas dissemination in India. Biogas dissemination is affected by various waste, renewable energy, and urban policies. Barriers were therefore identified individually for rural and urban biogas systems existing in India using decomposition analysis. The results show that type and importance of barriers vary strongly between biogas systems due to the difference in technology maturity, feedstock availability and quality, supply chain, awareness level and policy support.","[Mittal, Shivika; Ahlgren, Erik O.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm, Div Energy Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Shukla, P.

Therefore, the aim of the paper is to examine the position of CEE metropolises in the context of globalization in the region. Some literature study is performed to explain the role of big cities in contemporary economics and metropolisation process. In the empirical part, a taxonomic approach based on Hellwig's development pattern is adopted. The available Eurostat data (NUTS 3 level) on a range of socio-economic characteristics is used. The results show that metropolises of CEE are ahead of their countries in the process of closing the gap between the west and the east. Their positions are relatively much closer to the most developed cities of the EU than the positions of the non-metropolitan parts of their countries. In spite of some concerns, this relatively strong performance of those metropolises should be perceived advantageous for the CEE countries.

These regulations are usually set at a country level, however, the fundamental standards in this extent are outlined by International Labor Organization. In the EU countries, working hours are also a subject to a respective directive. Together with working day, working week length and the number of paid public holidays, paid leave is of great significance when estimating the working time potential in every economy or costs of employing a full-time worker. In the globalization era, it may be one of the drivers of decision about localization for entrepreneurial undertakings. For the employees paid annual leave constitutes an important element to keep a work-life balance. This paper aims to investigate the differences between mean lengths of paid annual leave among countries and regions of the world, including the dependency on years of tenure, and also the identification of the regions with minimal and maximal paid annual leave. Additionally, expected changes in this area as well as problems connected to compliance with laws and regulations will be addressed.

Criminal organizations manage to benefit from strengthened links between states in the global economy and the opportunities for cross-border travel. In the global era, the increasing visibility of inequalities between developed and developing countries makes citizens aspiring for a better life more vulnerable to traffickers. The insatiable demand for 3D workers - those willing to perform dirty, dangerous, and demeaning work in the developed world - creates a market for human beings, taking on the form of modern-day slavery and enabling organized crime to profit on the wayside of globalization: studies indicate that over 20 million people in the world suffer as victims of human trafficking, and the International Labor Organization calculates that the annual profit from modern-day slavery is equivalent to 150 billion dollars. The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between globalization and human trafficking. The articles draws upon desk research, analysis of documents and data from publications on the topic. The main findings are that human trafficking is not simply the result of criminal actions, but is in fact a socio-economic consequence of many factors and conditions with much deeper structural dimensions.","[Petrunov, Georgi] Univ Natl & World Econ, Dept Econ Sociol, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of National & World Economics - Bulgaria,"Petrunov, G (通讯作者)，Univ Natl & World Econ, Dept Econ Sociol, Sofia, Bulgaria.",georgipetrunov@abv.bg,"Petrunov, Georgi/JEF-0477-2023","Petrunov, Georgi/0000-0002-1660-0233","University of National and World Economy, Bulgaria [NID NI-10/2018]","University of National and World Economy, Bulgaria","This paper is an output of the science project NID NI-10/2018 funded by University of National and World Economy, Bulgaria.",,25,0,0,2,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,807,812,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300105,0

Traditional economy is characterised by one-way, linear process, i.e. resources - products - waste, aimed at maximization of social wealth and profit, the process that excessively consumes natural resources, produces uncontrollable amount of waste and has a negative impact on natural resources and the environment that is influenced by globalisation process. By considering an increase in productivity, lowering of costs and fostering competition in Europe, circular economy as a scientific concept represents a model of sustainable development that is a kind of green economy. Before determining the ways of implementation, when introducing circular economy in Slovak economy, it is inevitable to analyse factors that have an impact on this phenomenon. Our paper focuses on defining the analysis results, and on monitoring and utilising innovations in consumer behaviour by implementing circular economy in Slovakia.

One of the main global challenges characterizing the state of the population is poverty. The most dangerous form of poverty from an economic, political and social point of views is a chronic poverty - a situation in which poverty, localized in certain groups of society or in certain regions, is reproduced systematically, i.e. when several generations of people are not able to overcome the factors and causes that once gave rise to poverty. Using quantitative data from Russian monitoring of the economic situation and public health HSE (RLMS-HSE) for the years 2008-2012, authors estimated the chronic poverty among citizens of the Russian Federation. The results clearly show that about 12% of individuals were persistently poor and about 31% were transient poor within the research period. The following causes of chronic poverty in Russia in current international circumstances were highlighted: the long absence of a clear program of economic reform taking into account the social sphere; the presence of a budget imbalance leading to inflation; ineffective programs to protect the population, generating hidden unemployment, a decline in the standard of living and impoverishment of the population.","[Sadyrtdinov, Ruslan; Rodnyansky, Dmitry] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia; [Makarov, Oleg; Milovanov, Yevgeniy] Finance Univ Govt Russian Federat, Lipetsk Branch, Moscow, Russia",Kazan Federal University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation,"Sadyrtdinov, R (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia.",s_ryslan@mail.ru; drodnyansky@gmail.com; oleg250483@mail.ru; milovanov2006@mail.ru,"Sadyrtdinov, Ruslan R/M-2367-2015; Rodnyansky, Dmitry V/J-6424-2016","Sadyrtdinov, Ruslan R/0000-0001-8312-1390;",RFBR [18-310-00040],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project #18-310-00040.,,17,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-249-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,1316,1323,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BS0FL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000681676300169,0

Findings from statistical estimated coefficients indicated that many factors were importance to Thai silk producers and related to consumers willing to pay for a premium price for some attributes. The results showed that the location of retail store, types of business model, and online distribution channel were factors affecting to price setting with a positive impact. The negative factors determining the prices were normal silk fabric (without the Royal peacock logo) and the variety of the product. The outcomes suggest that producers of Thai silk fabric should use the location of store, the business model, and the distribution channel as advantages of a product differentiation strategy to adding value to silk products.","[Supavitarn, Pacharaporn; Lilavanichakul, Apichaya] Kasetsart Univ, Dept Agroind Technol, Fac Agroind, 50 Ngamwongwan Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",Kasetsart University,"Lilavanichakul, A (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Dept Agroind Technol, Fac Agroind, 50 Ngamwongwan Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.",apichaya.l@ku.ac.th,,,Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture,Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture,"The authors would like to thank the Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture, for kindly supporting the survey and providing information for this research.",,8,0,0,1,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2413-0877,,,KNE LIFE SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,204,211,,10.18502/kls.v4i2.1673,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BL1IO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447763100023,0

Of course, this development has not gone unnoticed in the panel unit root literature. However, while the potential of using GLS demeaning is widely recognized, oddly enough, there are still no theoretical results available to facilitate a formal analysis of such demeaning in the panel data context. The present article can be seen as a reaction to this. The purpose is to evaluate the effect of GLS demeaning when used in conjuncture with the pooled OLS t-test for a unit root, resulting in a panel analog of the time series DF-GLS test. A key finding is that the success of GLS depend critically on the order in which the dependent variable is demeaned and first-differenced. If the variable is demeaned prior to taking first-differences, power is maximized by using GLS demeaning, whereas if the differencing is done first, then OLS demeaning is preferred. Furthermore, even if the former demeaning approach is used, such that GLS is preferred, the asymptotic distribution of the resulting test is independent of the tuning parameters that characterize the local alternative under which the demeaning performed. Hence, the demeaning can just as well be performed under the unit root null hypothesis. In this sense, GLS demeaning under the local alternative is redundant.","[Westerlund, Joakim] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Ctr Financial Econometr, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Westerlund, Joakim] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Deakin University; Lund University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Ctr Financial Econometr, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.;Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",J.westerlund@deakin.edu.au,,,Knut and AliceWallenberg Foundation; JanWallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Knut and AliceWallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); JanWallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"Previous versions of the article were presented at seminars at Maastricht University, Monash University, La Trobe University, and Lund University, and at the Econometric Society's 2013 Australasian and European meetings in Sydney and Gothenburg, respectively.

Nevertheless, efficiency improvements could spawn unintended rebound effects, which could offset the expected energy conservation and its associated CO2 reduction. This paper therefore intends to investigate the rebound effect in China's road transport system over the sample period 2003-2013. Utilizing a city-level dataset and a stochastic frontier rebound effect model, we found that there was considerable room to improve the fuel efficiency further in China's eight economic regions. Meanwhile, we also found the occurrence of rebound effects that the magnitudes of which ranged from ranged from 7.2% to 82.2%. The rebound magnitudes were shown to be negatively associated with the level of retail fuel prices, indicating that imposing carbon taxes might be a favorable way to downgrade the rebound effect.

ICT is measured with internet penetration and mobile phone penetration. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The findings broadly show that ICT can be employed to dampen the potentially negative effect of environmental pollution on human development. We establish that: (i) ICT complements CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption to increase inclusive development; (ii) ICT interacts with CO2 intensity to negatively affect inclusive human development and (iii) the net effect on inclusive human development is positive from the complementarity between mobile phones and CO2 emissions per capita. Conversely, we also establish evidence of net negative effects. Fortunately, the corresponding ICT thresholds at which these net negative effects can be completely dampened are within policy range, notably: 50 (per 100 people) mobile phone penetration for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity.

Our objective is to focus policy attention on the sustained added value to the economy that is created by improving energy efficiency in the residential sector. Governments around the world are committed to increasing energy efficiency more generally, but often focus public support in low income households where energy poverty is a particular concern. However, governments operate in a context of multiple objectives where energy efficiency is expected to deliver significant reductions in carbon emissions alongside sustainable economic development. We use a UK CGE model to consider the general effects of supporting increases in energy efficiency in residential energy use. Our results demonstrate that the increase in GDP, and economic activity more generally, triggered by increased energy efficiency delivers more in terms of increased household incomes than the efficiency improvement itself. We find that the more wide ranging the boost to energy efficiency, the greater the economic expansion and associated returns are likely to be, and the less the means of financing through public budgets will erode the benefits over time.","[Figus, Gioele; Turner, Karen; Katris, Antonios] Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Energy Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [McGregor, Peter] Univ Strathclyde, Fraser Allander Inst, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde; University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow,"Figus, G (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Ctr Energy Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",gioele.figus@strath.ac.uk,"; Figus, Gioele/JLL-9519-2023","McGregor, Peter/0000-0003-1221-7963; Katris, Antonios/0000-0001-9352-2307; Figus, Gioele/0000-0002-2642-5504","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M00760X/1]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [1562665]; ClimateXChange; Scottish government; EPSRC [EP/M00760X/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1562665] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L024756/1, EP/M00760X/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ClimateXChange; Scottish government; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors acknowledge support from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant ref.

Although environmental and economic justifications for energy efficiency investments are compelling, there is a gap between the observable and some notion of optimized energy consumption - the so-called energy efficiency gap. Behavioral biases in individual decision making have been resonated by environmental research to explain this gap. To analyze the influence of behavioral biases on decisions upon energy efficiency investments quantitatively, we compare Expected Utility Theory with Cumulative Prospect Theory. On basis of a real-world example, we illustrate how the extent of the gap is influenced by behavioral biases such as loss aversion, probability weighting and framing. Our findings indicate that Cumulative Prospect Theory offers possible explanations for many barriers discussed in literature. For example, the size of the gap rises with increased risk and investment costs. Because behavioral biases are systematic and pervasive, our insights constitute a valuable quantitative basis for environmental policy measures, such as customer-focused and quantitatively backed public awareness campaigns, financial incentives or energy savings insurances. In this vein, this paper may contribute to an accelerated adaption of energy efficiency measures by the broader public.","[Pfosser, Stefan; Traenkler, Timm] Univ Augsburg, Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Haeckel, Bjoern] Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Hsch 1, D-86161 Augsburg, Germany; [Haeckel, Bjoern] Univ Appl Sci Augsburg, Hsch 1, D-86161 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Tränkler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",bjoern.haeckel@fim-rc.de; stefan.pfosser@fim-rc.de; timm.traenkler@fim-rc.de,,,"Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wurttemberg [BWT17004]","Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wurttemberg","Grateful acknowledgement is due to the Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector Baden-Wurttemberg for their support of the Trafo BW project c.HANGE (BWT17004) making this paper possible.",,107,29,34,3,59,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2017,111.0,,,,,,414,426,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.026,0.0,,,13,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FN1VQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415779700042,0

After decades of programs, there is a need to better understand if clean cookstoves are really transforming household energy use, and if not why not. Combining theory from Technological Innovation Systems literature and political economy, the article highlights key weaknesses in the sector and offers explanations for the limited success of efforts to introduce clean cookstoves to date. Clean cookstoves remain a nascent innovation system in Kenya, its main weaknesses being lack of strategic direction, low levels of legitimacy among government and consumers, and weak knowledge accumulation and learning. In the absence of meaningful government engagement, technological choices and business models are influenced by the interests and norms of external actors, including a stronger emphasis on health outcomes than other livelihood or environmental benefits. Going forward, achieving a transformation in cooking energy use will depend on what role national and county governments play. Fiscal incentives introduced in 2016 and work on the country's Sustainable Energy For All action plan are early signs of greater engagement with household energy challenges.","[Atteridge, Aaron; Weitz, Nina] SEI, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm Environment Institute,"Atteridge, A (通讯作者)，Linnegatan 87d, S-11523 Stockholm, Sweden.",aaron.atteridge@sei-international.org,,,Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),This work was supported by the Swedish Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).,,69,8,8,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,303,312,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.029,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800029,0

The analysis reveals that, given the current price and efficiency spectrum of RACs in the Chinese market as well as the electricity price and cooling demand of Chinese households, the MESL for RACs in China should be around 60%, which is much higher than the current subsidy level of 5-15%. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the high MESL (60%) is mainly a consequence of relatively low electricity price and household cooling demand in the country. If China's household cooling demand increases further and its electricity price were to rise to a higher level, the MESL for RACs could possibly drop to about 5-15%. As household cooling demand varies among Chinese cities in different climatic zones and at different levels of economic development, the RAC subsidy incentives should be region-specific. With necessary modifications, the method for analysis proposed in this paper can also be applied to other household appliances to prioritize the types of appliances requiring subsidies.","[Guo, Fei; Pachauri, Shonali; Cofala, Janusz] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Guo, F (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",guof@iiasa.ac.at,"Pachauri, Shonali/AAR-7383-2020","Guo, Fei/0000-0001-6415-8083; Pachauri, Shonali/0000-0001-8138-3178",,,,,51,6,6,2,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,NOV,2017,110.0,,,,,,375,385,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.039,0.0,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FP5LK,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417660800036,0

The answer matters crucially for policy and communication if perceptions of what is true (beliefs) precede feelings (attitudes), additional information could shape views on an energy technology; yet, if attitudes precede beliefs, the usefulness of communication, either for influencing beliefs or simply making the public more informed, is far less clear. A long history of social-psychological research asserts that individuals' beliefs predict their attitudes on environmental issues. Nevertheless, other theories intimate the reverse attitudes shape beliefs, specifically on newly emergent, controversial topics. We investigated whether attitudes (i.e., support and opposition) about the contentious issue of shale gas development stem from or lead to beliefs about development. We collected data from random-sample surveys of residents in the Marcellus Shale region and of a national US sample. Factor analyses and structural equation modelling lead us to question the dominant assumption that beliefs precede attitudes the reverse, or a recursive relationship, appears more likely. Broad values and place attachment precede attitude formation more reliably than beliefs about impacts do suggesting need for a larger focus in energy policy on core values and the ways in which development could foster or compromise these values.","[Evensen, Darrick] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, 70 Pk Pl,Tower Bldg, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Stedman, Rich] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, 104 Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cardiff University; Cornell University,"Evensen, D (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, 70 Pk Pl,Tower Bldg, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",evensend@cardiff.ac.uk; rcs6@corneil.edu,"Evensen, Darrick/AAK-9941-2021","Evensen, Darrick/0000-0001-8892-0052",US Department of Agriculture; US Environmental Protection Agency; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme [640715]; European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie [663830]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [640715] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); US Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)Horizon Europe Research Infrastructures); European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"Funding for this research was provided by federal formula funds from the US Department of Agriculture, administered through Cornell University and via EPA STAR fellowship funding from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

We rely on firm manager assessments on the relevance of energy policy (in terms of taxes, regulations, standards, subsidies and demand stimulation) for their firm operation and link data on adoption and development of new energy technologies.

While the diffusion of new lighting technologies occurs quickly and prices for these technologies drop, at the same time around 1/3 of households in developed European countries continue to choose incandescent light bulbs. This phenomena shows a large potential for saving electricity. Therefore, the aim of our research is to model the diffusion of innovation for energy efficiency solutions in households in Latvia. The methodology combines an empirical study with system dynamics modelling. The model showed that electricity consumption in households decreased by 14% from the year 2015 until the year 2040. The sensitivity analysis shows that changes in the parameters used in this analysis caused expected behaviour, where the uncertainly in electricity consumption in households accounted for +/- 16% in the year 2040. Although this developed system dynamics model was based on a specific process of diffusion of innovation, its general application to other products and services is possible, since the developed model serves as a white-box. The structure of the model can be used for other studies; the model can be enhanced with the newest results or adapted for other case studies.","[Timma, Lelde; Bazbauers, Gatis; Bariss, Uldis; Blumberga, Andra; Blumberga, Dagnija] Riga Tech Univ, Inst Energy Syst & Environm, Azenes Iela 12-1, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Bazbauers, G (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Inst Energy Syst & Environm, Azenes Iela 12-1, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia.",gatis.bazbauers@rtu.lv,"Timma, Lelde/ABA-1978-2020; Blumberga, Dagnija/H-5734-2016","Timma, Lelde/0000-0003-0670-2639;",National Research Program,National Research Program,"The work has been supported by National Research Program Energy efficient and low-carbon solutions for a secure, sustainable and climate variability reducing energy supply (LATENERGI).",,26,12,12,0,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2017,109.0,,,,,,545,554,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.030,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI5OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412034400053,0

However, wildlife uses water and in some cases this may be in conflict with other water uses (e.g. irrigation). To examine the magnitude of this problem and the conceptual and practical challenges of including wildlife water use in the SEEA, estimates of water use for 31 mammals in Botswana were developed using readily available data on their abundance and coefficients of water use. Three recording options were considered for the physical supply and use tables: (1) water use by wildlife shown in a new column entitled Wildlife; (2) shown as a use by industry under Operation of nature reserves and; (3) the preferred option, shown as a split between the first two options, reflecting the location of wildlife inside or outside national parks. The key conceptual issue for recording is the delineation of the production boundary, determined in this case by the extent to which wildlife is deemed managed and hence akin to a cultivated resource in the SEEA. Despite some data limitations, wildlife water use in Botswana was significant, with 21 species accounting for 19,345 ML in 2012-13, equivalent to 10% of the previously estimated water consumption in that year. Water account producers now have clear options for including wildlife, providing water planners and wildlife managers with improved information to help balance competing demands for water that may occur at particular times and places.","[Vardon, Michael] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Pule, Ogopotse Batlokwa; Galegane, Dimpho] Dept Water Affairs, Gaborone, Botswana",Australian National University,"Vardon, M (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",michael.vardon@anu.edu.au; obpule@gmail.com; dgalegane@gov.bw,,"Vardon, Michael J./0000-0002-5708-6824",,,,,38,2,2,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

This paper takes these findings as its starting point and asks, What next? for countries wishing to advance biofuels as one option for the necessary divestment from fossil fuels. Deriving recommendations for national biofuel programs from past performance is no easy task Context, complexity, power dynamics and scaling pose significant challenges to achieving policy aims. We are nevertheless able to distill a set of sine qua nons (indispensables) for sustainable biofuel governance from the evidence and change management literatures.

This suggests a potential for emissions reductions through improved accessibility to efficient technologies. This paper estimates an upper-bound CO2 emission mitigation potential that could theoretically be achieved by improved access to efficient technologies in industrial sectors. We develop a linear optimization framework that facilitates the exchange of sectoral production technologies based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), assuming perfect substitutability of technologies and homogeneity within economic sectors, while ignoring barriers to technological adoption and price driven adjustments. We consider the full global supply chain network and multiple upstream production inputs in addition to energy demand. In contrast to existing literature our framework allows to consider supply chain effects of technology replacements. We use our model to calculate emission reduction potentials for varying levels of access to technology. If best practice technologies were made available globally, CO2 emissions could theoretically be reduced by more than 10 gigatons (Gt). In fact, even second-tier production technologies would create significant global reduction potentials. We decompose sectoral emission reductions to identify contributions by changes in energy intensity, supply chain effects and changes in carbon intensities. Excluding the latter, we find that considering supply chain effects increases total mitigation potentials by 14%. The largest CO2 emission reduction potentials are found for a small set of developing countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores why and how the costs of community-owned projects differ from commercially-owned projects by examining the case of onshore wind in the UK. Based on cross-sectoral literature on the challenges of community ownership, cost differences are attributed to six facets of an organisation or project: internal processes, internal knowledge and skills, perceived local legitimacy of the project, perceived external legitimacy of the organisation, investor motivation and expectations, and finally, project scale. These facets impact not only development costs but also project development times and the probability that projects pass certain critical stages in the development process. Using survey-based and secondary cost data on community and commercial projects in the UK, a model is developed to show the overall impact of cost, time and risk differences on the value of a hypothetical 500 kW onshore wind project. The results show that the main factors accounting for differences are higher pre-planning costs and additional risks born by community projects, and suggest that policy interventions may be required to place community-owned projects on a level playing field with commercial projects.","[Berka, Anna L.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Berka, Anna L.] Univ Auckland, Business Sch, Energy Ctr, Auckland, New Zealand; [Berka, Anna L.; Harnmeijer, Jelte] Scene Consulting, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Harnmeijer, Jelte; Roberts, Deborah; Msika, Joshua] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Dundee, Scotland; [Roberts, Deborah; Phimister, Euan] Univ Aberdeen, Business Sch, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Helsinki; University of Auckland; James Hutton Institute; University of Aberdeen,"Roberts, D (通讯作者)，James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Dundee, Scotland.",deb.roberts@hutton.ac.uk,"Roberts, Deborah/G-8693-2013; Berka, Anna/AAP-9623-2020; Berka, Anna/AAB-4594-2020","Roberts, Deborah/0000-0003-0018-6039; Berka, Anna/0000-0002-9274-6808; Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration [316020]; Scotland's Centre of Expertise on Climate Change ('ClimateXChange')","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration(European Union (EU)); Scotland's Centre of Expertise on Climate Change ('ClimateXChange')","This work has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under Grant agreement no. 316020; and also from the Scotland's Centre of Expertise on Climate Change ('ClimateXChange').

Prior analyses of cost reductions give inconsistent results. The learning rate, or fractional cost reduction per doubling of production, ranges from -3% to +33% depending on the study. This lack of consensus has, we believe, contributed to high variability in forecasts of future costs of wind power. We find that learning rate can be very sensitive to the starting and ending years of datasets and the geographical scope of the study. Based on a single factor experience curve that accounts for capacity factor gains, wind quality decline, and exogenous shifts in capital costs, we develop an improved model with reduced temporal variability. Using a global adoption model, the wind-learning rate is between 7.7% and 11%, with a preferred estimate of 9.8%. Using global scenarios for future wind deployment, this learning rate range implies that the cost of wind power will decline from 5.5 cents/ kWh in 2015 to 4.1-4.5 cents/kWh in 2030, lower than a number of other forecasts. If attained, wind power may be the cheapest form of new electricity generation by 2030, suggesting that support and investment in wind should be maintained or expanded.","[Williams, Eric; Carvalho, Rexon; Williams, Ryan] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 1 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Hittinger, Eric] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Publ Policy, 1 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; Rochester Institute of Technology,"Williams, E (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 1 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",exwgis@rit.edu,,"Williams, Eric/0000-0002-6352-2928","Civil Infrastructure Systems program of the National Science Foundation [CMMI 1436469]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1436469] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Civil Infrastructure Systems program of the National Science Foundation; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",This work was supported by the Civil Infrastructure Systems program of the National Science Foundation (grant# CMMI 1436469).

This paper aims to explore five development scenarios for the five largest economies in SSA to understand the implications to CO2-equivalent emissions (CO2-e) and off-grid energy modernisation in 2030. Within this scope GDP growth; economic structure; availability of energy resources; international trade; and, the development of distributed generation for remote locations are considered. Regional CO2 emissions were studied using a Multi-Regional Input-Output Model for Africa. Under the scenarios analysed all five nations will be unable to reduce 2030 CO2-e emissions below 2012 levels, whilst simultaneously achieving forecast GDP growth and universal access to modernised energy services. 100% off-grid modernisation is estimated to require a three-fold increase in Primary Energy Supply and a 26% (1317 Mt) increase in 2030 CO2-e emissions. Total regional CO2-e emissions could be reduced from 45% to 35% by meeting a 50% renewable energy supply target by 2030. Climate Change policy would need to focus on multi-sector reform to reduce regional emissions as the agricultural sector is the largest emitter in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya.","[Hamilton, Thomas Gerard Adam] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Kelly, Scott] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Ctr Risk Studies, Trumpingtion St, Cambridge CB2 1QA, England; [Kelly, Scott] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Level 11,Bldg 10,235 Jones St Ultimo,2007 POB 123, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Technology Sydney,"Hamilton, TGA (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England.",adam.hamilton@cantab.net; scott.kelly@cantab.net,"Kelly, Scott/ABC-7526-2020; Kelly, Scott/F-8774-2011","Kelly, Scott/0000-0002-8454-6144",Centre for Sustainable Development in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge; Centre of Risk Studies in Cambridge Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge,Centre for Sustainable Development in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge; Centre of Risk Studies in Cambridge Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge,"This research is jointly supported by the Centre for Sustainable Development in the Department of Engineering and Centre of Risk Studies in Cambridge Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge.

Some research, for instance, has indicated that it is easier to build windmills in economically marginalized communities. The evidence for this, however, is still limited. Thus, this study aims to statistically evaluate the extent to which the decisions to approve or reject windmill proposals in Sweden can be explained by factors related to the socio-economic characteristics of people living in the areas surrounding windmill sites. The study is based on an odds ratio analysis of decisions on all windmill proposals in Sweden, in which geo-referenced socio-economic data on an individual level for all inhabitants within 3 and 10 km of the windmill sites are studied. The results show skewness in the distribution of windmills, with a higher likelihood of rejection in areas with more highly educated people and people working in the private sector, compared to a higher likelihood of approval in areas with more unemployed people. Thin skewness, while not necessarily unjust, warrants further policy and research attention to distributional justice issues when developing wind power.","[Liljenfeldt, Johanna; Pettersson, Orjan] Umea Univ, Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Liljenfeldt, J (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden.",johanna.liljenfeldt@geo.uu.se,,,Swedish MISTRA Arctic Sustainable Development (MASD) programme [DIA 2013/049],Swedish MISTRA Arctic Sustainable Development (MASD) programme,The study was partly financed by the Swedish MISTRA Arctic Sustainable Development (MASD) programme (DIA 2013/049).,,45,34,36,4,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,JUN,2017,105.0,,,,,,648,657,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.007,0.0,,,10,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ET8EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400532900063,0

Evidence from a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Difference-in-differences; Electricity demand; Increasing block pricing; Price elasticity; Fuzzy regression discontinuity,RESIDENTIAL WATER DEMAND; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; ELASTICITIES; TARIFFS; PRICES; MODELS; RATES; TAX,"China is the largest electricity consumption country after it has passed the United States in 2011. Residential electricity consumption in China grew by 381.35% (12.85% per annum) between 2000 and 2013. In order to deal with rapid growth in residential electricity consumption, an increasing block pricing policy was introduced for residential electricity consumers in China on July 1st, 2012. Using difference-in-differences models with a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we estimate a causal effect of price on electricity consumption for urban households during the introduction of increasing block pricing policy in Guangdong province of China. We find that consumers do not respond to a smaller (approximately 8%) increase in marginal price. However, consumers do respond to a larger increase in marginal price. An approximately 40% increase in marginal price induces an approximately 35% decrease in electricity use (284 kWh per month). Our results suggest that although the increasing block pricing could affect the behavior of households with higher electricity use, there is only a limit potential to overall energy conservation.","[Zhang, Zibin; Cai, Wenxin] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, Dept Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Feng, Xiangzhao] Minist Environm Protect PR China, Policy Res Ctr Environm & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Feng, XZ (通讯作者)，Minist Environm Protect PR China, Policy Res Ctr Environm & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Zbzhang@zju.edu.cn; Wxcai@zju.edu.cn; Feng.xiangzhao@prcee.org,"Zhang, Zibin/J-8873-2014",,Ministry of Education of China for the Key Social Sciences and Humanities Project [12JJD790043]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hengyi Private Economy Research Foundation of Zhejiang University,Ministry of Education of China for the Key Social Sciences and Humanities Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Hengyi Private Economy Research Foundation of Zhejiang University,"We thank two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.
