Such equilibria in the form of random state-to-action rules are parsimonious in form and easy to execute, as they are both oblivious of past history and blind to other players' present states. Our transient results can be extended to a stationary case, where the finite multi-period games are special discounted stochastic games. In both nonatomic and finite games, players' states influence their payoffs along with actions they take; also, the random evolution of one particular player's state is driven by all players' states as well as actions. The finite games can model diverse situations such as dynamic price competition. But they are notoriously difficult to analyze. Our results thus suggest ways to tackle these problems approximately.","[Yang, Jian] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",jyang@business.rutgers.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [CMMI-0854803]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11371273, 71502015]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant CMMI-0854803, as well as National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants 11371273 and 71502015.",,35,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

In this paper, we analytically investigate the effect of portfolio constraints on the TCIE of convex cone-constrained markets. More specifically, we derive semi-analytical expressions for the precommitted efficient mean-variance policy and the minimum-variance signed supermartingale measure (VSSM) and examine their relationship. Our analysis shows that the precommitted discrete-time efficient mean-variance policy satisfies TCIE if and only if the conditional expectation of the density of the VSSM (with respect to the original probability measure) is nonnegative, or once the conditional expectation becomes negative, it remains at the same negative value until the terminal time. Our finding indicates that the TCIE property depends only on the basic market setting, including portfolio constraints. This motivates us to establish a general procedure for constructing TCIE dynamic portfolio selection problems by introducing suitable portfolio constraints.","[Cui, Xiangyu] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xiangyu] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Duan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xun] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Li, D (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dli@se.cuhk.edu.hk,"Cui, Xiangyu/J-4419-2016; Li, Duan/E-7985-2011; Li, Xun/K-6344-2014","Li, Duan/0000-0001-9786-6238; Li, Xun/0000-0003-0493-417X","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [414610, 520412]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201094]; Shanghai Pujiang Program of China [12PJC051]; Patrick Huen Wing Ming Chair Professorship of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management",Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program of China(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Patrick Huen Wing Ming Chair Professorship of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management,"This research was partially supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong under grants 414610 and 520412, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 71201094, and the Shanghai Pujiang Program of China under grant 12PJC051.

Agents have preferences either for segregation or for mixed neighborhoods. Utility is non-transferable. Two agents exchange houses when the trade is mutually beneficial. We find that an allocation is stable when for two agents of opposite-color each black (white) agent has a higher proportion of neighbors who are black (white). This result holds irrespective of agents' preferences. When all members of both groups prefer mixed neighborhoods, an allocation is also stable provided that if an agent belongs to the minority (majority), then any neighbor of opposite-color is in a smaller minority (larger majority).","[Cui, Zhiwei] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Hwang, Yan-An] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Appl Math, Hualien 97401, Taiwan",Beihang University; National Dong Hwa University,"Cui, ZW (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",zhiweicuisx@gmail.com; yahwang@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,,"Cui, Zhiwei/0000-0002-2822-2145","National Science Foundation of China [61202425]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YWF-13-D2-JC-11, YWF-14-JGXY-016]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for suggesting ways to improve the substance and exposition of this paper.

A local linear estimation method is developed to estimate the unknown regression function. The asymptotic results of the resulting estimator at both interior points and boundaries are obtained. The asymptotic distribution is mixed normal, associated with the local time of an OrnsteinUhlenbeck fractional Brownian motion. Furthermore, we study the Nadaraya- Watson estimator and we examine its asymptotic results. As a result, it shares exactly the same asymptotic results as those for the local linear estimator for the zero energy situation. However, for the non- zero energy case, the local linear estimator is superior to the Nadaraya- Watson estimator in terms of optimal convergence rate. We also present a comparison of our results with the conventional results for stationary covariates. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.","[Cai, Zongwu] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Cai, Zongwu] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Cai, Zongwu] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jing, Bingyi] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kong, Xinbing] Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi] Univ Macau, Dept Math, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi] UMacau Zhuhai Res Inst, 1 Software Rd, Zhuhai Hi Tech Zone 519080, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Kansas; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Nanjing Audit University; University of Macau,"Kong, XB (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",caiz@ku.edu; majing@ust.hk; kongxblqh@gmail.com; liuzhi@umac.mo,,,"National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71131008, 71631004]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [HKUST6019/10P, HKUST6019/12P]; NSFC [11571250, 11401607]; HSSYF of the Chinese Ministry of Education [12YJC910003]; PAPD of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institution; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund [078/2013/A3]","National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); HSSYF of the Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); PAPD of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institution; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund","Z.

The variance is decomposed into an unconditional and a conditional component such that the unconditional variance component is allowed to evolve smoothly over time. This nonstationary component is defined as a linear combination of logistic transition functions with time as the transition variable. The appropriate number of transition functions is determined by a sequence of specification tests. For that purpose, a coherent modelling strategy based on statistical inference is presented. It is heavily dependent on Lagrange multiplier type misspecification tests. The tests are easily implemented as they are entirely based on auxiliary regressions. Finite-sample properties of the strategy and tests are examined by simulation. The modelling strategy is illustrated in practice with two real examples: an empirical application to daily exchange rate returns and another one to daily coffee futures returns.","[Amado, Cristina] Univ Minho, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Amado, Cristina] NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Amado, Cristina; Terasvirta, Timo] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Universidade do Minho; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Amado, C (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Amado, C (通讯作者)，NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",camado@eeg.uminho.pt,"Terasvirta, Timo/J-1621-2019; Amado, Cristina/B-9811-2009","Amado, Cristina/0000-0003-2173-7856; Terasvirta, Timo/0000-0002-0947-2114",CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Danish Council for Independent Research [12-126018]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program Factors of Competitiveness (COMPETE); FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/IIM-FIN/4685/2012]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/IIM-FIN/4685/2012] Funding Source: FCT,CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Program Factors of Competitiveness (COMPETE)(European Union (EU)); FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work has been supported by CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78), funded by the Danish National Research Foundation.

The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by assessing the consequences of operational risk for a financial firm including reputational losses. Toward this end, we extend current operational risk models by incorporating reputation losses. We propose three different models for reputation risk: a simple deterministic approach, a stochastic model using distributional assumptions, and an extension of the second model by taking into account a firm's ability to deal with reputation events. Our results emphasize that reputational losses can by far exceed the original operational loss and that neglecting reputational losses may lead to a severe underestimation of certain operational risk types and especially fraud events.

We focus on the unconditional case in which the observed information is in terms the minimal and maximal values at each period. Given interval data, we infer the joint and marginal distributions of the interval variable and its range. Our inferential procedure is based on entropy maximization subject to multidimensional moment conditions and normalization in which the entropy is defined over discretized intervals. The discretization is based on theory or empirically observed quantities. The number of estimated parameters is independent of the discretization so the level of discretization does not change the fundamental level of complexity of our model.

The introduction of a closed-form solution is an innovative aspect of the model we propose. We evaluate the impact of dynamic policyholders' behavior modeling the dependence between interest rates and surrendering (affine dependence) with the assumption that mortality rates are independent of interest rates and surrendering.

Volatility clustering arises in our model due to speculators' herding behaviour. In case of heightened uncertainty, speculators observe other speculators' actions more closely. Since speculators' trading behaviour then becomes less heterogeneous, the market maker faces a less balanced excess demand and consequently adjusts prices more strongly. Estimating our model using the method of simulated moments reveals that it is able to explain a number of stylized facts of financial markets quite well. Various robustness checks with respect to the model setup reveal that our results are quite stable.","[Schmitt, Noemi; Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Westerhoff, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",frank.westerhoff@uni-bamberg.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103;",,,,,60,33,35,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In a context where the enforcing authority cannot prevent agents (who seek to reduce their cost shares) from splitting or merging their demands, the cost sharing methods used must make such artifices unprofitable. The paper introduces a family of rules that are immune to these demand manipulations, the pattern methods. Our main result is the characterization of these methods using the above requirement. For each one of these methods, the associated pattern indicates how to combine the technologies in order to meet the agents' demands. Within this family, two rules stand out: the public Aumann-Shapley rule, which never rewards technological cooperation; and the private Aumann-Shapley rule, which always rewards technology providers. Fairness requirements imposing natural bounds (for the technological rent) allow to further differentiate these two rules.","[Bahel, Eric] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Trudeau, Christian] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Windsor,"Trudeau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON, Canada.",erbahel@vt.edu; trudeauc@uwindsor.ca,,"Trudeau, Christian/0000-0003-4195-4153",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [435-2014-0140],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The authors thank Herve Moulin and Yves Sprumont for stimulating conversations.

I develop a revelation mechanism that enables the contest designer to select a subset of contestants from a pool of candidates in a way that maximizes her profits, even though she is uninformed about the candidates' valuations for the contest prize. I prove the existence of an incentive compatible and individually rational mechanism. I solve the designer's problem by using a three-stage game. At Stage 0, the designer designs a mechanism. At Stage 1, candidates participate in the mechanism then a subset of candidates become contestants. Lastly, at Stage 2, information is revealed and the contestants participate in a contest. I show that the optimal size of a contest depends on contestants' types, the cost of the prize to the designer and on the marginal cost that a contestant imposes on the designer. Contrary to models in which an entry fee s access to the contest, the designer can elicit truthful revelations by imposing revelation costs, and in turn is able to select the optimal subset of contestants.","[Mercier, Jean-Francois] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, Bellarmine Coll Liberal Arts, 1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",,"Mercier, JF (通讯作者)，Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, Bellarmine Coll Liberal Arts, 1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",jmercier@lmu.edu,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

We assume the network effects to be linear and, in contrast to the claim in Kohlberg (Econ Lett 11:211-216, 1983), derive a condition under which a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium exists for four and six firms.

Our results suggest that a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium exists if and only if the number of firms is even.

V@R is a quantile-based risk measure and neglects extreme risks in the tail. V@R belongs to the family of distortion risk measures. A serious deficiency of V@R is that firms can hide their total downside risk in corporate networks, unless a consolidated solvency balance sheet is required for each economic scenario. In this case, they can largely reduce their total capital requirements via appropriate transfer agreements within a network structure consisting of sufficiently many entities and thereby circumvent capital regulation. We prove several versions of such a result for general distortion risk measures of V@R-type, explicitly construct suitable allocations of the network portfolio, and finally demonstrate how these findings can be extended beyond distortion risk measures. We also discuss why consolidation requirements cannot completely eliminate this problem. Capital regulation should thus be based on coherent or convex risk measures like average value at risk or expectiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that comonotonicity cannot be characterized by the properties of the acceptance set alone and heavily depends on the choice of the eligible asset. In fact, in many important cases, comonotonicity is only compatible with risk-free eligible assets. The incompatibility with risky eligible assets is systematic whenever the acceptability criterion is based on Value-at-Risk or any convex distortion risk measure such as Expected Shortfall.

Jumps, in particular exponential Levy and affine models, which exhibit small-maturity exploding smiles, have historically been proposed to remedy this (see Tankov in Pricing and hedging in exponential Levy models: review of recent results. Paris-Princeton Lecture Notes in Mathematical Finance, Springer, Berlin, 2010 for an overview), and more recently rough volatility models (Alos et al. in On the short-time behavior of the implied volatility for jump-diffusion models with stochastic volatility.

If a risk measure is evaluated on the estimated mixture instead of the (unknown) true one, then it is important to investigate the committed error. In this paper we study the asymptotic behaviour of estimated risk measures, as the data sample size tends to infinity, in the fashion of large deviations. We obtain large deviation results by applying the contraction principle, and the rate functions are given by a suitable variational formula; explicit expressions are available for mixtures of two models.

Second, we show that uncertainty shocks can generate drops in gross domestic product of around 2.5% in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms. However, we also find that uncertainty shocks need to be supplemented by first-moment shocks to fit consumption over the cycle. So our data and simulations suggest recessions are best modelled as being driven by shocks with a negative first moment and a positive second moment.

The condition significantly decreases quality of life and generates a substantial economic burden for healthcare payers, patients and the society in which they live. Some patients require chronic pharmacotherapy, and access to novel biologic drugs might be crucial for long-term remission. The analyses of cost-effectiveness for biologic drugs are necessary to assess their efficiency and provide the best available drugs to patients. Objective Our aim was to collect and assess the quality of economic analyses carried out for biologic agents used in the treatment of UC, as well as to summarize evidence on the drivers of cost-effectiveness and evaluate the transferability and generalizability of conclusions. Methods A systematic database review was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and CRD0. Both authors independently reviewed the identified articles to determine their eligibility for final review. Hand searching of references in collected papers was also performed to find any relevant articles. The reporting quality of economic analyses included was evaluated by two reviewers using the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement checklist. We reviewed the sensitivity analyses in cost-effectiveness analyses to identify the variables that may have changed the conclusions of the study. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were selected by identifying uncertain parameters that caused the highest change of the results of the analyses compared with base-case results. Results Of the 576 identified records, 87 were excluded as duplicates and 16 studies were included in the final review; evaluations for Canada, the UK and Poland were mostly performed. The majority of the evaluations revealed were performed for infliximab (approximately 75% of total volume); however, some assessments were also performed for adalimumab (50%) and golimumab (31%). Only three analyses were conducted for vedolizumab, whereas no relevant studies were found for etrolizumab and tofacitinib. The reporting quality of the included economic analyses was assessed as high, with an average score of 21 points per 24 maximum possible (range 14-23 points according to the ISPOR CHEERS statement checklist). In the case of most analyses, quality-adjusted life-years were used as a clinical outcome, and endpoints such as remission, response and mucosal healing were less common. The higher clinical effectiveness (based on response rates) of biological treatment over non-biological treatments was presented in revealed analyses. The incremental cost-utility ratios for biologics, compared with standard care, varied significantly between the studies and ranged from US$36,309 to US$456,979. The lowest value was obtained for infliximab and the highest for the treatment scheme including infliximab 5 mg/kg and infliximab 10 mg/kg + adalimumab. The change of utility weights and clinical parameters had the most significant influence on the results of the analysis; the variable related to surgery was the least sensitive. Conclusions Limited data on the cost-effectiveness of UC therapy were identified. In the majority of studies, the lack of cost-effectiveness was revealed for biologics, which was associated with their high costs.

Techniques of fractional cointegration analysis are used to examine the relationship between German and Spanish government bond yields with maturities of two, five, seven and ten years in the period 05 January 2001 to 29 December 2006. Back then (in the good times of the currency union) financial markets did not have to fear exchange rate risk and sovereign credit risk. Thus, the risk premia to be observed were small and driven by liquidity risk. Economic theory suggests that a cointegration vector of (1,-1) between the interest rates can only exist when markets do not expect exchange rate movements and the risk premium is not interest rate sensitive (or practically speaking the sensitivity is low). Given the data set examined here, it is probably no surprise that the interest rates of the two countries are cointegrated and that the cointegration vector of German and Spanish government bond yields with maturities of two, five and seven years seems to be (1,-1). We then have also examined the degree of interest rate sensitivity of the yield spread between Spain and Germany. The differential between the yields of the two countries in all maturity brackets do not react to the level of interest rates in the currency union. This fits perfectly to our results with regard to the cointegration vector.","[Basse, Tobias; Kunze, Frederik] Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozent, Friedrichswall 10, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Basse, Tobias] Touro Coll Berlin, Rupenhorn 5, D-14055 Berlin, Germany; [Wegener, Christoph] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Wegener, Christoph] Ctr Risk & Insurance, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Kunze, Frederik] Univ Goettingen, Chair Econ Policy & SME Res, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",IPAG Business School; University of Gottingen,"Basse, T (通讯作者)，Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozent, Friedrichswall 10, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.;Basse, T (通讯作者)，Touro Coll Berlin, Rupenhorn 5, D-14055 Berlin, Germany.",tobias.basse@nordlb.de,"Wegener, Christoph/I-7018-2019","Wegener, Christoph/0000-0002-9508-7131",,,,,39,10,10,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Using the distribution of recurrence intervalsthe waiting time between consecutive extremeswe show that these extreme returns are predictable in the short term. Examining a range of different types of returns and thresholds we find that recurrence intervals follow a q-exponential distribution, which we then use to theoretically derive the hazard probability http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink. Maximizing the usefulness of extreme forecasts to define an optimized hazard threshold, we indicate a financial extreme occurring within the next day when the hazard probability is greater than the optimized threshold. Both in-sample tests and out-of-sample predictions indicate that these forecasts are more accurate than a benchmark that ignores the predictive signals. This recurrence interval finding deepens our understanding of reoccurring extreme returns and can be applied to forecast extremes in risk management.","[Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Finance, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Ctr Finance & Investment Management, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Wang, Gang-Jin; Canabarro, Askery; Stanley, H.

Here, we allow for correlations between the US and Korean variables and suggest two types of endogeneity, namely endogeneity in the regressors and in the regime-switching probabilities. The estimation results show that both types of endogeneity are present in the US variables and that the parameter estimates are quite different when endogeneity is considered, indicating a serious endogeneity bias in the parameter estimates. The results of the endogeneity test for the regressors show that the effects of global shocks are often persistent and may last for as long as six periods.

The aim of this study was to investigate the costs of research, serving two purposes: (1) estimating research costs for use in VOI analyses; and (2) developing a costing tool to support reviewers of grant proposals in assessing whether the proposed budget is realistic. For granted study proposals from the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw), type of study, potential cost drivers, proposed budget, and general characteristics were extracted. Regression analysis was conducted in an attempt to generate a 'predicted budget' for certain combinations of cost drivers, for implementation in the costing tool. Of 133 drug-related research grant proposals, 74 were included for complete data extraction. Because an association between cost drivers and budgets was not confirmed, we could not generate a predicted budget based on regression analysis, but only historic reference budgets given certain study characteristics. The costing tool was designed accordingly, i.e. with given selection criteria the tool returns the range of budgets in comparable studies. This range can be used in VOI analysis to estimate whether the expected net benefit of sampling will be positive to decide upon the net value of future research. The absence of association between study characteristics and budgets may indicate inconsistencies in the budgeting or granting process. Nonetheless, the tool generates useful information on historical budgets, and the option to formally relate VOI to budgets.

As preference-based measures provide different values when collected from the same patient, it is important to ensure that all HSUVs used within a single model are obtained from the same instrument where ever possible. When people enter the model without the condition of interest (e.g. primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, screening or vaccination programmes), appropriate age- and gender-adjusted HSUVs from people without the particular condition should be used as the baseline. General population norms may be used as a proxy if the exact condition-specific evidence is not available. Individual discrete health states should be used for serious adverse reactions to treatment and the corresponding HSUVs sourced as normal. Care should be taken to avoid double counting when capturing the effects for both less severe adverse reactions (e.g. itchy skin rash or dry cough) and more severe adverse events (e.g. fatigue in oncology). Transparency in reporting standards for both the justification of the evidence used and any 'adjustments' is important to increase readers' confidence that the evidence used is the most appropriate available.","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Zouraq, Ismail Azzabi] Takeda Pharmaceut Int AG, Thurgauerstr 130, CH-8152 Glattpark Opfikon, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Sheffield; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,27,12,13,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S77,S88,,10.1007/s40273-017-0550-0,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052163.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400010,0

It is demonstrated that the norms defined by EV@R induce the same Banach spaces, irrespective of the confidence level. Three vector spaces, called the primal, dual, and bidual entropic spaces, corresponding with EV@R are fully studied. It is shown that these spaces equipped with the norms induced by EV@R are Banach spaces. The entropic spaces are then related to the L-p spaces, as well as specific Orlicz hearts and Orlicz spaces. This analysis indicates that the primal and bidual entropic spaces can be used as very flexible model spaces, larger than L-infinity, over which all L-p-based risk measures are well-defined. The dual EV@R norm and corresponding Hahn-Banach functionals are presented in closed form, which are not explicitly known for the Orlicz and Luxemburg norms that are equivalent to the EV@R norm. The duality relationships among the entropic spaces are investigated. The duality results are also used to develop an extended Donsker-Varadhan variational formula, and to explicitly provide the dual and Kusuoka representations of EV@R, as well as the corresponding maximizing densities in both representations. Our results indicate that financial concepts can be successfully used to develop insightful tools for not only the theory of modern risk measurement but also other fields of stochastic analysis and modeling.","[Ahmadi-Javid, Amir] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Pichler, Alois] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Fak Math, Chemnitz, Germany",Amirkabir University of Technology; Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Ahmadi-Javid, A (通讯作者)，Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran.",ahmadi_javid@aut.ac.ir; alois.pichler@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de,"Ahmadi-Javid, Amir/M-2363-2015","Ahmadi-Javid, Amir/0000-0002-9132-6887; Pichler, Alois/0000-0001-8876-2429",,,,,44,14,14,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The paper presents an efficient method that parallelizes Bayesian computation using distributed computing on Apache Spark across a cluster of computers. The distributed algorithm dramatically boosts the speed of Bayesian computation and expands the scope of applicability of Bayesian methods in insurance modeling. The empirical analysis applies a Bayesian hierarchical Tweedie model to a big data of 13 million insurance claim records. The distributed algorithm achieves as much as 65 times performance gain over the non-parallel method in this application. The analysis demonstrates that Bayesian methods can be of great value to large-scaled insurance predictive modeling.","[Zhang, Yanwei] Uber Technol, 1455 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA","Uber Technologies, Inc.","Zhang, YW (通讯作者)，Uber Technol, 1455 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.",actuary_zhang@hotmail.com,,,,,,,36,3,4,4,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2017,47.0,3,,,,,943,961,,10.1017/asb.2017.15,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FE9ZW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408563000011,0

Interval ambiguity involves a symmetric range of 50- n to 50+ n red cards. Complementarily, disjoint ambiguity arises from two nonintersecting intervals of 0 to n and 100 - n to 100 red cards. Two-point ambiguity involves n or 100 - n red cards. We investigate experimentally attitudes towards partial ambiguity and the corresponding compound lotteries in which the possible compositions are drawn with equal objective probabilities. This yields three key findings: distinct attitudes towards the three forms of partial ambiguity, significant association across attitudes towards partial ambiguity and compound risk, and source preference between two-point ambiguity and two-point compound risk.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission to NICE. The evidence, which included a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of degarelix versus leuprorelin, found that degarelix was non-inferior to leuprorelin for reduction of testosterone levels and that degarelix achieved a more rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen levels and subsequently decreased incidences of testosterone flare associated with luteinising hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonists. However, protection against testosterone flare for the comparators in the clinical trials was not employed in line with UK clinical practice. Further claims surrounding overall survival, cardiovascular adverse events and clinical equivalence of the comparator drugs from six RCTs of degarelix should be regarded with caution because of flaws and inconsistencies in the pooling of trial data to draw conclusions. The cost-effectiveness evidence included a de novo economic model. Based on the ERG's preferred base case, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (ICER) for degarelix versus 3-monthly triptorelin was A 14,798 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Additional scenario analyses undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs for degarelix versus 3-monthly triptorelin ranging from A 17,067 pound to A 35,589 pound per QALY gained. Subgroup analyses undertaken using the Appraisal Committee's preferred assumptions suggested that degarelix was not cost effective for the subgroup with metastatic disease but could be cost effective for the subgroup with spinal metastases. The company submitted further evidence to NICE following an initial negative Appraisal Committee decision. Further analyses from the Decision Support Unit found that that, whilst some evidence indicated that degarelix could be cost effective for a small subgroup of people with spinal cord compression (SCC), data on the potential size of this subgroup and the rate of SCC were insufficient to estimate an ICER based on the evidence submitted by the company and a separately commissioned systematic review. NICE recommended degarelix as an option for treating advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer in people with spinal metastases, only if the commissioner can achieve at least the same discounted drug cost as that available to the UK NHS in June 2016.","[Uttley, Lesley; Whyte, Sophie; Gomersall, Timothy; Ren, Shijie; Wong, Ruth; Chambers, Duncan; Tappenden, Paul] Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Uttley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",l.uttley@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Uttley, Lesley/0000-0003-4603-9069; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; Chambers, Duncan/0000-0002-0154-0469",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [12/64/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 12/64/01).

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the company's submission to NICE. Clinical evidence for cabazitaxel was derived from a multinational randomised open-label phase III trial (TROPIC) of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisolone, which was assumed to represent best supportive care. The NICE final scope identified a further three comparators: abiraterone in combination with prednisone or prednisolone; enzalutamide; and radium-223 dichloride for the subgroup of people with bone metastasis only (no visceral metastasis). The company did not consider radium-223 dichloride to be a relevant comparator. Neither abiraterone nor enzalutamide has been directly compared in a trial with cabazitaxel. Instead, clinical evidence was synthesised within a network meta-analysis (NMA). Results from TROPIC showed that cabazitaxel was associated with a statistically significant improvement in both overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mitoxantrone. Results from a random-effects NMA, as conducted by the company and updated by the ERG, indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the three active treatments for both overall survival and progression-free survival. Utility data were not collected as part of the TROPIC trial, and were instead taken from the company's UK early access programme. Evidence on resource use came from the TROPIC trial, supplemented by both expert clinical opinion and a UK clinical audit. List prices were used for mitoxantrone, abiraterone and enzalutamide as directed by NICE, although commercial in-confidence patient-access schemes (PASs) are in place for abiraterone and enzalutamide. The confidential PAS was used for cabazitaxel. Sequential use of the advanced hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) does not usually occur in clinical practice in the UK. Hence, cabazitaxel could be used within two pathways of care: either when an advanced hormonal therapy was used pre-docetaxel, or when one was used post-docetaxel. The company believed that the former pathway was more likely to represent standard National Health Service (NHS) practice, and so their main comparison was between cabazitaxel and mitoxantrone, with effectiveness data from the TROPIC trial. Results of the company's updated cost-effectiveness analysis estimated a probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 45,982 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, which the committee considered to be the most plausible value for this comparison. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be both cheaper and more effective than abiraterone. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be cheaper but less effective than enzalutamide, resulting in an ICER of A 212,038 pound per QALY gained for enzalutamide compared with cabazitaxel. The ERG noted that radium-223 is a valid comparator (for the indicated sub-group), and that it may be used in either of the two care pathways. Hence, its exclusion leads to uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results. In addition, the company assumed that there would be no drug wastage when cabazitaxel was used, with cost-effectiveness results being sensitive to this assumption: modelling drug wastage increased the ICER comparing cabazitaxel with mitoxantrone to over A 55,000 pound per QALY gained. The ERG updated the company's NMA and used a random effects model to perform a fully incremental analysis between cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide and best supportive care using PASs for abiraterone and enzalutamide. Results showed that both cabazitaxel and abiraterone were extendedly dominated by the combination of best supportive care and enzalutamide. Preliminary guidance from the committee, which included wastage of cabazitaxel, did not recommend its use. In response, the company provided both a further discount to the confidential PAS for cabazitaxel and confirmation from NHS England that it is appropriate to supply and purchase cabazitaxel in pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags, which would remove the cost of drug wastage. As a result, the committee recommended use of cabazitaxel as a treatment option in people with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with at least 225 mg/m(2) of docetaxel, as long as it was provided at the discount agreed in the PAS and purchased in either pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags or in vials at a reduced price to reflect the average per-patient drug wastage.","[Kearns, Benjamin; Pandor, Abdullah; Stevenson, Matt; Hamilton, Jean; Chambers, Duncan; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, John] Taunton & Somerset NHS Fdn Trust, Taunton, Somerset, England; [Kumar, M.

Both the investment criterion and the optimal strategy are characterized by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on a semi-infinite time interval. In the case where this equation can be linearized, the problem reduces to a time-reversed parabolic equation, which cannot be analyzed via the standard methods of partial differential equations. Under the additional uniform ellipticity condition, we make use of the available description of all minimal solutions to such equations, along with some basic facts from potential theory and convex analysis, to obtain an explicit integral representation of all positive solutions. These results allow us to construct a large family of the aforementioned optimality criteria, including some closed-form examples in relevant financial models.","[Nadtochiy, Sergey] Univ Michigan, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tehranchi, Michael] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Cambridge,"Nadtochiy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sergeyn@umich.edu,,"Nadtochiy, Sergey/0000-0003-2624-5033",,,,,59,18,18,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

One approach is the formal elicitation and use of patient preferences for weighing clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how patient preferences can be used to weigh clinical outcomes when both preferences and clinical outcomes are uncertain by applying a probabilistic value-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. Probability distributions were used to model random variation and parameter uncertainty in preferences, and parameter uncertainty in clinical outcomes. The posterior value distributions and rank probabilities for each treatment were obtained using Monte-Carlo simulations. The probability of achieving the first rank is the probability that a treatment represents the highest value to patients. We illustrated our methodology for a simplified case on six HIV treatments. Preferences were modeled with normal distributions and clinical outcomes were modeled with beta distributions. The treatment value distributions showed the rank order of treatments according to patients and illustrate the remaining decision uncertainty. This study demonstrated how patient preference data can be used to weigh clinical evidence using MCDA. The model takes into account uncertainty in preferences and clinical outcomes. The model can support decision makers during the aggregation step of the MCDA process and provides a first step toward preference-based personalized medicine, yet requires further testing regarding its appropriate use in real-world settings.","[Broekhuizen, Henk; IJzerman, Maarten J.; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

The main results of this work are: developed heuristic approaches for the prospect theory model proposed by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979 as well as an empirical comparative analysis of this model and the index tracking model. The crucial assumption is that behavioural features of the prospect theory model provide better downside protection than traditional approaches to the portfolio selection problem. In this research the large-scale computational results for the prospect theory model have been obtained for real financial market data with up to 225 assets. Previously, as far as we are aware, only small laboratory tests (2-3 artificial assets) have been presented in the literature. In order to investigate empirically the performance of the behaviourally based model, a differential evolution algorithm and a genetic algorithm which are capable of dealing with a large universe of assets have been developed. Specific breeding and mutation, as well as normalization, have been implemented in the algorithms. A tabulated comparative analysis of the algorithms' parameter choice is presented. The prospect theory model with the reference point being the index is compared to the index tracking model. A cardinality constraint has been implemented to the basic index tracking and the prospect theory models. The portfolio diversification benefit has been found. The aggressive behaviour in terms of returns of the prospect theory model with the reference point being the index leads to better performance of this model in a bullish market. However, it performed worse in a bearish market than the index tracking model. A tabulated comparative analysis of the performance of the two studied models is provided in this paper for in-sample and out-of-sample tests. The performance of the studied models has been tested out-of-sample in different conditions using simulation of the distribution of a growing market and simulation of the t-distribution with fat tails which characterises the dynamics of a decreasing or crisis market.","[Grishina, N.; Lucas, C.

Reduced competition may increase the premiums charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it may also strengthen insurers' bargaining leverage when negotiating with hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospital-insurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10% across markets.","[Ho, Kate] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ho, Kate; Lee, Robin S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lee, Robin S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Ho, K (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Ho, K (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kh2214@columbia.edu; robinlee@fas.harvard.edu,,,NYU Stern Center for Global Economy and Business,NYU Stern Center for Global Economy and Business,"This paper replaces an earlier working paper titled Insurer Competition and Negotiated Hospital Prices.

The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness data used in the company's economic analysis were derived from a single randomised controlled trial, AZA-AML-001. It was an international, multicentre, controlled, phase III study with an open-label, parallel-group design conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of azacitidine against a conventional care regimen (CCR). The CCR was a composite comparator of acute myeloid leukaemia treatments currently available in the National Health Service: intensive chemotherapy followed by best supportive care (BSC) upon disease relapse or progression, non-intensive chemotherapy followed by BSC and BSC only. In AZA-AML-001, the primary endpoint was overall survival. Azacitidine appeared to be superior to the CCR, with median overall survival of 10.4 and 6.5 months, respectively. However, in the intention-to-treat analysis, the survival advantage associated with azacitidine was not statistically significant. The company submitted a de novo economic evaluation based on a partitioned survival model with four health states: Remission, Non-remission, Relapse/Progressive disease and Death. The model time horizon was 10 years. The perspective was the National Health Service and Personal Social Services. Costs and health effects were discounted at the rate of 3.5 % per year. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of azacitidine compared with the CCR was A 20,648 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was A 17,423 pound per QALY. At the willingness-to-pay of A 20,000 pound, A 30,000 pound and A 50,000 pound per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was 0.699, 0.908 and 0.996, respectively. The ERG identified a number of errors in Celgene's model and concluded that the results of the company's economic evaluation could not be considered robust. After amendments to Celgene's model, the base-case ICER was A 273,308 pound per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was A 277,123 pound per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay of A 100,000 pound per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was less than 5 %. In all exploratory analyses conducted by the ERG, the ICER exceeded the NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold range of A 20,000-30,000 pound per QALY. Given the evidence provided in the submission, azacitidine did not fulfil NICE's end-of-life criteria. After considering the analyses performed by the ERG and submissions from clinician and patient experts, the NICE Appraisal Committee did not recommend azacitidine for this indication.","[Tikhonova, Irina A.; Hoyle, Martin W.; Snowsill, Tristan M.; Cooper, Chris; Varley-Campbell, Joanna L.; Mota, Ruben E.

We analyse the welfare losses due to suboptimal investment strategies and we find that investors who invest myopically, ignore derivative assets, model volatility by one factor and ignore stochastic covariance between asset returns can incur significant welfare losses.","[Escobar, Marcos; Ferrando, Sebastian] Ryerson Univ, Dept Math, George Vari Engn & Comp Ctr, 245 Church St, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rubtsov, Alexey] Ryerson Univ, Dept Math, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; Toronto Metropolitan University,"Rubtsov, A (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Dept Math, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON, Canada.",alexeyVrubtsov@gmail.com,"Escobar-Anel, Marcos/AAM-1507-2020; Escobar-Anel, Marcos/S-1225-2018","Escobar-Anel, Marcos/0000-0001-9691-4322;",,,,,36,17,21,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

When the correlation becomes strong, Kramer (1985, Journal of Econometrics 28, 363-370.) (for the Durbin-Watson test) and Kramer (2005, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 128, 489-496) (for the Cliff-Ord test) have shown that power can be very low, in fact can converge to zero, under certain circumstances. Motivated by these results, Martellosio (2010, Econometric Theory, 26, 152-186) set out to build a general theory that would explain these findings. Unfortunately, Martellosio (2010) does not achieve this goal, as a substantial portion of his results and proofs suffer from nontrivial flaws. The present paper now builds a theory as envisioned in Martellosio (2010) in an even more general framework, covering general invariant tests of a hypothesis on the disturbance covariance matrix in a linear regression model. The general results are then specialized to testing for spatial correlation and to autocorrelation testing in time series regression models. We also characterize the situation where the null and the alternative hypothesis are indistinguishable by invariant tests.","[Preinerstorfer, David; Poetscher, Benedikt M.] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Preinerstorfer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Stat, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",david.preinerstorfer@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Daouia and Simar (2007) used nonstandard conditional quantiles to address this problem, conditioning on Yy (Xx) in the output (input) orientation, but the resulting quantiles depend on the a priori chosen direction. This article uses a dimensionless transformation of the (p+q)-dimensional production process to develop an alternative formulation of distance from a realization of (X, Y) to the efficient support boundary, motivating a new, unconditional quantile frontier lying inside the joint support of (X, Y), but near the full, efficient frontier. The interpretation is analogous to univariate quantiles and corrects some of the disappointing properties of the conditional quantile-based approach. By contrast with the latter, our approach determines a unique partial-quantile frontier independent of the chosen orientation (input, output, hyperbolic, or directional distance). We prove that both the resulting efficiency score and its estimator share desirable monotonicity properties. Simple arguments from extreme-value theory are used to derive the asymptotic distributional properties of the corresponding empirical efficiency scores (both full and partial). The usefulness of the quantile-type estimator is shown from an infinitesimal and global robustness theory viewpoints via a comparison with the previous conditional quantile-based approach. A diagnostic tool is developed to find the appropriate quantile-order; in the literature to date, this trimming order has been fixed a priori. The methodology is used to analyze the performance of U.S. credit unions, where outliers are likely to affect traditional approaches.","[Daouia, Abdelaati] Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Simar, Leopold] Univ Cathol Louvain Neuve, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuaielles, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Clemson University; Clemson University,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.;Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",pww@clemson.edu,,,IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy; U.S. National Science Foundation [SMA-1243436]; Cyber Infrastructure Technology Integration group at Clemson University,IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cyber Infrastructure Technology Integration group at Clemson University,"Research support from IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy, from U.S. National Science Foundation (grant no.

Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for methods to identify multiple co-evolved residues. The n-dimensional Mutual Information (n DMI) method is introduced to identify co-evolution of multiple residues. This algorithm gains the co-evolution information of multiple residues from analysis of a matrix of MI values. The method was applied to G proteins. Results show that n DMI method is effective in identification of multiple co-evolved amino acids.

The test has power against general forms of nonlinearity in the jump dependence as well as temporal instabilities. We further propose an efficient estimator for the linear jump regression model that is formed by optimally weighting the detected jumps with weights based on the diffusive volatility around the jump times. We derive the asymptotic limit of the estimator, a semiparametric lower efficiency bound for the linear jump regression, and show that our estimator attains the latter. The analysis covers both deterministic and random jump arrivals. In an empirical application, we use the developed inference techniques to test the temporal stability of market jump betas.","[Li, Jia] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Todorov, Viktor] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Finance, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Tauchen, George] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Northwestern University; Duke University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",jl410@duke.edu; v-todorov@northwestern.edu; george.tauchen@duke.edu,"Todorov, Viktor/KCX-9394-2024","Todorov, Viktor/0000-0002-2360-7812","NSF [SES-1326819, SES-1530748]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank a co-editor and three anonymous referees for their thoughtful comments, which helped greatly improve the paper.

This paper proposes the construction of financial cycle measures for the US based on a large data set of macroeconomic and financial variables. More specifically, we estimate three synthetic financial cycle components that account for the majority of the variation in the data set using a dynamic factor model. We investigate whether these financial cycle components have significant predictive power for economic activity, inflation and short-term interest rates by means of Granger causality tests in a factor-augmented VAR set-up. Further, we analyze whether the synthetic financial cycle components have significant forecasting power for the prediction of economic recessions using dynamic probit models. Our main findings indicate that all financial cycle measures improve the quality of recession forecasts significantly. In particular, the factor related to financial market participants' uncertainty and risk aversion-related to Rey's (2013) global financial cycle-seems to serve as an appropriate early warning indicator for policymakers.","[Menden, Christian; Proano, Christian R.] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Menden, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany.",christian.menden@uni-bamberg.de,,"Proano, Christian/0000-0002-5148-7635",,,,,42,8,8,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

For such portfolio structures, plausibly arising in the context of reinsurance, he defines a distortion-type risk measure that facilitates assessment of ceded and net losses with reference to gross portfolio outcomes. Subsequently, Major (2018) derives explicit formulas for Euler allocations for this risk measure, thus (sub-)allocating ceded losses to the portfolio's original components. In this comment, we build on Major's (2018) insights but take a somewhat different direction, to consider Euler capital allocations for distortion risk measures directly applied to homogeneous portfolios.

A recent large randomized controlled trial compared the novel compound sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and found a 16% reduction in mortalityhazard. In Germany, sacubitril/valsartan was launched at the beginning of 2016.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to conduct a posthoc analysis of the cost effectiveness, budget impact, and disease burden reduction of sacubitril/valsartan compared with ACE inhibitors for patients with heart failure from the perspective of the German social health insurance (SHI), based on the results of this trial.MethodsA Markov (cohort) state transition model was constructed to simulate treatment over a remaining lifetime. Based on the Markov model, a dynamic population model was developed that projects the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and healthcare costs of heart failure in the SHI population from 2017 to 2060. The population model follows prevalent and incident cohorts over time. Each year a new cohort is added, while the existing cohorts age by 1year or die. To test for sensitivity of results, a Monte Carlo simulation was run.ResultsBased on the price negotiated between manufacturer and representatives of the SHI, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of sacubitril/valsartan versus ACE inhibitors is Euro23,401 per life-year gained (in 2018 Euros). At a price of zero, the cost-effectiveness ratio is already Euro9594 per life-year gained due to high background costs of heart failure. Annual budget impact and reduction of disease burden reach a maximum at 4-8years after launch (Euro221 million and 2.9%, respectively, in the base case).ConclusionsThe ICER of sacubitril/valsartan is projected to be at or below the level of other accepted interventions for the treatment of asymptomatic to severe heart failure in Germany. Projected budget impact leads to an increase in SHI expenditures by<0.04% per year.","[Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Adickesallee 32-34, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ostwald, Dennis A.] WifOR, Darmstadt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Gandjour, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Adickesallee 32-34, D-60322 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.gandjour@fs.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,Novartis Deutschland GmbH,Novartis Deutschland GmbH,This study was funded by Novartis Deutschland GmbH.,,45,22,24,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1285,1296,,10.1007/s40273-018-0688-4,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,30054868.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800010,0

We show that the Bermudan price is maximized when this continuation value is estimated near the exercise boundary, which is equivalent to implicitly estimating the optimal exercise boundary by using the value-matching condition. Localization is the key difference with respect to global regression methods, but is fundamental for optimal exercise decisions and requires estimation of the continuation value by iterating local least-squares (because we estimate and localize the exercise boundary at the same time). In the numerical example, in agreement with this optimality, the new prices or lower bounds (i) improve upon the prices reported by other methods and (ii) are very close to the associated dual upper bounds.

Objective The objective of this study was to develop a risk engine with multiple risk equations using a recent patient cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus reflective of the US population. Methods A total of 17 risk equations for predicting diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular events, hypoglycemia, mortality, and progression of diabetes risk factors were estimated using the data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial (n = 10,251). Internal and external validation processes were used to assess performance of the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) risk engine. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of risk factors on mortality at the population level. Results The BRAVO risk engine added several risk factors including severe hypoglycemia and common US racial/ethnicity categories compared with the UKPDS risk engine. The BRAVO risk engine also modeled mortality escalation associated with intensive glycemic control (i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin < 6.5%). External validation showed a good prediction power on 28 endpoints observed from other clinical trials (slope = 1.071, R-2 = 0.86). Conclusion The BRAVO risk engine for the US diabetes cohort provides an alternative to the UKPDS risk engine. It can be applied to assist clinical and policy decision making such as cost-effective resource allocation in USA.","[Shao, Hui; Stoecker, Charles; Liu, Shuqian; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Fonseca, Vivian] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, 1430 Tulane Ave, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University; Tulane University,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, 1440 Canal St,Suite 1900, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",lshi1@tulane.edu,,,,,,,40,55,55,0,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36.0,9,,,,,1125,1134,,10.1007/s40273-018-0662-1,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29725871.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439998500009,0

The pension fund is invested in both a risk-free asset and a risky asset. In particular, stochastic salary rates and the correlation between salary movements and financial market fluctuations are considered. Using the stochastic optimal control approach, we derive closed-form solutions for optimal investment strategies as well as optimal benefit payment adjustments, which minimize the combination of benefit risk (in terms of deviating from the target) and intergenerational transfers. Numerical analysis is presented to illustrate the sensitivity of the optimal strategies to parameters of the financial market and salary rates. We also consider how the optimal benefit changes with respect to different target levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Objective The purpose of this study is to present the newly developed French National Authority for Health (HAS) guidelines on budget impact analysis as follows: process, literature review, recommendations and comparisons with other guidelines. Methods The development process of the HAS guidelines included a literature review (search dates: January 2000 to June 2016), a retrospective investigation of BIA previously submitted to HAS, a public consultation, international expert reviews and approval from the HAS Board and the Economic and Public Health Evaluation Committee of HAS. Results Documents identified in the literature review included 12 national guidelines, 5 recommendations for good practices developed by national and international society of health economics and 14 methodological publications including recommendations for conducting BIA. Based on its research findings, HAS developed its first BIA guidelines, which include recommendations on the following topics: BIA definition, perspective, populations, time horizon, compared scenarios, budget impact models, costing, discounting, choice of clinical data, reporting of results and uncertainty exploration. Conclusion It is expected that the HAS BIA guidelines will enhance the usefulness, quality and transparency of BIA submitted by drug manufacturers to HAS.

Previous literature argues that the allocation of the portfolio measure to the financial derivative should take the usual special-case form of Aumann-Shapley, being a distortion weighted co-measure expectation. This is taken here as the definition of the distorted measure of the derivative with respect to the underlying portfolio. Due to homogeneity, the subsequent allocation of the derivative's value to the primitive elements of the portfolio again follows Aumann-Shapley, in the form of the exposure gradient of the distorted measure. However, the gradient in this case is seen to consist of two terms. The first is the familiar distorted expectation of the gradient of the financial derivative with respect to exposure to the element. The second term involves the conditional covariance of the financial derivative with the element. Sufficient conditions for this second term to vanish are provided. A method for estimating the second term in a simulation framework is proposed. Examples are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Network formation models present difficulties for identification, especially when links can be interdependent, for example, when indirect connections matter. We show how one can use the observed proportions of various local network structures to learn about the underlying preference parameters. The key assumption for our approach restricts individuals to have bounded degree in equilibrium, implying a finite number of payoff-relevant local structures. Our main result provides necessary conditions for parameters to belong to the identified set. We then develop a quadratic programming algorithm that can be used to construct this set. With further restrictions on preferences, we show that our conditions are also sufficient for pairwise stability and therefore characterize the identified set precisely. Overall, the use of both the economic model along with pairwise stability allows us to obtain effective dimension reduction.","[de Paula, Aureo] UCL, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Paula, Aureo] CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Richards-Shubik, Seth; Tamer, Elie] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; University College London; Lehigh University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"de Paula, A (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，CeMMAP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，IFS, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;de Paula, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",apaula@ucl.ac.uk; sethrs@lehigh.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448","NSF [SES-1123990]; ERC [338187]; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice [RES-589-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1, ES/I034021/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [338187] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor and five anonymous referees, along with seminar and conference participants at the Conference on Econometric Analysis of Social Interactions at Northwestern University (2010), the ASSA meetings in Chicago (2012), University of Western Ontario (2013), the Stats in Paris: Statistics and Econometrics of Networks (2013) conference, the Recent Advances in Set Identification (2013) conference, the 2nd European Meeting of Network Economics (2014), Heinz College (2015), the INET Econometrics of Networks Workshop at Cambridge University (2015), the Cowles Foundation (2015), Northwestern University (2015), the Chicago Fed (2015), the Econometric Society World Congress (2015), the USC Dornsife INET Conference on Networks (2015), the New York Fed (2016), the University of Pennsylvania (2016), Surrey (2016), Groningen (2016), the Tinbergen Institute (2016), Harvard (2016), Rutgers (2016), and Virginia (2016) for suggestions and comments.

One important challenge to existing research is how to describe the underlying asset price process and fluctuation features accurately. Considering the benefits of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) in depicting the fluctuation features of financial time series, we construct an option pricing model based on the new hybrid generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (hybrid GARCH)-type functions with improved EEMD by decomposing the original return series into the high frequency, low frequency and trend terms. Using the locally risk-neutral valuation relationship (LRNVR), we obtain an equivalent martingale measure and option prices with different maturities based on Monte Carlo simulations. The empirical results indicate that this novel model can substantially capture volatility features and it performs much better than the M-GARCH and Black-Scholes models. In particular, the decomposition is consistently helpful in reducing option pricing errors, thereby proving the innovativeness and effectiveness of the hybrid GARCH option pricing model.","[Hua, Qiuling; Cheng, Zhang] Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tingfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Tsinghua University,"Jiang, TF (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiangtf14@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Jiang, Tingfeng/M-7956-2019","Jiang, Tingfeng/0000-0001-5301-4826",Jilin University [2015QY020],Jilin University(Jilin University),"This work was supported by the Jilin University Research Funding (Designing Over the Counter Option of Agricultural Products and Risk Management-Based on the Perspective of Market Makers, NO. 2015QY020).",,30,3,3,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In multi-frequency finance various phenomena have been observed, such as shocks, crashes, volatility clustering, turbulent flows and contagion. Hawkes processes have been proposed to model those challenging phenomena appearing across asset prices in various exchanges. The original Hawkes process is an intensity-based model for series of events with path dependence and self-exciting or mutual-exciting mechanisms. This paper introduces a slightly depressing process to model the reverse phenomenon of self-exciting mechanisms. Such a process models the decline in the intensity of jumps observed in market regimes. The proposed birth-immigration-death process captures the decline in jump intensity observed at the start of a daily trading regime while the classical immigration-birth process models an increase in jump intensity towards the close of daily trading. Each of these processes can be expressed as a special case of a simple bivariate Hawkes process.","[Khashanah, Khaldoun] Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Chen, Jing] Cardiff Univ, Math Inst, Senghennydd Rd, Cardiff CF24 4AG, S Glam, Wales; [Hawkes, Alan] Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Bay Campus,Fabian Way, Swansea SA1 8EN, W Glam, Wales",Stevens Institute of Technology; Cardiff University; Swansea University,"Khashanah, K (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Financial Engn, 1 Castle Point Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",kkhashan@stevens.edu,,"Hawkes, Alan/0000-0003-0990-1772",,,,,36,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

High-risk women included those with locally advanced (including inflammatory) breast cancer and women with high-risk early-stage breast cancer (classified as T2/3 or N1). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the Evidence Review Group and the outcome of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. The clinical data were mainly taken from a phase II, randomised, open-label, active controlled study (NeoSphere), which reported a significant advantage in terms of pathological complete response rates of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, compared with trastuzumab alone with chemotherapy (45.8 vs. 29.0%, p = 0.0141). The company did not make any indirect comparisons. A meta-analysis of 12 neoadjuvant studies investigating the relationship between pathological complete response and event-free survival was used to extrapolate the outcomes reported in the NeoSphere study. A cardiac safety study (TRYPHAENA) demonstrated the safety of pertuzumab. The company undertook a model-based economic evaluation of neoadjuvant pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel over a lifetime horizon from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be A 20,104 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained for pertuzumab alongside trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with trastuzumab and docetaxel, which was revised to A 21,869 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained following the clarification process. The Evidence Review Group corrected an error in the digitisation of the survivor functions and modified the clinically inappropriate assumption that recurrence is zero after 7 years. The Evidence Review Group's probabilistic base case was A 23,962 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained. During the appraisal, to mitigate the uncertainties associated with the evidence, the company offered a patient access scheme, which led to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee recommending pertuzumab in this patient group, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the patient access scheme.","[Squires, Hazel; Pandor, Abdullah; Thokala, Praveen; Stevens, John W.; Kaltenthaler, Eva; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Coleman, Robert; Wyld, Lynda] Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol & Metab, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Squires, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",h.squires@sheffield.ac.uk,"Coleman, Robert/E-4346-2019; Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010; Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/69/11 STA]; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-1209-10071] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 15/69/11 STA).

The new methodology removes the non-negligible estimation effect of test statistic via a projection-based transformation, exploiting the nature of conditional moment specification testing. That is, the conditional moment restrictions, which are implicitly defined in conditional moment testing framework, not only imply the unconditional moment restrictions we are testing, but also many other unconditional moment restrictions. This approach is robust to departures from the distributional assumptions that are not being tested; moreover, only a preliminary root T-consistent estimator is needed, and the transformation is asymptotically distribution free. Furthermore, the transformed statistic reaches asymptotic efficiency in the sense of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. In some specific alternatives, we establish the optimal tests. We apply the methodology to test the adequacy and nonlinearity of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. Finally, an application to the S&P 500 daily data highlights the merits of our approach.","[Wang, Xuexin] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuexin] Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuexin] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Wang, XX (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",xuexinwang@xmu.edu.cn,,,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-31748]; 111 Project [B13028]; National Natural Science Funds of China [71301136],"Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Ref. no.

Previous studies have shown that the EM method produces a set with an accurate coverage ratio even for a small break; however, the set is often overly lengthy. This study proposes a simple modification to rehabilitate their method through the long-run variance estimation. Following the literature, we provide an asymptotic justification for the improvement of the modified method over the original method under a nonlocal asymptotic framework. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that the modified method achieves a shorter confidence set than the EM method, especially when the break is large or the HAC correction is conducted. The modified method may exhibit minor errors in the coverage rate when the break is small; however, the coverage is more stable than alternative methods when the break is large. We apply our method to a level shift in post-1980s Japanese inflation data.","[Yamamoto, Yohei] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Yamamoto, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",yohei.yamamoto@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"MEXT [25870235, 25285067, 25245042]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285067, 25245042, 25870235] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author acknowledges financial support for this work from the MEXT Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Nos. 25870235, 25285067, and 25245042.",,15,7,8,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

This study surveyed the implementation of MEAs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where limited comparative information is currently available. We conducted a survey on the implementation of MEAs in CEE between January and March 2017. Sixteen countries participated in this study. Across five countries with available data on the number of different MEA instruments implemented, the most common MEAs implemented were confidential discounts (n = 495, 73%), followed by paybacks (n = 92, 14%), price-volume agreements (n = 37, 5%), free doses (n = 25, 4%), bundle and other agreements (n = 19, 3%), and payment by result (n = 10, > 1%). Across seven countries with data on MEAs by therapeutic group, the highest number of brand names associated with one or more MEA instruments belonged to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)-L group, antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (n = 201, 31%). The second most frequent therapeutic group for MEA implementation was ATC-A, alimentary tract and metabolism (n = 87, 13%), followed by medicines for neurological conditions (n = 83, 13%). Experience in implementing MEAs varied substantially across the region and there is considerable scope for greater transparency, sharing experiences and mutual learning. European citizens, authorities and industry should ask themselves whether, within publicly funded health systems, confidential discounts can still be tolerated, particularly when it is not clear which country and party they are really benefiting. Furthermore, if MEAs are to improve access, countries should establish clear objectives for their implementation and a monitoring framework to measure their performance, as well as the burden of implementation.","[Ferrario, Alessandra; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, London, England; [Araja, Diana] Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Pharm, Minist Hlth, Fac Pharm, Riga, Latvia; [Bochenek, Tomasz] Jagiellonian Univ, Dept Drug Management, Fac Hlth Sci, Med Coll, PL-31531 Krakow, Poland; [Catic, Tarik] Soc Pharmacoecn & Outcomes Res Bosnia & Herzegovi, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Danko, David] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Dimitrova, Maria] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Org & Econ Pharm, Fac Pharm, 2 Dunav,Str, Sofia 1000, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Furst, Jurij] Hlth Insurance Inst Slovenia, Miklosiceva 24, Ljubljana 1507, Slovenia; [Greiciute-Kuprijanov, Ieva] Minist Hlth Republ Lithuania, Dept Pharm, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Hoxha, Iris] Univ Med Tirana, Dept Pharm, Fac Med, Tirana, Albania; [Jakupi, Arianit] Independent Consultant, Pristina, Kosovo; [Laidmae, Erki] Estonian Hlth Insurance Fund, Head Insurance Benefit Package, Tallinn, Estonia; [Loblova, Olga] Cent European Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Nadoru 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Mardare, Ileana] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Publ Hlth & Management Dept, Fac Med, Bucharest 1-3,Dr Leonte Anastasievici St, Bucharest 050463, Romania; [Markovic-Pekovic, Vanda] Minist Hlth & Social Welf, Banja Luka, Republic Of Srp, Bosnia & Herceg; [Markovic-Pekovic, Vanda] Univ Banja Luka, Med Fac, Dept Social Pharm, Mrkalja 18, Banja Luka, Republic Srpska, Bosnia & Herceg; [Meshkov, Dmitry] Natl Res Inst Publ Hlth, Moscow, Russia; [Novakovic, Tanja] Pharmaceut Assoc Serbia, Pharmacoecon Sect, Belgrade, Serbia; [Petrova, Guenka] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Social Pharm & Pharmacoecon, Fac Pharm, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Pomorski, Maciej] Agcy Hlth Technol Assessment & Tariff Syst AOTMiT, Krasickiego St, Warsaw, Poland; [Tomek, Dominik] Slovak Med Univ Bratislava, Fac Med, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Voncina, Luka] Independent Consultant, Zagreb, Croatia; [Haycox, Alan; Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Hlth Econ Ctr, Management Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Bonanno, Patricia Vella; Godman, Brian] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Univ, Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Hosp Huddinge, S-14186 Stockholm, Sweden",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Riga Stradins University; Jagiellonian University; Collegium Medicum Jagiellonian University; Corvinus University Budapest; Medical University Sofia; Central European University; Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy; University of Banja Luka (UNIBL); N.A.

More flexible approaches are needed to capture the characteristic I-O pattern of delayed treatment effects and, for a subset of patients, the plateau of long-term survival. Using a systematic approach to data management and analysis, the study assessed the applicability of traditional and flexible approaches and, as a test case of flexible methods, investigated the suitability of restricted cubic splines (RCS) to model progression-free survival (PFS) in I-O therapy. The goodness of fit of each survival function was tested on data from the CheckMate 067 trial of monotherapy versus combination therapy (nivolumab/ipilimumab) in metastatic melanoma using visual inspection and statistical tests. Extrapolations were validated using long-term data for ipilimumab. Modelled PFS estimates using traditional methods did not provide a good fit to the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve. RCS estimates fit the K-M curves well, particularly for the plateau phase. RCS with six knots provided the best overall fit, but RCS with one knot performed best at the plateau phase and was preferred on the grounds of parsimony. RCS models represent a valuable addition to the range of flexible approaches available to model survival when assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of I-O therapy. A systematic approach to data analysis is recommended to compare the suitability of different approaches for different diseases and treatment regimens.","[Gibson, Eddie; Koblbauer, Ian; Begum, Najida] Wickenstones Ltd, Oxford, England; [Dranitsaris, George] Augmentium Pharma Consulting Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Liew, Danny] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Monfared, Amir Abbas Tahami] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Monfared, Amir Abbas Tahami] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Yuan, Yong] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ USA; [Juarez-Garcia, Ariadna] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Tyas, David] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, London, England; [Lees, Michael] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Paris, France",Monash University; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; Bristol-Myers Squibb; McGill University; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Gibson, E (通讯作者)，Wickenstones Ltd, Oxford, England.",Eddie@wickenstones.com,"Monfared, Ali Shabestani/I-2441-2016","Tahami Monfared, Amir Abbas/0000-0003-4003-3192; Gibson, Eddie/0009-0008-3696-9792; Liew, Danny/0000-0002-0131-623X",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This research was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,31,43,46,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,12,,,,,1257,1270,,10.1007/s40273-017-0558-5,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FM8GP,28866758.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415324600005,0

To make the EQ-5D suitable for use in economic evaluations, a societal-based value set is needed. Indonesia does not have such a value set. The aim of this study was to derive an EQ-5D-5L value set from the Indonesian general population. A representative sample aged 17 years and over was recruited from the Indonesian general population. A multi-stage stratified quota method with respect to residence, gender, age, level of education, religion and ethnicity was utilized. Two elicitation techniques, the composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and discrete choice experiments (DCE) were applied. Interviews were undertaken by trained interviewers using computer-assisted face-to-face interviews with the EuroQol Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) platform. To estimate the value set, a hybrid regression model combining C-TTO and DCE data was used. A total of 1054 respondents who completed the interview formed the sample for the analysis. Their characteristics were similar to those of the Indonesian population. Most self-reported health problems were observed in the pain/discomfort dimension (39.66%) and least in the self-care dimension (1.89%). In the value set, the maximum value was 1.000 for full health (health state '11111') followed by the health state '11112' with value 0.921. The minimum value was -0.865 for the worst state ('55555'). Preference values were most affected by mobility and least by pain/discomfort. We now have a representative EQ-5D-5L value set for Indonesia. We expect our results will promote and facilitate health economic evaluations and HRQOL research in Indonesia.","[Purba, Fredrick Dermawan; Hunfeld, Joke A. M.; Busschbach, Jan J.

In this paper, we focus on the estimation of a Gaussian graphical model when the dependence between variables has a block-wise structure. We propose a penalized likelihood estimation of the inverse covariance matrix, also called Graphical LASSO, applied to block averages of observations, and we derive its asymptotic properties. Monte Carlo experiments, comparing the properties of our estimator with those of the conventional Graphical LASSO, show that the proposed approach works well in the presence of block-wise dependence structure and that it is also robust to possible model misspecification. We conclude the paper with an empirical study on economic growth and convergence of 1,088 European small regions in the years 1980 to 2012. While requiring a priori information on the block structure - e.g. given by the hierarchical structure of data - our approach can be adopted for estimation and prediction using very large panel data sets. Also, it is particularly useful when there is a problem of missing values and outliers or when the focus of the analysis is on out-of-sample prediction.","[Moscone, Francesco; Tosetti, Elisa] Brunel Univ London, Brunel Business Sch, Eastern Gateway Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Vinciotti, Veronica] Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, John Crank Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University; Brunel University,"Moscone, F (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Brunel Business Sch, Eastern Gateway Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",francesco.moscone@brunel.ac.uk; elisa.tosetti@brunel.ac.uk; veronica.vinciotti@brunel.ac.uk,"tosetti, elisa/ABD-1195-2020; Vinciotti, Veronica/A-7703-2008","tosetti, elisa/0000-0003-0979-2828; Vinciotti, Veronica/0000-0002-2625-7977","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant, Semantic Credit Risk Assessment of Business Ecosystems (SCRIBE); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L021250/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/L021250/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/G00160X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant, Semantic Credit Risk Assessment of Business Ecosystems (SCRIBE)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","F.

We focus on the setting where changes in health benefits, driven by medical inflation, are accounted for by an appropriate update or indexation of the level premium, the policy value, or both premium and policy value, during the term of the contract. Such an updating mechanism is necessary to restore the actuarial equivalence between future health benefits and surrender values on the one hand, and available policy values and future premiums on the other hand. We extend existing literature (Vercruysse et al., 2013; Denuit et al., 2017) by developing updating mechanisms in a discrete-time framework, where medical inflation is only taken into account ex-post as it emerges over time and where surrender values are allowed for. We propose and design two types of surrender values: based on the ageing provision on the one hand and based directly on the premiums paid until surrender on the other hand. We illustrate our updating strategy with numerical examples, using Belgian data, and investigate the sensitivity of our findings with respect to elements from the technical basis (in particular: the lapse rates) used in the actuarial calculations. Our updating mechanism is generic and useful for a wide range of products in life and health insurance, where some elements of the technical basis are guaranteed while others are subject to revision according to policy conditions.","[Dhaene, Jan; Godecharle, Els; Antonio, Katrien; Hanbali, Hamza] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Leuven, Belgium; [Antonio, Katrien] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Denuit, Michel] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Amsterdam; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Antonio, K (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Leuven, Belgium.;Antonio, K (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jan.dhaene@kuleuven.be; els.godecharle@kuleuven.be; k.antonio@uva.nl; michel.denuit@uclouvain.be; hamza.hanbali@kuleuven.be,"Dhaene, Jan/K-6178-2012; hanbali, hamza/AAK-8053-2021; Dhaene, Jan/I-9656-2019","Dhaene, Jan/0000-0003-4314-8809; hanbali, hamza/0000-0001-8060-4813;",,,,,15,5,5,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2017,47.0,3,,,,,803,836,,10.1017/asb.2017.13,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FE9ZW,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408563000006,0

We show that the ruin probability can be kept under control through the choice of the target level.

Theoretical justification for using the bootstrap technique to bias adjust log periodogram and semiparametric local Whittle estimators of the memory parameter is provided in the case where the true value of d lies in the range 0 <= d < 0.5. That the bootstrap method provides confidence intervals with the correct asymptotic coverage is also proven, with the intervals shown to adjust explicitly for bias, as estimated via the bootstrap. Simulation evidence comparing the performance of the bootstrap bias correction with analytical bias-correction techniques is presented.

Thus the models are referred to as generalized IV (GIV) models, but there are important cases in which instrumental variable restrictions play no significant role. Building on a definition of observational equivalence for incomplete models the development uses results from random set theory that guarantee that the characterizations deliver sharp bounds, thereby dispensing with the need for case-by-case proofs of sharpness. The use of random sets defined on the space of unobserved variables allows identification analysis under mean and quantile independence restrictions on the distributions of unobserved variables conditional on exogenous variables as well as under a full independence restriction. The results are used to develop sharp bounds on the distribution of valuations in an incomplete model of English auctions, improving on the pointwise bounds available until now. Application of many of the results of the paper requires no familiarity with random set theory.","[Chesher, Andrew] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Rosen, Adam M.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Social Sci 213, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA",University of London; University College London; Duke University,"Chesher, A (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",andrew.chesher@ucl.ac.uk; adam.rosen@duke.edu,,,"UK Economic and Social Research Council [RES-589-28-0001]; British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2009-StG-240910-ROMETA, ERC-2012-StG-312474]; ESRC [ES/I034021/1, ES/M010147/1, ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the co-editor and three anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions and feedback that helped to improve the paper.

We utilize a conditional measure of systemic risk that reflects market perceptions and can be intuitively interpreted as an entity's conditional joint probability of default, given the hypothetical default of other entities. The measure of systemic risk is applicable to high dimensions and not only incorporates individual default risk characteristics but also captures the underlying interdependent relations between sovereigns and banks in a multivariate setting. In empirical applications, our results reveal significant time variation in systemic risk spillover effects for the sovereign and banking system.

A simple scheme based on the log-normal distribution is developed and shown to be superior to the standard formula and to adjustments of the Cornish Fisher type. The method handles tail dependence if a simple Monte Carlo step is included. A hierarchical Clayton copula is constructed and used to confirm the accuracy of the log-normal approximation and to demonstrate the importance of including tail-dependence. Arguably a log-normal scheme makes the logic in Solvency II consistent, but many other distributions might be used as vehicle, a topic that may deserve further study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the TVOC model, half-rotated copulas are constructed to measure the nonlinear and asymmetric negative dependence, and the distribution-free test for independence is introduced to verify the dependent relationship and reduce the computational time. The TVOC model is then employed to research the dependence structure between security and commodity markets. We find evidence that the dependence structures across different markets vary over time and that emergencies are usually the major cause of sudden changes in the dependence structure. We also show that the TVOC model captures the dynamic characteristics of the direction and intensity of the dependence as well as the dynamic characteristics of the types of dependence structure. In particular, the half-rotated copulas can accurately describe the asymmetric negative extreme dependence across different markets.","[Liu, Bing-Yue] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Stat & Finance, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bing-Yue; Ji, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Beihang University","Ji, Q (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jqwxnjq@casipm.ac.cn,"Ji, Qiang/AAA-4001-2020; Ji, Qiang/AAY-1986-2021","Ji, Qiang/0000-0002-3502-5254;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91546109, 71133005, 71203210]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under [grant number 91546109], [grant number 71133005]; and [grant number 71203210] are acknowledged.",,35,56,57,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Two complementary strategies are pursued to evaluate the conditional distributions of consecutive TGARCH innovations, a non-parametric approach and a class of standardized copula distributions.

The proposed tests have very respectable power in comparison with the optimal tests for Markov-switching parameters of Carrasco et al.(2014), and they are also quite attractive owing to their computational simplicity.

We revisit his proposal by investigating Stein-like shrinkage in the context of two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation of a structural parameter. Our estimator follows Maasoumi(1978) in taking a weighted average of the 2SLS and ordinary least square estimators, with the weight depending inversely on the Hausman(1978) statistic for exogeneity. Using a local-to-exogenous asymptotic theory, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the Stein estimator and calculate its asymptotic risk. We find that if the number of endogenous variables exceeds 2, then the shrinkage estimator has strictly smaller risk than the 2SLS estimator, extending the classic result of James and Stein(1961). In a simple simulation experiment, we show that the shrinkage estimator has substantially reduced finite sample median squared error relative to the standard 2SLS estimator.","[Hansen, Bruce E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hansen, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",behansen@wisc.edu,"Hansen, Bruce E/AAZ-5224-2020",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Research supported by the National Science Foundation.

Several researches aimed at developing an expression for initiatives, which truly extend their value proposition to ecological and social horizons. This aspect has been referred as 'businesses for sustainability' in the past couple of years. However, despite the initial positive intentions, the expected outcomes seem to come undone in some cases. This paper presents a historic overview of principles developed by environmental economists. Furthermore, it introduces a case study for a novel environmental-based economic approach - the circular economy. The idea of circular economy has been neglected for a long time. Although, it is in governmental and corporate strategic plans by now, the case study proves the lack of appropriate practical background. The present study argues how the application of 'Transition management' appears to be essential in order to realize such a new economic paradigm.","[Horvath, Balint] Szent Istvan Univ, Climate Change Econ Res Ctr, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Magda, Robert] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Econ Law & Methodol, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Horvath, B (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Climate Change Econ Res Ctr, Pater Karoly St 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",horvath@carbonmanagement.hu; magda.robert@gtk.szie.hu,"Magda, Robert/HCH-0867-2022; Horvath, Balint/J-4020-2017","Horvath, Balint/0000-0001-5238-3320",,,,,35,1,1,0,5,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Indeed, to date, little attention has been paid to the possibility of considering the two together. To discuss the effect of the simultaneous inclusion of different dependence assumptions in ratemaking models, a bivariate INAR(1) regression model is adapted to the ratemaking problem of pricing an automobile insurance contract with two types of coverage, taking into account both the correlation between claims from different coverage types and the serial correlation between the observations of the same policyholder observed over time. A numerical application using an automobile insurance claims database is conducted and the main finding is that the improvement obtained with a BINAR(1) regression model, compared to the outcomes of the simplest models, is marked, implying that we need to consider both time and cross correlations to fit the data at hand. In addition, the BINAR(1) specification shows a third source of dependence to be significant, namely, cross-time dependence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Independent economic evaluation of these regimens simultaneously has not been conducted for the UK. Objective Using data from a network meta-analysis as efficacy measures, we estimated the cost effectiveness and cost utility of these regimens for the UK. Methods A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed-disease, and death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] gained and life-years [LYs]) was developed to estimate the incremental costutility (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for patients with MPC, from the payer perspective. The model was specified to calculate total costs in 2017 British pounds (GBP, ) pound. All values were discounted at 3.5% per year over a full lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty on the results. Results FFX was the most effective regimen, NAB-P + GEM was the most costly regimen, and GEM was the least costly and least effective regimen. OX + GEM, CIS + GEM, and NAB-P + GEM were dominated by CAP + GEM and FFX. Compared with GEM, the ICUR for CAP + GEM and FFX was 28,066 pound and 33,020 pound/QALY gained, respectively; compared with GEM, the ICER for CAP + GEM and FFX was 17,437 pound and 22,291 pound/LY gained, respectively; and compared with CAP + GEM, the ICUR and ICER for FFX were 34,947 pound/QALY gained and 24,414/LY gained, respectively. Conclusions At a threshold value of 30,000 pound/QALY, CAP + GEM was found to be the only cost-effective regimen in the management of MPC in the UK.","[Gharaibeh, Mahdi; Erstad, Brian; Slack, Marion; Alsaid, Nimer; Bootman, J.

The reporting quality of the included studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.ResultsA total of 72 studies were included in the review, classified as follows: medications for acute asthma treatment (n=5, 6.9%); inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) administered alone or in conjunction with long-acting -agonists (LABA) or tiotropium for chronic asthma treatment (n=38, 52.8%); direct comparisons between different combinations of ICS, ICS/LABA, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), and sodium cromoglycate for chronic asthma treatment (n=14, 19.4%); and omalizumab for chronic asthma treatment (n=15, 20.8%). ICS were reported to be cost effective when compared with LTRA for the management of persistent asthma. In patients with inadequately controlled asthma taking ICS, the addition of long-acting -agonist (LABA) preparations has been demonstrated to be cost effective, especially when combinations of ICS/LABA containing formoterol are used for both maintenance and reliever therapy. In patients with uncontrolled severe persistent allergic asthma, omalizumab therapy could be cost effective in a carefully selected subgroup of patients with the more severe forms of the disease. The quality of reporting in the studies, according to the CHEERS checklist, was very uneven. The main cost-effectiveness drivers identified were the cost or rate of asthma exacerbations, the cost or rate of the use of asthma medications, the asthma mortality risk, and the rate of utilization of health services for asthma.ConclusionsThe present findings are in line with the pharmacological recommendations for stepwise management of asthma given in the most recent evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the disease. The identified reporting quality of the available health economic evidence is useful for identifying aspects where there is room for improvement in future asthma cost-effectiveness studies.","[Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia; [Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E.] Univ El Bosque, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Pulmonol & Pediat Crit Care Med, Ave Cra 9 131A-02, Bogota, Colombia; [Sossa-Briceno, Monica P.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia; [Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Div Pediat, Ave Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad El Bosque; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Rodriguez-Martinez, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Colombia, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia.;Rodriguez-Martinez, CE (通讯作者)，Univ El Bosque, Sch Med, Dept Pediat Pulmonol & Pediat Crit Care Med, Ave Cra 9 131A-02, Bogota, Colombia.",carerodriguezmar@unal.edu.co,"Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./ABA-6591-2021; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./ABA-2760-2021","Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./0000-0002-0708-4281; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A./0000-0002-0708-4281; Rodriguez-Martinez, Carlos E./0000-0003-2560-6693",,,,,116,19,19,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1165,1200,,10.1007/s40273-018-0668-8,0.0,,,36,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29869050.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800004,0

Policy relevance and external validity turn on the ability to do this reliably. Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects. Since the weights are identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract information about the treatment parameter of interest from the IV estimand and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares estimands, among others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for compliers to the average effects for different or larger populations. Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain.","[Mogstad, Magne] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Stat Norway, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mogstad, Magne] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Santos, Andres] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Torgovitsky, Alexander] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago,"Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Stat Norway, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com; andres@econ.ucla.edu; torgovitsky@uchicago.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1530538, SES-1426882]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, four anonymous referees, Matt Masten, Derek Neal, Ed Vytacil, Chris Walters, and seminar participants at several universities and conferences for valuable feedback and suggestions.

Perspective UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic naive and biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Results In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other comparators were either below 10,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab. In biologic-experienced patients, the ICER for secukinumab versus CC was 4927 pound per QALY gained. Treatment response rates, short-term treatment effects, long-term radiographic progression and biologic acquisition costs were key model drivers. Scenario analysis found results to be robust to changes in model structural assumptions. Probabilistic analysis identified greater uncertainty in results in the biologic-naive population. Conclusions Even at list price, secukinumab appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients with active AS. Further research on long-term radiographic progression outcomes would be valuable for future cost-effectiveness analyses in AS.","[Emery, Paul; Marzo-Ortega, Helena] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Rheumat & Musculoskeletal Med, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Emery, Paul; Marzo-Ortega, Helena] Leeds Teaching Hosp NHS Trust, NIHR Leeds Biomed Res Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Van Keep, Marjolijn] BresMed Netherlands BV, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Beard, Steve] BresMed, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Chris; Miles, LaStella] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Jugl, Steffen Marc] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gunda, Praveen] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Hyderabad, India; [Halliday, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; Leeds Biomedical Research Centre; Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Novartis,"Halliday, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England.",anna.halliday@novartis.co,"emery, paul/B-3560-2013","Miles, LaStella/0000-0002-1394-070X; Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.",,23,14,15,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2018,36.0,8,,,,,1015,1027,,10.1007/s40273-018-0675-9,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GK9SK,29797186.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436593900012,0

Rifaximin is a non-systemic antibiotic that reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and overt HE-related hospitalizations. Objective Our objective was to provide an overview of the direct HE-related costs and cost benefits of rifaximin, lactulose, and rifaximin plus lactulose. Methods A systematic review of PubMed and relevant meeting abstracts was conducted to identify publications since 1 January 2007 reporting economic data related to HE and rifaximin and/or lactulose. Further, a public database and published literature were used to estimate current costs of hospitalization for overt HE, and potential cost savings of HE-related hospitalizations with rifaximin. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Drummond checklist. Results A total of 16 reports were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. Globally, HE-related direct costs ranged from $US5370 to $US50,120 annually per patient. Rifaximin was associated with shorter hospital stays and reduced healthcare costs. Rifaximin also has the potential to reduce overt HE-related hospitalization risk by 50% compared with lactulose. Rifaximin was shown to have a favourable pharmacoeconomic profile compared with lactulose (based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). Conclusions In addition to its clinical benefits (e.g. reduction in the risk of recurrence of overt HE, overt HE-related hospitalizations, favourable adverse event profile), economic data are favourable for the use of rifaximin in patients with a history of overt HE.","[Neff, Guy] Florida Digest Hlth Specialists, Florida Res Inst, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34211 USA; [Zachry, Woodie, III] Quantym Therapeut Data, Sarasota, FL USA",,"Neff, G (通讯作者)，Florida Digest Hlth Specialists, Florida Res Inst, Lakewood Ranch, FL 34211 USA.",guy.neff@fdhs.com,,,"Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ, USA","Technical editorial assistance was provided, under the direction of the authors, by Mary Beth Moncrief, PhD, and Sophie Bolick, PhD, Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, PA, USA.

The aim of this study was to consolidate the available evidence on the performance of both instruments. A systematic literature search of studies in the English and German languages was conducted (2007-January 2018) using the PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases, as well as the EuroQol Research Foundation website. Data were extracted and assessed on missing values, distributional properties, informativity indices (Shannon's H' and J'), inconsistencies, responsiveness, and test-retest reliability. Twenty-four studies were included in the review. Missing values and floor effects (percentage reporting the worst health state) were found to be negligible for both 3L and 5L (< 5%). From 18 studies, inconsistencies ranged from 0 to 10.6%, although they were generally well below 5%, with 9 studies reporting the most inconsistencies for Usual Activities (mean percentage 4.1%). Shannon's indices were always higher for 5L than for 3L, and all but three studies reported lower ceiling effects ('11111') for 5L than for 3L. There is mixed and insufficient evidence on responsiveness and test-retest reliability, although results on index values showed better performance for 5L on test-retest reliability. Overall, studies showed similar or better measurement properties of the 5L compared with the 3L, and evidence indicated moderately better distributional parameters and substantial improvement in informativity for the 5L compared with the 3L. Insufficient evidence on responsiveness and test-retest reliability implies further research is needed.","[Buchholz, Ines; Kohlmann, Thomas; Feng, You-Shan] Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Greifswald, Germany; [Janssen, Mathieu F.] Erasmus MC, Dept Med Psychol & Psychotherapy, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Greifswald Medical School; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC,"Buchholz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Med Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Greifswald, Germany.",ines.buchholz@uni-greifswald.de,"Buchholz, Dipl.-Psych., Dr. Ines/IVV-6400-2023","Buchholz, Dipl.-Psych., Dr. Ines/0000-0001-9729-6992; Feng, You-Shan/0000-0003-1509-3409",EuroQol Research Foundation [2016170],EuroQol Research Foundation,This work was funded by the EuroQol Research Foundation (grant number EQ Project 2016170).,,70,165,169,1,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2018,36.0,6,,,,,645,661,,10.1007/s40273-018-0642-5,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GG0LA,29572719.0,"Green Published, hybrid",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000432368700003,0

Our approach addresses various drawbacks associated with previous estimators proposed for this model. It allows for: general multiplicative heteroscedasticity in both selection and outcome equations; a nonparametric selection mechanism; and multiple discrete endogenous regressors. The resulting three-stage estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal, with a convergence rate that can be arbitrarily close to n-1/2 if certain smoothness assumptions are satisfied. Simulation results show that our estimator performs reasonably well in finite samples. Our approach is then used to study the intergenerational transmission of smoking habits in British households.","[Mu, Beili; Zhang, Zhengyu] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Mu, BL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",mubeili891101@163.com; zy.zhang@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [71501116]; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Innovation Fund of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [CXJJ-2015-354],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Innovation Fund of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,"The authors are grateful for the hard work and helpful comments provided by the editor Jaap Abbring and two anonymous referees.

In addition to irreversible bone erosions, joint destruction, and skin manifestations, psoriatic arthritis is associated with numerous comorbid conditions. Over the last 5 years, new treatments emerged; the analysis and comparisons of their additional costs and the added benefits have become increasingly important to optimize the limited resources available. Methods A systematic literature review covering PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed from May 2012 to October 2017 focusing on the most recent evidence of costs, benefits, and burden of psoriatic arthritis and its treatments. All economic evaluations assessing the burden of patients with psoriatic arthritis and written in English were eligible for inclusion. We also performed an assessment of the quality of the studies. Results Of the 1652 references found in the literature search, nine cost-effectiveness analyses and 12 cost-of-illness studies were included in the current review. Patients with psoriatic arthritis incur substantially higher direct and indirect costs, as compared with patients with psoriasis without arthritis or patients with other inflammatory diseases. The cost of treatment with biologic therapies is the major predictor of the total cost. However, individuals with psoriatic arthritis are also affected by substantial productivity losses and indirect costs. Biologic therapies are generally cost effective vs. conventional therapies (e.g., synthetic drugs) for treating psoriatic arthritis. Conclusions Psoriatic arthritis is associated with a significant economic burden and biologic therapies contribute significantly to these costs. Biologic therapies are more effective than disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for the symptoms and signs of psoriatic arthritis and for improving quality of life and inhibiting structural radiological damage. Therefore, biologic therapies are cost effective compared with conventional therapies: the increased direct cost associated with biologic drugs is offset by the significant improvement in the efficacy of treatments and in patient management of psoriatic arthritis.","[D'Angiolella, Lucia Sara; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo; Lafranconi, Alessandra; Micale, Mariangela; Mangano, Sveva; Cesana, Giancarlo; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni] Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Via G Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Mantovani, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Via G Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy.",l.dangiolella@campus.unimib.it; paolo.cortesi@unimib.it; alessandra.lafranconi@unimib.it; m.micale1@campus.unimib.it; s.mangano2@campus.unimib.it; giancarlo.cesana@unimib.it; lorenzo.mantovani@unimib.it,"Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/AAC-4263-2021; Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/AAD-7926-2020","Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/0000-0001-5241-4473; Lafranconi, Alessandra/0000-0002-4586-9610; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/0000-0003-3866-8199",,,,,32,33,34,4,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36.0,5,,,,,567,589,,10.1007/s40273-018-0618-5,0.0,,,23,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29441473.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430399300006,0

To identify these self-control types, I design an experiment in which the temptation was to read a story during a tedious task. The identification strategy relies on a two-step procedure. First, I measure commitment demand by eliciting subjects' preferences over menus that did or did not allow access to the story. I then implement preferences using a random mechanism, allowing to observe subjects who faced the choice yet preferred commitment. A quarter to a third of subjects can be classified as self-control types according to their menu preferences. When confronted with the choice, virtually all of them behaved as they anticipated and resisted temptation. These findings suggest that policies restricting the availability of tempting options could have larger welfare benefits than predicted by standard models of present bias.","[Toussaert, Severine] London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Toussaert, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England.",S.Toussaert@lse.ac.uk,,"Toussaert, Severine/0000-0002-2491-6713",,,,,57,40,49,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2018,86.0,3,,,,,859,889,,10.3982/ECTA14172,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GI0XJ,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434093400003,0

The literature mainly discusses pricing methods for American options that are based on Monte Carlo, tree and partial differential equation methods. We present an alternative approach that has become popular under the name de-Americanization in the financial industry. The method is easy to implement and enjoys fast run-times (compared to a direct calibration to American options). Since it is based on ad hoc simplifications, however, theoretical results guaranteeing reliability are not available. To quantify the resulting methodological risk, we empirically test the performance of the de-Americanization method for calibration. We classify the scenarios in which de-Americanization performs very well.

We show that indices like the Gini index, especially when restricted to the tails by conditioning and truncation, give us an accurate way of assessing the variability of the larger losses - the most relevant ones - and the reliability of common risk management measures like the Expected Shortfall. We first present the Concentration Profile, which is formed by a sequence of truncated Gini indices, to characterize the loss distribution, providing interesting information about tail risk. By combining Concentration Profiles and standard results from utility theory, we develop the Concentration Map, which can be used to assess the risk attached to potential losses on the basis of the risk profile of a user, her beliefs and historical data. Finally, with a sequence of truncated Gini indices as weights for the Expected Shortfall, we define the Concentration Adjusted Expected Shortfall, a measure able to capture additional features of tail risk.

Measuring CVA requires combining models of market and credit risk to estimate a counterparty's risk of default together with the market value of exposure to the counterparty at default. Wrong-way risk refers to the possibility that a counterparty's likelihood of default increases with the market value of the exposure. We develop a method for bounding wrong-way risk, holding fixed marginal models for market and credit risk and varying the dependence between them. Given simulated paths of the two models, a linear program computes the worst-case CVA. We analyze properties of the solution and prove convergence of the estimated bound as the number of paths increases. The worst case can be overly pessimistic, so we extend the procedure by constraining the deviation of the joint model from a baseline reference model. Measuring the deviation through relative entropy leads to a tractable convex optimization problem that can be solved through the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Here, too, we prove convergence of the resulting estimate of the penalized worst-case CVA and the joint distribution that attains it. We consider extensions with additional constraints and illustrate the method with examples.","[Glasserman, Paul; Yang, Linan] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Glasserman, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pg20@columbia.edu,,,,,,,39,11,12,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

In 2009, Revicki et al. mapped the PROMIS-GH items to EQ-5D-3L utilities using linear regression (REVReg). More recently, regression was shown to be ill-suited for mapping to preference-based measures due to regression to the mean. Linear and equipercentile equating are alternative mapping methods that avoid the issue of regression to the mean. Another limitation of the prior models is that ordinal predictors were treated as continuous. Using data collected from the PROMIS Wave 1 sample, we refit REVReg, treating the PROMIS-GH items as categorical variables (CAT(Reg)). We applied linear and equipercentile equating to the REVReg model (REVLE, REVequip) and the CAT(Reg) model (CAT(LE), CAT(equip)). We validated and compared the predictive accuracy of these models in a large sample of neurological patients at a single tertiary-care hospital. In the neurological disease patient sample, CAT(LE) produced the strongest correlations between estimated and observed EQ-5D-3L scores and had the lowest mean squared error. The CAT(equip) model had the lowest mean absolute error and had estimated scores that best matched the overall distribution of observed scores. Using linear and equipercentile equating, we created new models mapping PROMIS-GH items to EQ-5D-3L utility scores. EQ-5D-3L utility scores can be more accurately estimated using our models for use in cost-effectiveness studies or studies examining overall health-related quality of life.","[Thompson, Nicolas R.; Lapin, Brittany R.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Quantitat Hlth Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Thompson, Nicolas R.; Lapin, Brittany R.; Katzan, Irene L.] Cleveland Clin, Neurol Inst, Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, 9500 Euclid Ave,JJN3-1, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Thompson, NR (通讯作者)，Cleveland Clin, Dept Quantitat Hlth Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Thompson, NR (通讯作者)，Cleveland Clin, Neurol Inst, Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, 9500 Euclid Ave,JJN3-1, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",thompsn@ccf.org,"Katzan, Irene/HTN-4182-2023","Lapin, Brittany/0000-0002-4314-2282",Neurological Institute Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation,Neurological Institute Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation,The authors thank the Neurological Institute Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation for supporting this study.,,27,30,32,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2017,35.0,11,,,,,1167,1176,,10.1007/s40273-017-0541-1,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FK9WZ,28710740.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413863900006,0

In this paper, we extend a large-network-based game model to a model that allows for the dependence of social interactions on social-influence status. In particular, we use the Katz-Bonacich centrality to measure individuals' social influences, which are obtained directly from the observation of a social network. To solve the computational burden when the data come from the equilibrium of a large network, we extend a nested pseudo-likelihood estimation approach to our large-network-based game model. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) dataset, we investigate the peer effects of dangerous behaviour among high-school students. Our results show that the peer effects are statistically significant and positive. Moreover, students benefit more (statistically significant at the 5% level) from conformity or, equivalently, pay more for disobedience, in terms of peer pressure, if their friends have a higher status of social influence.","[Lin, Zhongjian] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Room 332,Rich Mem Bldg, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Xu, Haiqing] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Stn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Emory University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Lin, ZJ (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Room 332,Rich Mem Bldg, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",zhongjian.lin@emory.edu; h.xu@austin.utexas.edu,,,Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR); Carolina Population Center of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR); Carolina Population Center of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,"A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title 'Identification and estimation of hierarchy effects in social interactions'.

These can only be estimated in a reliable way from a sufficiently large historical dataset for such portfolios, which is often not available. We overcome this problem by introducing a model to estimate portfolio-specific mortality simultaneously with population mortality. By using a Bayesian framework, we automatically generate the appropriate weighting for the limited statistical information in a given portfolio and the more extensive information that is available for the whole population. This allows us to separate parameter uncertainty from uncertainty due to the randomness in individual deaths for a given realization of mortality rates. When we apply our method to a dataset of assured lives in England and Wales, we find that different prior specifications for the portfolio-specific factors lead to significantly different posterior distributions for hazard rates. However, in short-term predictive distributions for future numbers of deaths, individual mortality risk turns out to be more important than parameter uncertainty in the portfolio-specific factors, both for large and for small portfolios.","[van Berkum, Frank; Antonio, Katrien; Vellekoop, Michel] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Antonio, Katrien] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Leuven, Belgium",University of Amsterdam; KU Leuven,"van Berkum, F (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.vanberkum@uva.nl,,"van Berkum, Frank/0000-0003-0968-0367","Netspar, the Network for Studies on Pensions, Ageing and Retirement","Netspar, the Network for Studies on Pensions, Ageing and Retirement","The authors gratefully thank CMI for making the dataset on assured lives in the UK used in this paper publicly available on their website.

Our results show that different types of data breaches need to be modeled as distinct risk categories. For severity modeling, the log-skew-normal distribution provides promising results. The findings add to the recent discussion on the use of skewed distributions in actuarial modeling (Vernic, 2006; Bolance et al., 2008; Eling, 2012).

However, there are ongoing concerns with the credibility of models. Modelling methods guidance can encourage good practice within model development, but its value is dependent on its ability to address the areas that modellers find most challenging. Further, it is important that modelling methods and related guidance are continually updated in light of any new approaches that could potentially enhance model credibility. The objective of this article was to highlight the ways in which qualitative methods have been used and recommended to inform decision-analytic model development and enhance modelling practices. With reference to the literature, the article discusses two key ways in which qualitative methods can be, and have been, applied. The first approach involves using qualitative methods to understand and inform general and future processes of model development, and the second, using qualitative techniques to directly inform the development of individual models. The literature suggests that qualitative methods can improve the validity and credibility of modelling processes by providing a means to understand existing modelling approaches that identifies where problems are occurring and further guidance is needed. It can also be applied within model development to facilitate the input of experts to structural development. We recommend that current and future model development would benefit from the greater integration of qualitative methods, specifically by studying 'real' modelling processes, and by developing recommendations around how qualitative methods can be adopted within everyday modelling practice.","[Husbands, Samantha; Coast, Joanna] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Jowett, Susan; Barton, Pelham] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Bristol; University of Birmingham,"Husbands, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",Samantha.husbands@bristol.ac.uk,"Jowett, Sue/AAO-4198-2021","Jowett, Sue/0000-0001-8936-3745; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166",University of Birmingham,University of Birmingham,The preparation of this review was in part funded by a college studentship obtained by Samantha Husbands through the University of Birmingham.,,38,16,20,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2017,35.0,6,,,,,607,612,,10.1007/s40273-017-0499-z,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EU8XA,28321640.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401320600001,0

It consists in constructing a lower bound on the size of approximation errors. A small lower bound on errors is a necessary condition for accuracy: If a lower error bound is unacceptably large, then the actual approximation errors are even larger, and hence, the approximation is inaccurate. Our lower-bound error analysis is complementary to the conventional upper-error (worst-case) bound analysis, which provides a sufficient condition for accuracy. As an illustration of our methodology, we assess approximation in the first- and second-order perturbation solutions for two stylized models: a neoclassical growth model and a new Keynesian model. The errors are small for the former model but unacceptably large for the latter model under some empirically relevant parameterizations.","[Judd, Kenneth L.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Off 344, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Judd, Kenneth L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Maliar, Lilia] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Off 142, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Maliar, Lilia] Univ Alicante, Dept Econ, Second Floor,Off 7,Campus San Vicente, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Maliar, Serguei] Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Lucas Hall,Off 316J,500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; Universitat d'Alacant; Santa Clara University,"Judd, KL (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Off 344, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Judd, KL (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kenneth.judd@gmail.com; maliarl@stanford.edu; smaliar@scu.edu,,,"Hoover Institution; Department of Economics at Stanford University; Santa Clara University, Ivie; University of Alicante; MINECO/FEDER [ECO2015-70540-P]","Hoover Institution; Department of Economics at Stanford University; Santa Clara University, Ivie; University of Alicante; MINECO/FEDER(Spanish Government)","We thank the editor and four anonymous referees for many thoughtful comments and suggestions.

The impact of informal care can be measured and valued with the CarerQol instrument, which measures the impact of informal care on seven important burden dimensions (CarerQol-7D) and values this in terms of general quality of life (CarerQol-VAS). The CarerQol can be included at the effect side of multi-criteria analyses of patient interventions or in cost-effectiveness or utility analysis of interventions targeted at caregivers. Objective At present, utility scores based on relative utility weights for the CarerQol-7D are only available for the Netherlands. This study calculates CarerQol-7D tariffs for Australia, Germany, Sweden, UK, and US. Methods Data were collected among the general population in Australia, Germany, Sweden, UK, and US by an Internet survey. Utility weights were collected with a discrete choice experiment with two unlabeled alternatives described in terms of the seven CarerQol-7D dimensions. An efficient experimental design with priors obtained from the Netherlands was used to create the choice sets. Data was analyzed with a panel mixed multinomial logit model with random parameters. Results In all five countries, the CarerQol-7D dimensions were significantly associated with the utility of informal care situations. Physical health problems were most strongly associated with the utility for informal care situations. The tariff was constructed by adding up the relative utility weights per category of all CarerQol-7D dimensions for each country separately. Conclusion The CarerQol tariffs for Australia, Germany, Sweden, UK, and US facilitate the inclusion of informal care in economic evaluations.","[Hoefman, Renske J.] Netherlands Inst Hlth Serv Res, POB 1568, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hoefman, Renske J.; van Exel, Job; Brouwer, Werner B.

We impose no assumption on the distribution of the missing data and we confront the missing data problem by using a worst case scenario approach. We characterize the sharp identified set and argue that this set is usually too complex to compute or to use for inference. Given this difficulty, we consider the construction of outer identified sets (i.e. supersets of the identified set) that are easier to compute and can still characterize the parameter of interest. Two different outer identification strategies are proposed. Both of these strategies are shown to have nontrivial identifying power and are relatively easy to use and combine for inferential purposes.","[Aucejo, Esteban M.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Bugni, Federico A.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Hotz, V.

In addition to the participation in equity investments, the majority of variable annuity products in today's market offer various types of investment guarantees, protecting policyholders from the downside risk of their investments. One of the most popular investment guarantees is known as the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB). In current market practice, the development of hedging portfolios for such a product relies heavily on Monte Carlo simulations, as there were no known closed-form formulas available in the existing actuarial literature. In this paper, we show that such analytical solutions can in fact be determined for the risk-neutral valuation and delta-hedging of the plain-vanilla GLWB. As we demonstrate by numerical examples, this approach drastically reduces run time as compared to Monte Carlo simulations. The paper also presents a novel technique of fitting exponential sums to a mortality density function, which is numerically more efficient and accurate than the existing methods in the literature.

Since liquid market prices are only available for options on commodity futures, rather than forwards, a convexity correction formula for the model is derived to account for the difference between forward and futures prices. A procedure for efficiently calibrating the model to interest rate and commodity volatility smiles is constructed. Finally, the model is fitted to an exogenously given correlation structure between forward interest rates and commodity prices (cross-correlation). When calibrating to options on forwards (rather than futures), the fitting of cross-correlation preserves the (separate) calibration in the two markets (interest rate and commodity options), while in the case of futures a (rapidly converging) iterative fitting procedure is presented. The fitting of cross-correlation is reduced to finding an optimal rotation of volatility vectors, which is shown to be an appropriately modified version of the orthonormal Procrustes' problem in linear algebra. The calibration approach is demonstrated in an application to market data for oil futures.","[Karlsson, P.] ING Bank, Quantitat Analyt, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Pilz, K.

One of the tools widely utilized is stochastic factor analysis on a set of correlated time-series (e.g. asset returns). Published time-series factor models require either sufficiently wide time windows of observed data or numeric solutions by simulations. We developed a 'variational sequential Bayesian factor analysis' (VSBFA) algorithm to make online learning of time-varying stochastic factor structure. The VSBFA is an analytic filter to estimate unknown factor scores, factor loadings and residual variances. The covariance matrix of the time-series predicted by the VSBFA can be decomposed into loadings-based covariance and specific variances, and the former can be expressed by 'explanatory factors' such as systematic components of various financial market indices. We compared the VSBFA with the most practiced factor model relying on wide data windows, the rolling PCA (principal components analysis), by applying them to 9-year daily returns of 200 simulated stocks with the 'true' daily data-generating model completely known, and by using them to forecast volatilities of long-only and long/short global stock portfolios with 25-year monthly returns of more than 800 stocks worldwide. Accuracy of the forecast covariance matrices is measured by a (symmetrized) Kullback-Leibler distance, and accuracy of the forecast portfolio volatilities is measured by bias statistic, log-likelihood, Q-statistic, and portfolio volatility minimization. The factor-based covariance and specific variances predicted by the best VSBFA are significantly more accurate than those by the best rolling PCA.","[Ling, Hui 'Fox'] Allianz Global Investors US LLC, 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 USA; [Franzen, Christian] Allianz Global Investors GmbH, Bockenheimer Landstr 42-44, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Ling, H (通讯作者)，Allianz Global Investors US LLC, 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 USA.",fox.ling@allianzgi.com,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The reforms allow personnel in colleges and universities to realize their self-fulfillment in various fields and lay a solid intellectual foundation for national economic development. As a totally new teaching model, web-based teaching, which is flexible and intuitive, is built on technologies such as data and Internet. It can change the dull and monotonous model of teaching into vivid ones and arouse students' interests in participating, thinking and exploring, in order to enhance the effectiveness of personnel training in colleges and universities. Starting from the development history of web-based teaching and personnel training, this paper analyzes the opportunities and challenges, which Internet technology and education might confront, and then specifically introduces the existing web-based teaching methods.

First, empirical data are often characterized by time-varying volatility and fat tails; therefore, we use Gaussian generalized autoregressive score (GAS) and GARCH models, extending them to Student's t-GARCH and t-GAS. Second, an important risk (reservoir size) is not hedgeable. As a result, markets are incomplete which makes preference free pricing impossible and thus standard option pricing methodology inapplicable. Therefore, we parametrize the investor's risk preference and use utility indifference pricing techniques. We use Least Squares Monte Carlo simulations as a dimension reduction technique in solving the resulting stochastic dynamic programming problems. Moreover, an investor often only has an approximate idea of the true probabilistic model underlying variables, making model ambiguity a relevant problem. We show empirically how model ambiguity affects project values, and importantly, how option values change as model ambiguity gets resolved in later phases of the projects. We show that traditional valuation approaches will consistently underestimate the value of project flexibility and in general lead to overly conservative investment decisions in the presence of time-dependent stochastic structures.","[van Wijnbergen, Sweder] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam,"van Wijnbergen, S (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.j.g.vanwijnbergen@uva.nl,,,"EBN B.V., the Netherlands","EBN B.V., the Netherlands","This work was supported by EBN B.V., the Netherlands.",,39,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We use a field experiment and a structural model to study how plant emission standards are enforced. In collaboration with an Indian environmental regulator, we experimentally doubled the rate of inspection for treatment plants and required that the extra inspections be assigned randomly. We find that treatment plants only slightly increased compliance. We hypothesize that this weak effect is due to poor targeting, since the random inspections in the treatment found fewer extreme violators than the regulator's own discretionary inspections. To unbundle the roles of extra inspections and the removal of discretion over what plants to target, we set out a model of environmental regulation where the regulator targets inspections, based on a signal of pollution, to maximize plant abatement. Using the experiment to identify key parameters of the model, we find that the regulator aggressively targets its discretionary inspections, to the degree that half of the plants receive fewer than one inspection per year, while plants expected to be the dirtiest may receive ten. Counterfactual simulations show that discretion in targeting helps enforcement: inspections that the regulator assigns cause three times more abatement than would the same number of randomly assigned inspections. Nonetheless, we find that the regulator's information on plant pollution is poor, and improvements in monitoring would reduce emissions.","[Duflo, Esther] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Greenstone, Michael] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pande, Rohini] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ryan, Nicholas] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago; Harvard University; Yale University,"Duflo, E (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",eduflo@mit.edu; mgreenst@uchicago.edu; rohini_pande@harvard.edu; nicholas.ryan@yale.edu,,,"Sustainability Science Program (SSP); Harvard Environmental Economics Program; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR); International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie); National Science Foundation (NSF) [1066006]; International Growth Centre (IGC); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1066006] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Sustainability Science Program (SSP); Harvard Environmental Economics Program; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR); International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); International Growth Centre (IGC); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Sanjiv Tyagi, R.

We put forward a general model for this setting, which is a natural generalization of anonymous hedonic games. We then focus on a special case of our model where agents' preferences are binary, i.e., each agent classifies all pairs of the form (activity, group size)' into ones that are acceptable and ones that are not.

We consider 3327 data breach events from 2005 to 2016 and identify a significant asymmetric dependence of monthly losses in two cross-sectional settings: cross-industry losses in four categories by breach types (hacking, lost electronic device, unintended disclosure and insider breach) and cross-breach type losses in five categories by industries (banking and insurance, government, medical service, retail/other business and educational institution). To identify the method that best fits the dependence structure of the dataset, we implement copula modeling by separating the dependence into pairwise non-zero losses and zero loss arrivals. We model the former by pair copula construction (PCC) allowing for the flexible choice of copula functions, whereas the latter is modeled by Gaussian copula. We illustrate the usefulness of our results in two applications to risk measurement and pricing. Our findings are important for risk managers and actuaries who are designing cyber-insurance policies.

Our framework is well suited for updating projections when newly available data arrives, and for dealing with edge issues where credibility is lower. We present a detailed analysis of GP model performance for US mortality experience based on the CDC (Center for Disease Control) datasets.

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the appropriate use of data on clinical effectiveness in cost-effectiveness modeling studies that were published between 2001 and 2015. Methods Assessors rated 72 modeling studies obtained from three therapeutic areas by applying criteria defined by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation group for assessing the quality of clinical evidence: selection of clinical data (publication bias), imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency (i.e., heterogeneity), and study limitations (risk of bias). For all parameters included in the analyses, potential changes over time were assessed. Results Although three out of four modeling studies relied on randomized controlled trials, more than 60% of the modeling studies were based on clinical data with a high or unclear risk of bias, in more than 80%, a risk of publication bias was found, and in about 30%, evidence was based on indirect clinical evidence, having significantly increased over the years. Study limitations were inadequately described in more than one third of the studies. However, less than 10% of clinical studies showed inconsistency or imprecision in study results. Conclusion Despite the fact that the majority of economic evaluations are based on precise and consistent randomized controlled trials, their results are often affected by limitations arising from methodological shortcomings in the underlying data on clinical efficacy. Modelers and assessors should be more aware of aspects surrounding the quality of clinical evidence as considered by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation group.","[Mensch, Alexander] Janssen Cilag GmbH, Johnson & Johnson Pl 1, D-41470 Neuss, Germany; [Beck, Tanja; Civello, Daniele; Kunigkeit, Christopher; Lachmann, Nicole; Stock, Stephanie; Mueller, Dirk] Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, Cologne, Germany; [Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Johnson & Johnson; University of Cologne; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Müller, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Cologne AoR, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, Cologne, Germany.",dirk.mueller@uk-koeln.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019","Muller, Dirk/0000-0002-5576-0192",,,,,27,5,5,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2018,36.0,8,,,,,987,994,,10.1007/s40273-018-0651-4,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GK9SK,29808254.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436593900009,0

The stochastic volatility is a square root process, which is widely used for modeling the behavior of the variance process (Heston model). The local volatility part is of general form, requiring only appropriate growth and boundedness assumptions. We rigorously establish tight error estimates of our expansions, using Malliavin calculus. The error analysis, which requires a careful treatment because of the lack of weak differentiability of the model, is interesting on its own. Moreover, in the particular case of call-put options, we also provide expansions of the Black-Scholes implied volatility that allow to obtain very simple formulas that are fast to compute compared to the Monte Carlo approach and maintain a very competitive accuracy.","[Gobet, E.] Ecole Polytech, CMAP, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Gobet, E.] CNRS, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Gobet, E (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, CMAP, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.;Gobet, E (通讯作者)，CNRS, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",emmanuel.gobet@polytechnique.edu,,,,,,,38,4,4,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

A regime-switching model is considered for the dynamics of market assets. The approach is based on a local optimization of risk and is therefore very tractable and flexible. The local optimization criterion is itself optimized to minimize capital requirements associated with the variable annuity policy, the latter being quantified by the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) risk metric. In comparison to benchmarks, our method is successful in simultaneously reducing capital requirements and increasing profitability. Indeed the proposed local hedging scheme benefits from a higher exposure to equity risk and from time diversification of risk to earn excess return and facilitate the accumulation of capital. A robust version of the hedging strategies addressing model risk and parameter uncertainty is also provided.","[Trottier, Denis-Alexandre] Univ Laval, Fac Sci Adm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Godin, Frederic] Concordia Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Godin, Frederic; Hamel, Emmanuel] Univ Laval, Ecole Actuariat, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Concordia University - Canada; Laval University,"Godin, F (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Godin, F (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ecole Actuariat, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",denis-alexandre.trottier.1@ulaval.ca; frederic.godin@concordia.ca; emmanuel.hamel.1@ulaval.ca,"Godin, Frédéric/HKE-8203-2023",,Education and Good Governance Fund of l'Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF Quebec); FRQNT [2017-NC-197517]; NSERC [RGPIN-2017-06837],Education and Good Governance Fund of l'Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF Quebec); FRQNT(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies (FRQNT)); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"Financial support from the Education and Good Governance Fund of l'Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF Quebec), FRQNT (Godin, 2017-NC-197517) and NSERC (Godin, RGPIN-2017-06837) is gratefully acknowledged.

Our main assumption is that the regression function is known to lie in a convex function class, which covers most smoothness and/or shape assumptions used in econometrics. We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic results when the error distribution is not known. When the function class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs are close to efficient at smooth regression functions. This implies, in particular, that it is impossible to form CIs that are substantively tighter using data-dependent tuning parameters, and maintain coverage over the whole function class.

For this aim, we rely on a quadratic exponential model in which the association between the response variables is accounted for in a different way with respect to more standard formulations. The level of association is measured by a single parameter that may be estimated by a Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) approach. Under the dynamic logit model, the conditional estimator of this parameter converges to zero when the hypothesis of absence of state dependence is true. Therefore, it is possible to implement a t-test for this hypothesis which may be very simply performed and attains the nominal significance level under several structures of the individual covariates. Through an extensive simulation study, we find that our test has good finite sample properties and it is more robust to the presence of (autocorrelated) covariates in the model specification in comparison with other existing testing procedures for state dependence. The proposed approach is illustrated by two empirical applications: the first is based on data coming fromthe Panel Study of Income Dynamics and concerns employment and fertility; the second is based on the Health and Retirement Study and concerns the self reported health status.","[Bartolucci, Francesco; Pigini, Claudia] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy; [Nigro, Valentina] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",University of Perugia; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Bartolucci, F (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy.",francesco.bartolucci@unipg.it,"Bartolucci, Francesco/J-7877-2012","Bartolucci, Francesco/0000-0001-7057-1421","Italian Government [RBFR12SHVV]; National Institutes of Health [R01 HD069609]; National Science Foundation [1157698]; National Institute on Aging [NIA U01AG009740]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Italian Government; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Francesco Bartolucci and Claudia Pigini acknowledge the financial support from the grant RBFR12SHVV of the Italian Government (FIRB project Mixture and latent variablemodels for causal inference and analysis of socio-economic data).

We analyse the existence of solutions to the problem under general assumptions. When the short positions are not constrained, we establish a lower bound on the cost of risk associated with optimizing the mean-standard deviation model and show that optimal solutions do not exist for any positive price of risk which is smaller than that bound. If the investment allocations are constrained, then we obtain a lower bound on the price of risk in terms of the shadow prices of said constraints and the data of the problem. A Value-at-Risk constraint in the model implies an upper bound on the price of risk for all feasible portfolios. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which using this upper bound as the cost of risk parameter in the model provides a non-dominated optimal portfolio with respect to the second-order stochastic dominance. Additionally, we study the relationship between minimizing the mean-standard deviation objective and maximizing the coefficient of variation and show that both problems are equivalent when the upper bound is used as the cost of risk. Additional relations between the Value-at-Risk constraint and the coefficient of variation are discussed as well.

The classical stochastic frontier model often suffers from the empirical artefact that the residuals of the production function may have a positive skewness, whereas a negative one is expected under the model, which leads to estimated full efficiencies of all firms. We propose a new approach to the problem by generalizing the distribution used for the inefficiency variable. This generalized stochastic frontier model allows the sample data to have the wrong skewness while estimating well-defined and nondegenerate efficiency measures. We discuss the statistical properties of the model, and we discuss a test for the symmetry of the error term (no inefficiency). We provide a simulation study to show that our model delivers estimators of efficiency with smaller bias than those of the classical model even if the population skewness has the correct sign. Finally, we apply the model to data of the U.S. textile industry for 1958-2005 and show that for a number of years our model suggests technical efficiencies well below the frontier while the classical one estimates no inefficiency in those years.","[Hafner, Christian M.; Simar, Leopold] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Actuarial Sci, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Manner, Hans] Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr & Stat, Cologne, Germany",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Cologne,"Hafner, CM (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Actuarial Sci, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.;Hafner, CM (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",christian.hafner@uclouvain.be,"Manner, Hans/IYS-1311-2023","Manner, Hans/0000-0002-3334-4251",,,,,19,17,17,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Since we observe the empirical data at daily frequency and only for a finite number of time-to-maturity buckets, we propose a modelling framework which is inherently discrete. In particular, we show how to approximate the HJM continuous time description of the multi-curve dynamics by a Vector Autoregressive process of order one. The resulting dynamics lends itself to a feasible estimation of the model volatility-correlation structure and market risk-premia. Then, resorting to the Principal Component Analysis we further simplify the dynamics reducing the number of covariance components. Applying the constant volatility version of our model on a sample of curves from the Euro area, we demonstrate its forecasting ability through an out-of-sample test.","[Sabelli, Chiara; Bormetti, Giacomo] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Pioppi, Michele; Sitzia, Luca] UniCredit SpA, Milan, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo] QUANTLab, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; UniCredit Group,"Sabelli, C (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",chiara.sabelli@sns.it,,"Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505",UniCredit S.p.A.; Scuola Normale Superiore; [1300240/2013],UniCredit S.p.A.; Scuola Normale Superiore;,The activity of CS is supported by the Research Agreement number [grant number 1300240/2013]; Stabilita e corenza con le aspettative di mercato degli scenari a lungo termine impiegati nella gestione dei rischi finanziari between UniCredit S.p.A. and Scuola Normale Superiore.,,58,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

It has been observed that typical CAT bond premiums have changed since the recent financial crisis, which has been attributed to market participants being increasingly risk averse. In this work, we first propose a new premium principle, the financial loss premium principle, which includes a term measuring losses in the financial market that we represent here by the Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE) of the negative daily log-return of the S&P 500 index. Our analysis of empirical evidence suggests indeed that in the post-crisis market, instead of simply increasing the fixed level of risk load universally, the increased risk aversion should be modeled jointly by a fixed level of risk load and a financial loss factor to reflect trends in the financial market. This new premium principle is shown to be flexible with respect to the confidence/exceedance level of CTE. In the second part, we focus on the particular example of extreme wildfire risk. The distribution of the amount of precipitation in Fort McMurray, Canada, which is a very important factor in the occurrence of wildfires, is analyzed using extreme value modeling techniques. A wildfire bond with parametric trigger of precipitation is then designed to mitigate extreme wildfire risk, and its premium is predicted using an extreme value analysis of its expected loss. With an application to the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, we demonstrate that the extreme value model is sensible, and we further analyze how our results and construction can be used to provide a design framework for CAT bonds which may appeal to (re) insurers and investors alike.","[Stupfler, Gilles] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Yang, Fan] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Nottingham; University of Waterloo,"Yang, F (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",gilles.stupfler@nottingham.ac.uk; fan.yang@uwaterloo.ca,"Stupfler, Gilles/AAA-2283-2021","Stupfler, Gilles/0000-0003-2497-9412",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [04242],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees for their constructive and helpful remarks which resulted in significant improvements to this paper.

Based on a large data-set of ultra-high-frequency transaction prices time-stamped to the millisecond of the S&P500 index and its two most liquid tracking ETFs, we find that their lead-lag relationship is affected by the rate of information arrival whose proxy is the unexpected trading volume of these instruments. Specifically, when information arrives, the leadership of the leading instrument may strengthen or weaken depending on whether the leading or lagging instrument responds to that information. An increase in the unexpected volume of the leader strengthens its leadership whereas an increase in the unexpected volume of the lagger weakens this leadership. In addition to the strength of leadership, an increase in the unexpected volume in response to information arrival may also have opposite effects on the lead-lag correlation coefficient depending on whether that volume increase belongs to the leader or the lagger. Finally, we find that sophisticated investors have a more significant effect on the lead-lag relationship than non-sophisticated ones.","[Thong Minh Dao; McGroarty, Frank; Urquhart, Andrew] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton; Solent University,"Dao, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",tmd2g13@soton.ac.uk,,"McGroarty, Frank/0000-0003-2962-0927; Dao, Thong/0000-0002-1926-495X; URQUHART, ANDREW/0000-0001-8834-4243",,,,,48,7,7,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We examined the cost effectiveness of NMS compared with normal practice by combining adherence improvement and intervention costs with the effect of increased adherence on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. We developed Markov models for diseases targeted by the NMS (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and antiplatelet regimens) to assess the impact of patients' non-adherence. Clinical event probability, treatment pathway, resource use and costs were extracted from literature and costing tariffs. Incremental costs and outcomes associated with each disease were incorporated additively into a composite probabilistic model and combined with adherence rates and intervention costs from the trial. Costs per extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated from the perspective of NHS England, using a lifetime horizon. NMS generated a mean of 0.05 (95% CI 0.00-0.13) more QALYs per patient, at a mean reduced cost of -A 144 pound (95% CI -769 to 73). The NMS dominates normal practice with a probability of 0.78 [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) -A 3166 pound per QALY]. NMS has a 96.7% probability of cost effectiveness compared with normal practice at a willingness to pay of A 20,000 pound per QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that targeting each disease with NMS has a probability over 0.90 of cost effectiveness compared with normal practice at a willingness to pay of A 20,000 pound per QALY. Our study suggests that the NMS increased patient medicine adherence compared with normal practice, which translated into increased health gain at reduced overall cost.","[Elliott, Rachel A.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Div Populat Hlth Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Sch Hlth Sci,Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Room 4-318,4th Floor,Jean Mcfarlane Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Tanajewski, Lukasz; Gkountouras, Georgios; Boyd, Matthew J.] Univ Nottingham, Div Pharm Practice & Policy, Sch Pharm, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Avery, Anthony J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Div Primary Care, Queens Med Ctr, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Barber, Nick] UCL, Pharm, Sch Pharm, 29-39 Brunswick Sq, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Mehta, Rajnikant] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Queens Med Ctr, RDS EM, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Latif, Asam] Univ Nottingham, Sch Hlth Sci, Queens Med Ctr, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Chuter, Antony] Patient & Publ Representat, 68 Brighton Cottages,Copyhold Lane, Lindfield RH16 1XT, Haywards Heath, England; [Waring, Justin] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Innovat Leadership & Learning, Org Sociol & Improvement Sci, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG8 2BB, England",University of Manchester; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; University of London; University College London; University of London School of Pharmacy; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Elliott, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Div Populat Hlth Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Sch Hlth Sci,Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Room 4-318,4th Floor,Jean Mcfarlane Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Rachel.a.elliott@manchester.ac.uk,"Elliott, Rachel/P-5894-2018; Boyd, Matthew/ABE-4187-2021; Chuter, Antony/GNO-9976-2022; Waring, Justin/C-5436-2015","Elliott, Rachel/0000-0002-3650-0168; Boyd, Matthew/0000-0003-2997-5090; Chuter, Antony/0000-0002-0646-5939; Tanajewski, Lukasz/0000-0002-4387-3093; Waring, Justin/0000-0003-1459-5896; Avery, Anthony/0000-0001-7591-4438; Mehta, Rajnikant/0000-0002-5341-5598; Gkountouras, Georgios/0000-0003-2093-5359",Department of Health Policy Research Programme,Department of Health Policy Research Programme,Department of Health Policy Research Programme.,,88,23,24,1,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,12,,,,,1237,1255,,10.1007/s40273-017-0554-9,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FM8GP,28776320.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415324600004,0

The ISE belongs to a class of estimators whose basic asymptotic properties were studied in Jun, Pinkse, and Wan (2015, Journal of Econometrics 187(1), 201-216). Here, we establish that the MMSE, or more precisely 3 root n vertical bar(theta) over cap (M) - theta(0)vertical bar, (locally first order) stochastically dominates the ISE under the conditions necessary for the MMSE to attain its 3 root n convergence rate and that the ISE has the same convergence rate as Horowitz's smoothed maximum score estimator (SMSE) under somewhat weaker conditions. An implication of the stochastic dominance result is that the confidence intervals of the MMSE are for any given coverage rate wider than those of the ISE, provided that the input parameter alpha(n) is not chosen too large. Further, we introduce an inference procedure that is not only rate adaptive as established in Jun et al. (2015), but also uniform in the choice of alpha(n). We propose three different first order bias elimination procedures and we discuss the choice of input parameters. We develop a computational algorithm for the ISE based on the Gibbs sampler and we examine implementational issues in detail. We argue in favor of normalizing the norm of the parameter vector as opposed to fixing one of the coefficients. Finally, we evaluate the computational efficiency of the ISE and the performance of the ISE and the proposed inference procedure in an extensive Monte Carlo study.","[Jun, Sung Jae; Pinkse, Joris] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wan, Yuanyuan] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Toronto,"Jun, SJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, 303 Kern Grad Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sjun@psu.edu,,,NSF [SES-0922127]; Human Capital Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Human Capital Foundation,"This paper is based on research supported by NSF grant SES-0922127.

The process of developing health economic models is usually complex, financially expensive and time-consuming. For these reasons, model development is sometimes based on previous model-based analyses; this endeavour is usually referred to as model replication. Such model replication activity may involve the comprehensive reproduction of an existing model or 'borrowing' all or part of a previously developed model structure. Generally speaking, the replication of an existing model may require substantially less effort than developing a new de novo model by bypassing, or undertaking in only a perfunctory manner, certain aspects of model development such as the development of a complete conceptual model and/or comprehensive literature searching for model parameters. A further motivation for model replication may be to draw on the credibility or prestige of previous analyses that have been published and/or used to inform decision making. The acceptability and appropriateness of replicating models depends on the decision-making context: there exists a trade-off between the 'savings' afforded by model replication and the potential 'costs' associated with reduced model credibility due to the omission of certain stages of model development. This paper provides an overview of the different levels of, and motivations for, replicating health economic models, and discusses the advantages, disadvantages and caveats associated with this type of modelling activity. Irrespective of whether replicated models should be considered appropriate or not, complete replicability is generally accepted as a desirable property of health economic models, as reflected in critical appraisal checklists and good practice guidelines. To this end, the feasibility of comprehensive model replication is explored empirically across a small number of recent case studies. Recommendations are put forward for improving reporting standards to enhance comprehensive model replicability.","[Bermejo, Inigo; Tappenden, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Youn, Ji-Hee] Univ Manchester, Div Populat Hlth Hlth Serv Res & Primary Care, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Sheffield; University of Manchester,"Bermejo, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",i.bermejo@sheffield.ac.uk,"Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088;",,,,,47,9,9,1,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2017,35.0,11,,,,,1113,1121,,10.1007/s40273-017-0553-x,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FK9WZ,28748450.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413863900002,0

Specifically, we focus on (undirected) exponential random graph models. We want to recover a set of parameters from the individuals' utility functions using the observation of a single, but large, social network. We show that, under some conditions, a simple logit-based estimator is coherent, consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under a weak version of homophily. The approach is compelling as the computing time is minimal and the estimator can be easily implemented using pre-programmed estimators available in most statistical packages.

Metamodeling approaches have been proposed in the past few years to address the computational issues related to the calculation of partial dollar deltas. In this paper, we investigate whether the additional complication of modeling the dependence between the partial dollar deltas improves the accuracy of the metamodeling approaches. We use several copulas to model the dependence structures of the partial dollar deltas and conduct numerical experiments to compare different metamodels. Despite the evidence of strong dependence in the estimated models, our numerical results show that modeling the dependence structures in the metamodels does not improve the accuracy of the estimations at the portfolio level. This is because the dependence between the partial dollar deltas is well captured by the covariates used in the marginal models. This finding suggests that we should focus more on marginal models than specifying the dependence structure explicitly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the evidence for such a preference among the UK public. Methods The MEDLINE, PubMed and Econlit electronic databases were searched for studies relating to preferences for prioritising cancer treatment, as well as studies relating to preferences for the characteristics of cancer (severity of disease, end-of-life). The searches were run in November 2015 and updated in March 2017. Empirical preference studies, studies of public views, and studies in English were included. Results We identified 24 studies relating to cancer preferences. Two directly addressed health trade-offs in the UK-one showed a preference for health gain in cancer, while the other found no such preference but provided results consistent with population health maximisation. Other studies mostly showed support for cancer but did not require a direct health trade-off. Severity and end-of-life searches identified 12 and 6 papers, respectively, which were additional to existing reviews. There is consistent evidence that people give priority to severe illness, while results for end-of-life are mixed. Conclusion We did not find consistent support for a preference for health gains to cancer patients in the context of health maximisation. The evidence base is small and the results are highly sensitive to study design. There remains a contradiction between these findings and the popular view of cancer, and further work is required to determine the features of cancer which contribute to that view.","[Morrell, Liz; Barker, Richard] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, CASMI, Room 4403,Level 4,Headley Way, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Oxford NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Rees, Sian] Univ Oxford, Hlth Experiences Inst, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Morrell, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, CASMI, Room 4403,Level 4,Headley Way, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.",liz.morrell@casmi.org.uk,,"Wordsworth, Sarah/0000-0002-2361-3040; Morrell, Liz/0000-0001-6382-1795","Policy Department, Cancer Research UK","Policy Department, Cancer Research UK","This work was funded by a grant from the Policy Department, Cancer Research UK, to the Centre for the Advancement of Sustainable Medical Innovation (CASMI: LM, RB).

In such a case, the buyer more likely to have a high utility type will receive the first-best allocations indifferent of his value report, while the lower type will receive the first best only if he makes a high utility report. The paper also supplements the current literature on infinite dynamic games with continuous buyer types, which relies on the use of a distribution of types with full support and an envelope theorem. With discrete types, the number of compatibility constraints considered can be greatly reduced by sandwiching the border of the space of solutions allowed by constraints: formulate the maximization problem in a wider space with fewer constraints and prove that the solution obeys a simpler set of stronger constraints that places it in the allowed region.","[Ungureanu, Sergiu] City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Ungureanu, S (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",Sergiu.Ungureanu.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

This approach is tractable because it treats the incomplete markets problem as a perturbation around the complete market constant volatility problem for the value function, which is well understood. When volatility is fast mean-reverting, this is a singular perturbation problem for a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation, while when volatility is slowly varying, it is a regular perturbation. These analyses can be combined for multifactor multiscale stochastic volatility models. The asymptotics shares remarkable similarities with the linear option pricing problem, which follows from some new properties of the Merton risk tolerance function. We give examples in the family of mixture of power utilities and also use our asymptotic analysis to suggest a practical strategy that does not require tracking the fast-moving volatility. In this paper, we present formal derivations of asymptotic approximations, and we provide a convergence proof in the case of power utility and single-factor stochastic volatility.

We develop sufficient conditions for identification of the deep structural parameters for the case where the per-period utility function ascribed to one choice in the model is parametric but the distribution of unobserved state variables is nonparametric. The proposed identification strategy does not rely on availability of the terminal period data and can therefore be applied to infinite horizon structural dynamic models. Identifying power comes from assuming that the agent's per-period utilities admit continuous choice-specific state variables that are observed with sufficient variation and satisfy certain conditional independence assumptions on the joint time series of observables. These conditions allow us to formulate exclusion restrictions for identifying the primitive structural functions of the model.,"[Chen, Le-Yu] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, LY (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",lychen@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,54,5,5,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We introduce new laboratory methods that allow us to eliminate natural inertia in subjects' decisions in continuous time experiments, thereby satisfying critical premises of the theory and enabling a first-time direct test. Applying these new methods to a simple timing game, we find strikingly large gaps in behavior between discrete and continuous time as the theory suggests. Reintroducing natural inertia into these games causes continuous time behavior to collapse to discrete time-like levels in some settings as predicted by subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. However, contra this prediction, the strength of this effect is fundamentally shaped by the severity of inertia: behavior tends towards discrete time benchmarks as inertia grows large and perfectly continuous time benchmarks as it falls towards zero. We provide evidence that these results are due to changes in the nature of strategic uncertainty as inertia approaches the continuous limit.","[Calford, Evan] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Oprea, Ryan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Calford, E (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",evancalford@gmail.com; roprea@gmail.com,,"Calford, Evan/0000-0002-9059-4847",Faculty of Arts at the University of British Columbia; National Science Foundation [SES-1357867],Faculty of Arts at the University of British Columbia; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are especially grateful to Chad Kendall for invaluable advice and technical assistance and to James Peck and David Cooper whose insightful early comments informed the evolution of the experimental design.

It assumes that the financial market is driven by a drifted Brownian motion with coefficients modulated by an external Markov process specified by the solution to a stochastic differential equation. The goal of the insurer is to maximize the expected terminal utility. This paper derives the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the control problem using a dynamic programming method. When the insurer admits an exponential utility function, we prove that there exists a unique and smooth solution to the HJB equation. We derive the explicit optimal investment policy by solving the HJB equation. We can also find that the optimal reinsurance policy optimizes a deterministic function. We also obtain the upper bound for ruin probability in finite time for the insurer when the insurer adopts optimal policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A CUSUM type estimator is proposed, and we establish first and second order asymptotics that can be used to derive consistent confidence intervals for the time of change. Our results improve upon existing theory in two primary directions. Firstly, the conditions we impose on the model errors only pertain to the order of their long run moments, and hence our results hold for nearly all stationary time series models of interest, including nonlinear time series like the ARCH and GARCH processes. Secondly, we study how the asymptotic distribution and norming sequences of the estimator depend on the magnitude of the changes in each cross-section and the common factor loadings. The performance of our results in finite samples is demonstrated with a Monte Carlo simulation study, and we consider applications to two real data sets: the exchange rates of 23 currencies with respect to the US dollar, and the GDP per capita in 113 countries.","[Horvath, Lajos; Wang, Jia] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Huskova, Marie] Charles Univ Prague, CR-11636 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Rice, Gregory] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Charles University Prague; University of Waterloo,"Horváth, L (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Math, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",horvath@math.utah.edu,"Horvath, Lajos/R-7559-2019; Hušková, Marie/L-9819-2017","Horvath, Lajos/0000-0001-8594-4972; Hušková, Marie/0000-0002-6868-1362","NSF grant DMS [1305858]; grants GACR [15-096635, 201/12/1277]",NSF grant DMS; grants GACR,"This project was supported by NSF grant DMS 1305858 and grants GACR 15-096635, GACR 201/12/1277.",,43,13,16,1,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Objective To evaluate the relationship between improvements in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and simulated health outcomes in type 2 diabetes cost-effectiveness studies. Methods A systematic review was conducted on MEDLINE and EMBASE to collect cost-effectiveness studies using type 2 diabetes simulation models that reported modelled health outcomes of blood glucose-related interventions in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or life expectancy (LE). The data extracted included information used to characterise the study cohort, the intervention's treatment effects on risk factors and model outcomes. Linear regressions were used to test the relationship between the difference in HbA(1c) (Delta HbA(1c)) and incremental QALYs (Delta QALYs) or LE (Delta LE) of intervention and control groups. The ratio between the Delta QALYs and Delta LE was calculated and a scatterplot between the ratio and Delta HbA(1c) was used to explore the relationship between these two. Results Seventy-six studies were included in this research, contributing to 124 pair of comparators. The pooled regressions indicated that the marginal effect of a 1% HbA(1c) decrease in intervention resulted in an increase in life-time QALYs and LE of 0.371 (95% confidence interval 0.286-0.456) and 0.642 (95% CI 0.494-0.790), respectively. No evidence of heterogeneity between models was found. An inverse exponential relationship was found and fitted between the ratio (Delta QALY/Delta LE) and Delta HbA(1c). Conclusion There is a consistent relationship between Delta HbA(1c) and Delta QALYs or Delta LE in cost-effectiveness analyses using type 2 diabetes simulation models. This relationship can be used as a diagnostic tool for decision makers.","[Hua, Xinyang; Lung, Thomas Wai-Chun; Clarke, Philip] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Level 4,207 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Lung, Thomas Wai-Chun] Univ Sydney, George Inst Global Hlth, Lidcombe, NSW, Australia; [Palmer, Andrew; Si, Lei] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Res Inst, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Herman, William H.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Melbourne; University of Sydney; George Institute for Global Health; University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Clarke, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Level 4,207 Bouverie St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",philip.clarke@unimelb.edu.au,"Lung, Thomas/J-9686-2017; Si, Lei/AAM-3218-2020; Palmer, Andrew/J-7289-2014","Lung, Thomas/0000-0001-9978-6311; Si, Lei/0000-0002-3044-170X; Palmer, Andrew/0000-0002-9703-7891; Hua, Xinyang/0000-0003-2102-5461","Xinyang Hua's PhD scholarship: Melbourne International Research Scholarship from the University of Melbourne; National Health and Medical Research Council project grants [GNT1084347, GNT1107140]",Xinyang Hua's PhD scholarship: Melbourne International Research Scholarship from the University of Melbourne; National Health and Medical Research Council project grants,This work is supported by Xinyang Hua's PhD scholarship: Melbourne International Research Scholarship from the University of Melbourne and some supplementary funding from two National Health and Medical Research Council project grants (GNT1084347; GNT1107140).

Methods A systematic review of the published literature (the EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit and SocINDEX databases were searched for publications in March 2016, plus manual searching) investigated the associations between study methods and the resulting values for meta-health effects estimated for use in economic evaluations. The review considered which meta-health effects were being valued and how this differed by evaluation approach, intervention investigated, source of funds and year of publication. Detailed reasons for differences observed between values for comparable meta-health effects were explored, accounting for the method of valuation. Results The search of the literature revealed 71 studies of interest; 35% involved drug interventions, with convenience, information and process of care the three meta-health effects most often investigated. Key associations with the meta-health effects were the evaluation method, the intervention, and the source of funds. Relative values for meta-health effects ranged from 0.9% to 68% of the overall value reported in a study. For a given meta-health effect, the magnitude of the effect evaluated and how the meta-health effect was described and framed relative to overall health explained the differences in relative values. Conclusions Evidence from the literature shows variability in how meta-health effects are being measured for use in economic evaluations. Understanding the sources of that variability is important if decision makers are to have confidence in how meta-health effects are valued.","[Lourenco, Richard De Abreu; Haas, Marion; Hall, Jane; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Level 2,Block 5D,Quay St, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Lourenco, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Level 2,Block 5D,Quay St, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Richard.deabreulourenco@chere.uts.edu.au,"Haas, Marion Ruth/H-2732-2017; De Abreu Lourenco, Richard/ABC-3150-2020; Hall, Jane P/I-3469-2014","De Abreu Lourenco, Richard/0000-0002-5978-8774; Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635; Hall, Jane/0000-0002-2191-0543",,,,,89,2,2,0,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2017,35.0,3,,,,,347,362,,10.1007/s40273-016-0470-4,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EL0WL,27858368.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394342400006,0

In particular, we deal with the problem of non-synchronous trading hours and intermittent high-frequency data during overnight non-trading periods. Using high-frequency data for the Euro Stoxx 50 and the S&P 500 Index between 2003 and 2011, we combine squared overnight returns and realized daytime variances to obtain synchronous 24-h realized volatilities for both markets. Specifically, we use a piece-wise weighting procedure for daytime and overnight information to take into account structural breaks in the relation between the two. To demonstrate the new possibilities that our approach opens up, we use the new 24-h volatilities to estimate a bivariate extension of Corsi et al.'s [Econom. Rev., 2008, 27(1-3), 46-78] HAR-GARCH model.

Ruxolitinib had previously been assessed as part of the STA process and was not recommended in NICE guidance issued in June 2013 (TA289). A review of TA289 was commissioned following the availability of new longer-term survival data; a price discount patient access scheme (PAS) was also introduced. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and Centre for Health Economics (CHE) Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a summary of the manufacturer or sponsor of the technology's (referred to as the company) submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance issued in March 2016. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from two good-quality multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs): COMFORT-II compared ruxolitinib with best available therapy (BAT) and COMFORT-I compared ruxolitinib with placebo. Both RCTs demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in splenomegaly and its associated symptoms in intermediate-2 and high-risk myelofibrosis patients. Overall survival was statistically significantly improved with ruxolitinib compared with BAT at 3.5 years of follow-up in the COMFORT-II trial (hazard ratio 0.58, 95 % CI 0.36-0.93). Grade 3-4 adverse events were more frequent in the ruxolitinib group than in the BAT group; 42 % compared with 25 %. Evidence relating to patients with lower-risk disease or low platelet counts (50-100 x 10(9)/L) was less robust. The company's economic model was well-presented and had an appropriate model structure. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be around A 45,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (including the PAS discount). Extensive sensitivity and scenario analyses were presented, demonstrating that the estimated ICER was robust to a range of input values and assumptions made in the model. Alternative scenarios presented by the ERG showed only modest increases in the estimated ICER, primarily as a result of including an element of drug wastage within the model. Alternative scenarios resulted in estimated ICERs ranging from around A 45,000 pound to A 49,000 pound per QALY gained (including the PAS discount). At the first appraisal meeting, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ruxolitinib was clinically effective and was a cost effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources for patients with high-risk myelofibrosis who meet NICE's end-of-life criteria. Following the consultation, the company offered a revised PAS, resulting in a revised base-case ICER of A 31,229 pound per QALY gained. The company also presented new evidence on the cost effectiveness of ruxolitinib in intermediate-2 and high-risk subgroups and a revised version of the model. The NICE Appraisal Committee considered the new evidence and recommended ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with intermediate-2-risk disease as well as patients with high-risk disease, based on International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) prognostic factors.","[Wade, Ros; Hodgson, Robert; Biswas, Mousumi; Harden, Melissa; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Wade, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ros.wade@york.ac.uk,"Wade, Rosalind Fay/AAB-5808-2019; Wade, Ros/AAB-7268-2019; Biswas, Dr. Mousumi/IUM-9021-2023","Wade, Rosalind Fay/0000-0002-8666-8110; Biswas, Mousumi/0000-0001-6781-7400; Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [14/206/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 14/206/01) and will be published as part of a compendium of Evidence Review Group (ERG) articles in Health Technology Assessment.

In particular, these data are sufficient to nonparametrically estimate the output of any individual worker with any given firm. Our identification proof is constructive and we provide computational algorithms that implement our identification strategy given the limitations of the available data sets.

In the DC plan, contributions are supposed to be a predetermined amount of money as premiums and the pension funds are allowed to be invested in a financial market which consists of a risk-free asset, a defaultable bond and a risky asset satisfied a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. Notice that a part of pension members could die during the accumulation phase, and their premiums should be withdrawn. Thus, we consider the return of premiums clauses by an actuarial method and assume that the surviving members will share the difference between the return and the accumulation equally. Taking account of the pension fund size and the volatility of the accumulation, a mean-variance criterion as the investment objective for the DC plan can be formulated, and the original optimization problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems: a post-default case and a pre-default case. By applying a game theoretic framework, the equilibrium investment strategies and the corresponding equilibrium value functions can be obtained explicitly. Economic interpretations are given in the numerical simulation, which is presented to illustrate our results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We treat the case of a semi-infinite past by developing the forecast filters and the forecast error filters explicitly. We also provide formulas for forecasting from a finite data sample. This latter application can be accomplished by using large matrices, which remains practicable when the total sample size is moderate. Expressions for the mean square error of forecasts are also derived and can be implemented readily. The flexibility and generality of these formulas are illustrated by four diverse applications: forecasting euro area macroeconomic aggregates; backcasting fertility rates by racial category; forecasting long memory inflation data; and forecasting regional housing starts using a seasonally co-integrated model.","[McElroy, Tucker] US Bur Census, Ctr Stat Res & Methodol, Washington, DC 20233 USA; [McCracken, Michael W.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Div, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"McElroy, T (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Time Series Grp, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",tucker.s.mcelroy@census.gov,"McCracken, Michael/I-5748-2016","McCracken, Michael/0000-0002-7004-1233",,,,,28,3,3,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We establish the convergence rates of our estimator for the cases of mildly/severely ill-posed models and ordinary/super smooth measurement errors. We characterize how the presence of measurement error slows down the convergence rates of the estimator.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company's submission for SAR was based predominantly on five randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of SAR against adalimumab, tocilizumab or placebo. The clinical effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of SAR against all the comparators within the scope. Therefore, the company performed three network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two different populations: two in patients who had had an inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) (one for combination therapies and one for monotherapies) and the other one in patients who had had an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis). The company's NMAs concluded that SAR in combination with cDMARDs or as monotherapy has a statistically superior efficacy to cDMARDs and a comparable efficacy to most biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in both populations. The company submitted a Markov model that assessed the cost-effectiveness of SAR from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services in seven different populations: (1) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs (cDMARD-IR); (2) cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA for whom methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated; (3) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to a TNFi (TNFi-IR); (4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom rituximab (RTX) is not an option; (5) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; (6) TNFi-IR patients after RTX; and (7) cDMARD-IR patients with moderate RA whose 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is between 4.0 and 5.1. The company's economic evaluation resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) lower than 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy versus its comparators when the comparators were less effective, and it resulted in cost savings higher than 60,000 pound per QALY lost when SAR was less effective, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible (where the ICER for SAR + MTX compared with RTX + MTX was 130,691 pound per QALY gained) and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of >4.0 (where the ICER of SAR + MTX compared with MTX was 38,254 pound per QALY gained). Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses after applying two changes to the company's model: (1) use of a latent class approach to model Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) progression for patients on cDMARDs; and (2) amendment of the company's modelling of patient progression from moderate to severe RA. The ICERs estimated by the ERG's exploratory analyses for SAR + MTX increased to 171,466 pound per QALY gained when compared with RTX + MTX in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible, and to 63,438 pound per QALY gained when compared with MTX in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of >4.0. The Appraisal Committee concluded that SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in the considered populations, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of >4.0.","[Bermejo, Inigo; Ren, Shijie; Simpson, Emma; Clowes, Mark; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Scott, David L.] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Young, Adam] Univ Hertsfordshire, Dept Rheumatol, Ctr Lifespan & Chron Illness Res, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Sheffield; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; University of Hertfordshire,"Bermejo, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",inigo.bermejo@gmail.com,"Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [19/04/17],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 19/04/17).

This significant branch of the interbank market is commonly neglected in the banking system modelling and systemic risk analysis. We construct a model where banks are allowed to use both the interbank and the securities markets to manage their liquidity demand and supply as driven by prudential requirements in a volatile environment. The network of interbank loans is dynamic and simulated every day. We show how the intrasystem cash fluctuations alone, without any external shocks, may lead to systemic defaults, and what may be a symptom of the self-organized criticality of the system. We also analyze the impact of different prudential regulations and market conditions on the interbank market resilience. We confirm that the central bank's asset purchase programmes, limiting the declines in government bond prices, can successfully stabilize banks' liquidity demands.

Indeed, these treatments have demonstrated symptomatic efficacy but no efficacy for disease modification. Objective This report reviews the cost effectiveness of IAHA and DMOADs used in the treatment of knee OA. Methods A systematic literature search of the MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and Cochrane databases was performed independently by two rheumatologists who used the same predefined eligibility criteria to identify relevant articles. Papers without abstracts and in languages other than English or French were excluded. Extracted costs were annualised and converted to 2015 euros (sic) using the Consumer Price Index of the relevant countries and the 2013 Purchasing Power Parities between these countries and the European Union average. Results A total of 95 abstracts were selected, and 13 articles were considered for the review: nine articles on IAHA and four on DMOADs. Only one article directly compared different IAHA compounds. Articles showed substantial heterogeneity in methodological approaches. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from (sic)4000 to (sic)57,550 and from (sic)240 to (sic)53,225 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for DMOADs and IAHA, respectively. Conclusions This review highlights substantial heterogeneity between studies, ranging from a cost saving (or dominating) position to very high ICERs, far above the acceptability threshold of (sic)50,000/QALY. Additional research is needed to determine reliable and robust ICER estimates for knee OA therapies.","[Salmon, Jean-Hugues; Charlot-Lambrecht, Isabelle; Eschard, Jean-Paul] Reims Univ Hosp, Maison Blanche Hosp, Rheumatol Dept, F-51092 Reims, France; [Salmon, Jean-Hugues; Jolly, Damien] Univ Reims, Fac Med, EA 3797, F-51095 Reims, France; [Rat, Anne-Christine] CHRU Nancy, Hop Brabois, Rheumatol Dept, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Rat, Anne-Christine] Univ Lorraine, APEMAC, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Rat, Anne-Christine] INSERM, CIC EC 1433, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Jolly, Damien] Reims Univ Hosp, Robert Debre Hosp, Dept Res & Innovat, F-51092 Reims, France; [Fautrel, Bruno] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ, GRC08, Paris, France; [Fautrel, Bruno] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Rheumatol Dept, 83 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",CHU de Reims; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; CHU de Nancy; Universite de Lorraine; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; CHU de Reims; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Sorbonne Universite,"Salmon, JH (通讯作者)，Reims Univ Hosp, Maison Blanche Hosp, Rheumatol Dept, F-51092 Reims, France.;Salmon, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, Fac Med, EA 3797, F-51095 Reims, France.",jhsalmon@chu-reims.fr; ac.rat@chu-nancy.fr; icharlot-lambrecht@chu-reims.fr; jpeschard@chu-reims.fr; djolly@chu-reims.fr; bruno.fautrel@psl.aphp.fr,"Rat, Anne-Christine/Q-2715-2015","Rat, Anne-Christine/0000-0003-4319-8638; Damien, JOLLY/0000-0002-1133-7907",,,,,58,7,7,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36.0,11,,,,,1321,1331,,10.1007/s40273-018-0695-5,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30047014.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446909400003,0

In earlier contributions on weak convergence to stochastic integrals, the literature commonly uses martingale and semi-martingale structures. Liang, Phillips, Wang, and Wang (2016) (see also Wang (2015), Chap. 4.5) currently extended weak convergence to stochastic integrals by allowing for a linear process or a a-mixing sequence in innovations. While these martingale, linear process and a-mixing structures have wide relevance, they are not sufficiently general to cover many econometric applications that have endogeneity and nonlinearity. This paper provides new conditions for weak convergence to stochastic integrals. Our frameworks allow for long memory processes, causal processes, and near-epoch dependence in innovations, which have applications in a wide range of econometric areas such as TAR, bilinear, and other nonlinear models.","[Peng, Jiangyan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiying] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Sydney,"Wang, QY (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,"WANG, QIYING/C-1359-2009","Wang, Qiying/0000-0002-9181-3618",China Scholarship Council (CSC); National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501025]; Applied Basic Project of Sichuan Province [2016JY0257]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572467]; Australian Research Council,China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Applied Basic Project of Sichuan Province; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank Professor Peter Phillips, Professor Saikkonen and two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments on the original version.

Dovonon and Renault (2013) recently raised a local identification issue stemming from this type of degenerate Jacobian. The local identification issue leads to a slow rate of convergence of the GMM estimator and a nonstandard asymptotic distribution of the over-identification test statistics. We show that the known form of rank-deficient Jacobian matrix contains nontrivial information about the economic model. By exploiting such information in estimation, we provide GMM estimator and over-identification tests with standard properties. The main theory developed in this paper is applied to the estimation of and inference about the common conditionally heteroskedastic (CH) features in asset returns. The performances of the newly proposed GMM estimators and over-identification tests are investigated under the similar simulation designs used in Dovonon and Renault (2013).","[Lee, Ji Hyung] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Liao, Zhipeng] UC Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, 1407 W Gregory Dr,214 David Kinley Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jihyung@illinois.edu,"Lee, JIn/HTL-6278-2023; Lee, Ji Hyung/HNI-8824-2023","Lee, Ji Hyung/0000-0002-4591-5517",,,,,25,7,7,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

In 2009, the Chinese government launched a series of measures to de-incentivise over-prescription in public health facilities, including decoupling the link between facility income and the sale of medicines. Objectives We evaluated the effects of these measures on procurement costs and the volume of antibiotics in county public hospitals. Methods The study was undertaken in the Hubei province of China, where 64 county public hospitals implemented the reform in sequence at three different stages. A quasi-natural experiment design was employed. We performed generalised linear regressions with a difference-in-differences approach using 22,713 procurement records of antibiotics from November 2014 to December 2016. Results The regression results showed that the reform contributed to a 14.79% increase in total costs for antibiotics (p = 0.013), particularly costs for injectable antibiotics (p = 0.022) and first-line antibiotics (p = 0.030). The procurement prices for antibiotics remained largely comparable to those in the control group, but the reform led to a 17.30% increase in the procurement volume (expressed as defined daily doses) of second-line antibiotics (p = 0.032). Conclusions County public hospitals procured more antibiotics and greater numbers of expensive antibiotics, such as those administered via injection, to compensate for the loss of income from the sale of medicines, leading to an increased total cost of antibiotics.","[Tang, Yuqing; Liu, Junjie; Zhang, Xinping] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chaojie] La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol & Publ Hlth, Kingsbury Dr, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Zuo, Keyuan] Hubei Publ Resource Trading Ctr, 252 Zhongbei Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; La Trobe University,"Zhang, XP (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zuo, KY (通讯作者)，Hubei Publ Resource Trading Ctr, 252 Zhongbei Rd, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xpzhang602@hust.edu.cn; 418754084@qq.com,"Liu, Chaojie/Q-6915-2018","Liu, Chaojie/0000-0003-0877-0424; Zhang, Xinping/0000-0002-0688-2417",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71704058],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant number 71704058.

We use the proposed modeling framework to analyze the effects of trading frequency on market liquidity in a very general setting. In particular, we demonstrate the dual effect of high trading frequency. On the one hand, the higher frequency increases market efficiency, if the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium. On the other hand, it also makes markets more fragile, in the sense that the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium only if they are market neutral (i.e., their beliefs satisfy certain martingale property). Even a very small deviation from market neutrality may cause the agents to stop providing liquidity, if the trading frequency is sufficiently high, which represents an endogenous liquidity crisis (also known as flash crash) in the market. This framework enables us to provide more insight into how such a liquidity crisis unfolds, connecting it to the so-called adverse selection effect.","[Gayduk, Roman; Nadtochiy, Sergey] Univ Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Nadtochiy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Math, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sergeyn@umich.edu,,,NSF [DMS-1411824],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Partial support from the NSF Grant DMS-1411824 is acknowledged by both authors.

Moving beyond existing results in the literature, we show that the agent's beliefs regarding the fundamental converge under weak conditions. Furthermore, we identify a broad class of situations in which learning about the fundamental is self-defeating: it leads the individual systematically away from the correct belief and toward lower performance. Due to his overconfidence, the agenteven if initially correctbecomes too pessimistic about the fundamental. As he adjusts his behavior in response, he lowers outcomes and hence becomes even more pessimistic about the fundamental, perpetuating the misdirected learning. The greater is the loss from choosing a suboptimal action, the further the agent's action ends up from optimal. We partially characterize environments in which self-defeating learning occurs, and show that the decisionmaker learns to take the optimal action if, and in a sense only if, a specific non-identifiability condition is satisfied. In contrast to an overconfident agent, an underconfident agent's misdirected learning is self-limiting and therefore not very harmful. We argue that the decision situations in question are common in economic settings, including delegation, organizational, effort, and public-policy choices.","[Heidhues, Paul] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Koszegi, Botond] Cent European Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Budapest, Hungary; [Strack, Philipp] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Central European University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Heidhues, P (通讯作者)，Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Dusseldorf, Germany.",heidhues@dice.uni-duesseldorf.de; botondkoszegi@gmail.com; pstrack@berkeley.edu,,,European Research Council [313341]; European Research Council (ERC) [313341] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to a co-editor, three anonymous referees, Roland Benabou, Daniel Benjamin, Volker Nocke, Demian Pouzo, and Francesco Squintani, as well as seminar and conference audiences for insightful comments and feedback.

A large multinational dataset, including 3L and 5L data for eight patient groups and a student cohort, was used to compare 3L versus 5L value sets for Canada, China, England/UK (5L/3L, respectively), Japan, The Netherlands, South Korea and Spain. We used distributional analyses and two methods exploring discriminatory power: relative efficiency as assessed by the F statistic, and an area under the curve for the receiver-operating characteristics approach. Differences in outcomes were explored by separating descriptive system effects from valuation effects, and by exploring distributional location effects. In terms of distributional evenness, efficiency of scale use and the face validity of the resulting distributions, 5L was superior, leading to an increase in sensitivity and precision in health status measurement. When compared with 5L, 3L systematically overestimated health problems and consequently underestimated utilities. This led to bias, i.e. over- or underestimations of discriminatory power. We conclude that 5L provides more precise measurement at individual and group levels, both in terms of descriptive system data and utilities. The increased sensitivity and precision of 5L is likely to be generalisable to longitudinal studies, such as in intervention designs. Hence, we recommend the use of the 5L across applications, including economic evaluation, clinical and public health studies. The evaluative framework proved to be useful in assessing preference-based instruments and might be useful for future work in the development of descriptive systems or health classifications.","[Janssen, Mathieu F.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Med Psychol & Psychotherapy, Erasmus MC, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bonsel, Gouke J.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bonsel, Gouke J.] Univ Utrecht, Div Mother & Child, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; Utrecht University; National University of Singapore,"Janssen, MF (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Med Psychol & Psychotherapy, Erasmus MC, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mf.bas.janssen@gmail.com,,,EuroQol Research Foundation [2016620],EuroQol Research Foundation,This work was funded by the EuroQol Research Foundation (Grant number EQ Project 2016620).,,58,200,203,0,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2018,36.0,6,,,,,675,697,,10.1007/s40273-018-0623-8,0.0,,,23,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GG0LA,29470821.0,"Green Published, hybrid",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000432368700005,0

First, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the familiar augmented Dickey-Fuller [ADF] statistics in the case where the shocks follow a linear process driven by infinite variance innovations. We show that these distributions are free of serial correlation nuisance parameters but depend on the tail index of the infinite variance process. These distributions are shown to coincide with the corresponding results for the case where the shocks follow a finite autoregression, provided the lag length in the ADF regression satisfies the same o(T-1/3) rate condition as is required in the finite variance case. In addition, we establish the rates of consistency and (where they exist) the asymptotic distributions of the ordinary least squares sieve estimates from the ADF regression. Given the dependence of their null distributions on the unknown tail index, our second contribution is to explore sieve wild bootstrap implementations of the ADF tests. Under the assumption of symmetry, we demonstrate the asymptotic validity (bootstrap consistency) of the wild bootstrap ADF tests. This is done by establishing that (conditional on the data) the wild bootstrap ADF statistics attain the same limiting distribution as that of the original ADF statistics taken conditional on the magnitude of the innovations.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe; Georgiev, Iliyan] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Taylor, A.

In the present paper, we provide a characterization result for the core for games with externalities by extending one form of consistency studied by Moulin (J Econ Theory 36:120-148, 1985), which is often referred to as the complement-reduced game property. Moreover, we analyze another consistency formulated by Davis and Maschler (Naval Res Logist Quart 12:223-259, 1965), called the max-reduced game property and a final consistency called the projection-reduced game property. In environments with externalities, we discuss some asymmetric results among these different forms of reduced games.","[Abe, Takaaki] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Abe, T (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",takatomo3639@asagi.waseda.jp,"Abe, Takaaki/AAE-3949-2022","Abe, Takaaki/0000-0003-1785-2288",Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16J00035] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author is grateful to two anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions and comments.

The allocation problem, on the other hand, is generally much more involved even when a specific risk measure inducing the allocation rule is assumed, let alone the case when a class of risk measures is considered. In this paper we put forward arguments showing that the problems of determining and allocating the aggregate risk capital can often be viewed as being of similar complexity. In particular, we show that this is the case for the entire class of weighted risk capital allocations, as well as for risk portfolios that are exposed to systematic and specific risk factors. We provide detailed analyses of the Weighted Insurance Pricing Model (WIPM) under multiplicative and additive systematic-risk frameworks. Also, a Gini-type WIPM, which is related to the WIPM in a similar way as the dual (i.e., rank dependent) utility theory is related to the classical utility theory, is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company's submission (CS), the ERG report and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the appraisal committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS. In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 44,032 pound per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of A 52,695 pound and A 49,392 pound per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively. Since the AC concluded that the most plausible ICER was A 49,392 pound per QALY gained, and that T/T meets end-of-life criteria, T/T was recommended as a cost effective use of NHS resources.","[Ramaekers, Bram L.

Methods We analyzed the data from the SELECT BC study, a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase III study conducted in Japan, which compared first-line S-1 with taxane therapies. Heath utility and HRQOL were assessed using the EQ-5D-3L and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Health utility was calculated based on societal preferences, and AEs were reported at each cycle of the study treatment. Linear marginal mean models were used to quantify the impact of the last AEs (with 10 or more incidences) observed before HRQOL assessment on health utility and HRQOL. Results Analysis included 380 patients and 12 (of 15) AEs. Grade 1 nausea and oral mucositis, grade 1 and 2 edema, and grade 2 fatigue, motor and sensory neuropathy, and myalgia were significantly associated with disutility, measured using the EQ-5D-3L. Grade 1 oral mucositis, grade 1 and 2 fatigue, and grade 2 sensory neuropathy were significantly associated with impaired global health status in the EORTC QLQ-C30. AEs associated with decrements in the five functioning scales included fatigue, oral mucositis, nausea, edema, motor and sensory neuropathy, and myalgia. Conclusions We reported disutilities caused by AEs in patients with metastatic breast cancer under chemotherapy. These findings can be applied to future model-based cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Hagiwara, Yasuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat, Grad Sch Med, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Shiroiwa, Takeru; Fukuda, Takashi] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth & Welf Serv, Wako, Saitama, Japan; [Shimozuma, Kojiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Coll Life Sci, Kusatsu, Japan; [Kawahara, Takuya; Uemura, Yukari] Univ Tokyo Hosp, Div Biostat, Clin Res Support Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Takanori] Natl Hosp Org Sendai Med Ctr, Dept Breast Surg, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Taira, Naruto] Okayama Univ Hosp, Dept Breast & Endocrine Surg, Okayama, Japan; [Ohashi, Yasuo] Chuo Univ, Dept Integrated Sci & Engn Sustainable Soc, Fac Sci & Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Mukai, Hirofumi] Natl Canc Ctr Hosp East, Dept Breast & Med Oncol, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Institute of Public Health - Japan; Ritsumeikan University; University of Tokyo; Okayama University; Chuo University; National Cancer Center - Japan,"Hagiwara, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Dept Biostat, Grad Sch Med, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",hagiwara@epistat.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kawahara, Takuya/AAC-8629-2019; Takeru, Shiroiwa/O-7926-2019","Kawahara, Takuya/0000-0002-3859-2756; Shiroiwa, Takeru/0000-0003-3055-9932","Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR) of the Public Health Research Foundation; Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K08894, 15K15168] Funding Source: KAKEN","Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR) of the Public Health Research Foundation; Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The SELECT BC study was sponsored by the Comprehensive Support Project for Oncology Research (CSPOR) of the Public Health Research Foundation.

As there is little guidance available on best practices for those who wish to conduct them, we provide guidance in the form of 'Key steps for busy analysts,' who may have very little time and require highly favorable results. Our guidance highlights the continued need for rigorous conduct and transparent reporting of economic evaluations regardless of the modeling approach taken, and the importance of modeling that better reflects reality, which includes better approaches to considering plausibility, estimating relative treatment effects, dealing with post-progression effects, and appropriate characterization of the uncertainty from modeling itself.","[Beca, Jaclyn] Canc Care Ontario, Pharmacoecon Res Unit, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, 1200,10405 Jasper Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 3N4, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Chan, Kelvin K.

More precisely, Markov regime-switching C-vine and D-vine decompositions of the Student's t copula are proposed and applied to returns on diversified portfolios of stocks, represented by the G7 stock market indices. The empirical results show evidence of regime shifts in the dependence structure with high contagion risk during crisis periods.

We find that takeover bids with higher M&A Indices are more likely to succeed. Moreover, the M&A Index shows a strong and positive relation with the acquirers' post-acquisition stock performance in the short run and operating performance in the long run. After constructing three portfolios under a buy-and-hold strategy, we find that efficient portfolios with the highest indices earn higher equity returns and monthly alphas than inefficient portfolios with the lowest indices.

Specifically, an asset-liability manager is allowed to invest not only in a risk-free bond and a stock, but also in a derivative, whose price depends on the underlying price of the stock and its volatility. By solving a system of two backward stochastic differential equations, we derive the explicit expressions of the efficient strategies and the corresponding efficient frontiers in two cases, with and without the derivative asset. Moreover, we consider the special case of an optimal investment problem with no liability commitment, which is also not studied in the literature. We also provide some numerical examples to illustrate our results and find that the efficient frontier of the case with the derivative is always better than that of the case without the derivative. Moreover, under the same variance, the expectation of the case with the derivative can reach up to as twice as that of the case without the derivative in some situations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the KSS test relies on the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, which is not robust to a heavy-tailed distribution and, in practice, the test suffers from a large power loss. This study develops three kinds of quantile nonlinear unit root tests: the quantile t-ratio test; the quantile Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; and the quantile Cramer-von Mises test. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that these tests have significantly better power when an innovation follows a non-normal distribution. In addition, the quantile t-ratio test can reveal the heterogeneity of the asymmetric dynamics in a time series. In our empirical studies, we investigate the unit root properties of U.S. macroeconomic time series and the real effective exchange rates for 61 countries. The results show that our proposed tests reject the unit roots more often, indicating that the series are likely to be asymmetric nonlinear reverting processes.","[Li, Haiqi] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Park, Sung Y.] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Hunan University; Chung Ang University,"Park, SY (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",sungpark@cau.ac.kr,,"Park, Sung Yong/0000-0001-9149-7603",,,,,44,39,41,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Instead of the commonly used factor-based decomposition framework, we consider modeling mortality improvements using a random field specification with a given causal structure. Such a class of models introduces dependencies among adjacent cohorts aiming at capturing, among others, the cohort effects and cross generations correlations. It also describes the conditional heteroskedasticity of mortality. The proposed model is a generalization of the now widely used AR-ARCH models for random processes. For such a class of models, we propose an estimation procedure for the parameters. Formally, we use the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) and show its statistical consistency and the asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters. The framework being general, we investigate and illustrate a simple variant, called the three-level memory model, in order to fully understand and assess the effectiveness of the approach for modeling mortality dynamics.

The absence of nesting and marginal conditions, contrarily to the nested Archimedean copulas approach, leads to major advantages, such as a flexible range of possible combinations in the choice of distributions, the existence of explicit formulas for the distribution of the sum, and computational ease in high dimensions. A balance between flexibility and parsimony is targeted. After presenting the construction technique, properties of the proposed copulas are investigated and illustrative examples are given.

We study the existence of equilibria that are resilient to coalitional deviations of unbounded and bounded size (i.e., strong equilibria and k-equilibria respectively). We show that pure Nash equilibria and 2-equilibria exist, and give an example in which no 3-equilibrium exists. Moreover, we prove that strong equilibria exist for various special cases. We also study the price of anarchy (PoA) and price of stability (PoS) for these solution concepts. We show that the PoS for strong equilibria is 1 in almost all of the special cases for which we have proven strong equilibria to exist. The PoA for pure Nash equilbria turns out to be unbounded, even when we fix the graph on which the coordination game is to be played. For the PoA for k-equilibria, we show that the price of anarchy is between and . The latter upper bound is tight for (i.e., strong equilibria). Finally, we consider the problems of computing strong equilibria and of determining whether a joint strategy is a k-equilibrium or strong equilibrium.

The main result there shows that the value process of this control problem can uniquely be characterized in terms of a first-order backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE) and a pathwise differential inclusion. In this paper, we additionally assume that the cash flow process of the swing option is left-continuous in expectation. Under this assumption, we show that the value process is continuously differentiable in the space variable that represents the volume in which the holder of the option can still exercise until maturity.

Using the equilibrium conditions, we perform an empirical analysis using data on the Second Congo War, a conflict that involves many groups in a complex network of informal alliances and rivalries. The estimates of the fighting externalities are then used to infer the extent to which the conflict intensity can be reduced through (i) dismantling specific fighting groups involved in the conflict; (ii) weapon embargoes; (iii) interventions aimed at pacifying animosity among groups. Finally, with the aid of a random utility model, we study how policy shocks can induce a reshaping of the network structure.","[Konig, Michael D.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rohner, Dominic; Thoenig, Mathias] Univ Lausanne, Dept Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zilibotti, Fabrizio] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Zurich; University of Lausanne; Yale University,"König, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Koenig, Michael/IVH-5609-2023","Rohner, Dominic/0000-0003-2660-4550","ERC [GRIEVANCES-313327]; Swiss National Fund Grant [100017_150159]; Swiss National Science Foundation [100018_140266, PZ00P1_154957/1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_140266, 100017_150159, PZ00P1_154957] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Swiss National Fund Grant; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank Valentin Muller, Sebastian Ottinger, Andre Python, Timo Schaefer, Matthias Schief, Nathan Zorzi, and Laura Zwyssig for excellent research assistance.

These include financial time series, which can be particularly heavy tailed. In this paper, we propose a novel log-transform-based least-squares approach to the estimation of GARCH(1,1) models. Within this approach, the scale of the estimated volatility is dependent on an unknown tuning constant. By means of a backtesting exercise on both real and simulated data, we show that knowledge of the tuning constant is not crucial for Value at Risk prediction. However, this does not apply to many other applications where correct identification of the volatility scale is required. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative two-stage least-squares estimators and we derive their asymptotic properties under very mild moment conditions for the errors. In particular, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality at the standard convergence rate for our estimators. Their finite sample properties are assessed by means of an extensive simulation study.","[Preminger, Arie] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Storti, Giuseppe] Univ Salerno, Via G Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Salerno,"Storti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Via G Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",storti@unisa.it,"Storti, Giuseppe/O-9636-2015","Storti, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4380-4925","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) through PRIN [2010J3LZEN]","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) through PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The authors thank Christian M.

This study evaluated the cost effectiveness and impact of dengue vaccination in Malaysia from both provider and societal perspectives using a dynamic transmission mathematical model. The model incorporated sensitivity analyses, Malaysia-specific data, evidence from recent phase III studies and pooled efficacy and long-term safety data to refine the estimates from previous published studies. Unit costs were valued in $US, year 2013 values. Six vaccination programmes employing a three-dose schedule were identified as the most likely programmes to be implemented. In all programmes, vaccination produced positive benefits expressed as reductions in dengue cases, dengue-related deaths, life-years lost, disability-adjusted life-years and dengue treatment costs. Instead of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), we evaluated the cost effectiveness of the programmes by calculating the threshold prices for a highly cost-effective strategy [ICER < 1 x gross domestic product (GDP) per capita] and a cost-effective strategy (ICER between 1 and 3 x GDP per capita). We found that vaccination may be cost effective up to a price of $US32.39 for programme 6 (highly cost effective up to $US14.15) and up to a price of $US100.59 for programme 1 (highly cost effective up to $US47.96) from the provider perspective. The cost-effectiveness analysis is sensitive to under-reporting, vaccine protection duration and model time horizon. Routine vaccination for a population aged 13 years with a catch-up cohort aged 14-30 years in targeted hotspot areas appears to be the best-value strategy among those investigated. Dengue vaccination is a potentially good investment if the purchaser can negotiate a price at or below the cost-effective threshold price.","[Shafie, Asrul Akmal; Yeo, Hui Yee] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Discipline Social & Adm Pharm, George Town 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Coudeville, Laurent] Sanofi Pasteur SA, 2 Ave Pont Pasteur, F-69367 Lyon 07, France; [Steinberg, Lucas] Sanofi Pasteur Malaysia, Unit TB-18-1,Level 18,Tower B,Plaza 33, Petaling Jaya 46200, Selangor, Malaysia; [Gill, Balvinder Singh; Jahis, Rohani] Fed Govt Adm Ctr, Minist Hlth Malaysia, Dis Control Div, Block E1,E3,E6,E7 & E10,Parcel E, Putrajaya 62590, Malaysia; [Amar-Singh, H.

The more the DM spends on effort, the more likely the target is reached. Besides the risk of missing the target despite his effort, the DM faces additional uncertainty in that both the target and the status quo are subject to exogenous shocks that are beyond the DM's control. We consider two cases: the additive case in which the DM's effort affects solely the likelihood of achieving the target, and the multiplicative case in which the DM's effort also has direct effect on the target and the status quo. Using the theory of monotone comparative statics and risk apportionment, we derive sufficient conditions under which the DM spends more on effort when the target experiences an improvement in risk via higher-order stochastic dominance.

We consider the recent approach of Demetrescu et al. (2009) who recommend testing a composite null. We assess this methodology in the presence of trends (linear or broken) whose magnitude is small enough not to be always detectable at conventional significance levels. We model them using local asymptotics and derive the properties of the test statistics. We show that whether the trend is orthogonal to the cointegrating vector has a major impact on the distributions but that the test combination approach remains valid. We apply of the methodology to the study of cointegration properties between global temperatures and the radiative forcing of human gas emissions.

The surplus process is described by a classical Cramer-Lundberg (C-L) model and the financial market contains a pair of mispriced stocks, a risk-free asset, and a market index. The insurer is ambiguity-averse and has specific modeling risk aversion preferences for the financial market's diffusion term and insurance model's jump term respectively. The statistical arbitrage opportunities which are afforded by our mispricing model feature are particularly timely in the insurance investment context for markets in Hong Kong and mainland China. Similar to Maenhout and Robust (2004), we incorporate the ambiguity aversion and formulate an optimal robust reinsurance -investment problem. By employing the dynamic programming approach, we derive the explicit optimal robust reinsurance-investment strategy and optimal value function. We provide numerical illustrations to analyze the behavior of our formulae and make practical recommendations. By studying our portfolio allocation sensitivity to various parameters, among other things, we uncover and analyze complex behaviors resulting from asymmetry between the mean-reversion rates of the mispriced stocks. We also define and analyze various utility losses which explain the importance of ambiguity aversion, surplus-jump, mispricing, and reinsurance in our model. Some of our findings include: the importance of taking advantage of Mispricing for medium and long-term investment strategies, whereas decisions with a one-year horizon or less can usually ignore mispricing arbitrage opportunities; a recommendation not to ignore jumps in the surplus model; and an analysis of how crucial it is to incorporate ambiguity aversion, especially for moderate time horizons.

We examine how the GFC has changed the way equity markets group together based on the similarity of stock indices' daily returns. Our examination is based on agglomerative clustering methods, which yield a hierarchical structure that represents how stock markets relate to each other based on their cross-section similarity. Main results show that both hierarchical structures, before and after the GFC, are readily interpretable, and indicate that geographical factors dominate the hierarchy. The main features of equity markets' hierarchical structure agree with most stylized facts reported in related literature. The most noticeable change after the GFC is an increase in (geographical) clustering. However, the increase in clusters' compactness and the decrease in clusters' separateness point out that world equity markets became more interconnected after the GFC. Some changes in the hierarchy that do not conform to geographical clustering are explained by well-known idiosyncratic features or shocks.","[Leon, Carlos; Martinez, Constanza] Banco Republ, Financial Infrastruct Oversight Dept, Bogota, Colombia; [Leon, Carlos] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Kim, Geun-Young; Lee, Daeyup] Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Banco de la Republica Colombia; Tilburg University; Bank of Korea,"León, C (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Financial Infrastruct Oversight Dept, Bogota, Colombia.;León, C (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands.",cleonrin@banrep.gov.co,"Martinez-Ventura, Constanza/G-3103-2017","Martinez-Ventura, Constanza/0000-0001-6128-5095",,,,,48,7,7,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

How important this effect is, depends on the exact topology of the network on which the supervisory authorities have typically very incomplete knowledge. In order to explore the extent of contagion effects and to analyse the effectiveness of macroprudential measures to contain such effects, a reconstruction of the quantitative features of the empirical network would be needed. We propose a probabilistic approach to such a reconstruction: we propose to combine some important known quantities (like the size of the banks) with a realistic stochastic representation of the remaining structural elements. Our approach allows us to evaluate relevant measures for the contagion risk after default of one unit (i.e. the number of expected subsequent defaults, or their probabilities). For some quantities we are able to derive closed form solutions, others can be obtained via computational mean-field approximations.","[Montagna, Mattia] European Cent Bank, Macroprudential Policy & Financial Stabil, Frankfurt, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Jaume 1, Computat Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",European Central Bank; University of Kiel; Universitat Jaume I,"Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Lux, T (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Computat Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",lux@bwl.uni-kiel.de,,,European Union Seventh Framework Programme [612955],European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by European Union Seventh Framework Programme [grant agreement number 612955].,,43,22,22,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The preferred-habitat theory predicts a positive relation between the term spread and relative supply of longer term debt, and that this relation is stronger when risk aversion is high. To capture this effect, a time-varying coefficient model is introduced and applied to German bond data. The results support the theoretical predictions and indicate substantial time variation: under high risk aversion, yield spreads react about three times more strongly than when risk aversion is low. The accumulated response of term spreads to a one standard deviation change in debt supply ranges between 4 and 46 basis points.","[Strohsal, Till] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Strohsal, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Berlin, Germany.",till.strohsal@fu-berlin.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [CRC 649],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am grateful for comments and suggestions received from two anonymous referees, Uwe Hassler, Helmut Lutkepohl, Dieter Nautz, Sven Schreiber, Lars Winkelmann, Enzo Weber, Jurgen Wolters as well as participants of the IWH Workshop on Central Bank Communication and Decision Making, Halle, Germany, the 6th IFABS Conference on Alternative Futures for Global Banking: Competition, Regulation and Reform, Lisbon, Portugal and the 14th INFINITI Conference on International Finance, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.

The approach involves first transforming the time series using orthonormal basis functions in L-2[0, 1], which have energy concentrated at low frequencies, and then running an augmented regression based on the transformed data and constructing the test statistics in the usual way. The approach is essentially the same as the trend instrumental variable approach of Phillips (2014), but the number of orthonormal basis functions is held fixed for the development of the standard F and t asymptotic theory. The tests are extremely simple to implement, as they can be carried out in exactly the same way as if the transformed regression is a classical linear normal regression. In particular, critical values are from the standard F or t distribution. The proposed F and t tests are robust in that they are asymptotically valid regardless of whether the number of basis functions is held fixed or allowed to grow with the sample size. The F and t tests have more accurate size in finite samples than existing tests such as the asymptotic chi-squared and normal tests based on the fully modified OLS estimator of Phillips and Hansen (1990) and can be made as powerful as the latter test.","[Hwang, Jungbin] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA; [Sun, Yixiao] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Connecticut; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sun, YX (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",yisun@ucsd.edu,,,NSF [SES-1530592],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Michael Jansson and two anonymous referees for constructive comments.

Although a non-homogeneous semi-Markov multi-state model is probably the best candidate for this purpose, most of the current researches assume, maybe abusively, that the Markov assumption is satisfied when fitting the model. In this context, using the Aalen-Johansen estimators for transition probabilities can induce bias, which can be important when the Markov assumption is strongly unstated. Based on some recent studies developing non-Markov estimators in the illness-death model that we can easily extend to a more general acyclic multi-state model, we exhibit three non-parametric estimators of transition probabilities of paying cash-flows, which are of interest when pricing or reserving LTC guarantees in discrete time. As our method directly estimates these quantities instead of transition intensities, it is possible to derive asymptotic results for these probabilities under non-dependent random right-censorship, obtained by re-setting the system with two competing risk blocks. Inclusion of left-truncation is also considered. We conduct simulations to compare the performance of our transition probabilities estimators without the Markov assumption. Finally, we propose a numerical application with LTC insurance data, which is traditionally analyzed with a semi-Markov model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It has been shown how these size distortions can be resolved using the wild bootstrap. In this paper, we first derive the asymptotic power envelope for the unit root testing problem when the non-stationary volatility process is known. Next, we show that under suitable conditions, adaptation with respect to the volatility process is possible, in the sense that non-parametric estimation of the volatility process leads to the same asymptotic power envelope. Implementation of the resulting test involves cross-validation and the wild bootstrap. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that the asymptotic results are reflected in finite sample properties, and an empirical analysis of real exchange rates illustrates the applicability of the proposed procedures.","[Boswijk, H.

We work under a complex realistic environment: The surplus process is described by a jump-diffusion model and the financial market contains a market index, a risk-free asset, and a pair of mispriced stocks, where the expected return rate of the stocks and the mispricing follow mean reverting stochastic processes which take into account liquidity constraints. The insurer is allowed to purchase reinsurance and to invest in the financial market. We formulate an optimal robust reinsurance-investment problem under the assumption that the insurer is ambiguity-averse to the uncertainty from the financial market and to the uncertainty of the insured's claims. Ambiguity aversion is an aversion to the uncertainty taken by making investment decisions based on a misspecified model. By employing the dynamic programming approach, we derive explicit formulae for the optimal robust reinsurance-investment strategy and the optimal value function. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of some parameters on the optimal strategy and on utility loss functions. Among our various practical findings and recommendations, we find that strengthened market liquidity significantly increases the demand for hedging from the mispriced market, to take advantage of the statistical arbitrage it affords.

Our algorithms draw from a conjugate uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the orthogonal reduced-form parameterization and transform the draws into the structural parameterization; this transformation induces a normal-generalized-normal posterior over the structural parameterization. The uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the orthogonal reduced-form parameterization has been prominent after the work of Uhlig (2005). We use Beaudry, Nam, and Wang's (2011) work on the relevance of optimism shocks to show the dangers of using alternative approaches to implementing sign and zero restrictions to identify SVARs like the penalty function approach.

This provides a pricing mechanism to calculate the fundamental value of a financial asset in the asymptotic market. We introduce the notion of asymptotic bubbles by showing that this fundamental value can be strictly lower than the current price of the asset. In the case of weakly converging markets, we show that this fundamental value is equal to an expectation of the terminal value of the asset in the weak-limit market. From a practical perspective, we relate the asymptotic superreplication price to a limit of quantile-hedging prices. This shows that even when a price process is a true martingale, it can have properties similar to a bubble, up to a set of small probability. For practical applications, we give examples of weakly converging discrete-time models (e.g. some GARCH models) and large financial models that present bubbles.","[Roch, Alexandre] 315 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal H2X 3X2, PQ, Canada",,"Roch, A (通讯作者)，315 Rue St Catherine Est, Montreal H2X 3X2, PQ, Canada.",roch.alexandre_f@uqam.ca,,,Institute of Financial Mathematics of Montreal; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Institute of Financial Mathematics of Montreal; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This research was supported by the Institute of Financial Mathematics of Montreal and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

I introduce a uniformly (in the data-generating process) consistent estimator under nearly minimal identifying assumptions. The proposed estimator, called the integrated instrumental variables (IIV) estimator, is a simple weighted least-squares estimator. It does not require the choice of a bandwidth or tuning parameter, or the selection of a finite set of instruments. Thus, the estimator is extremely simple to implement. Monte Carlo evidence supports the theoretical claims and suggests that the IIV estimator is a robust complement to optimal instrumental variables in finite samples. In an application with quarterly UK data, the IIV estimator estimates a positive and significant elasticity of intertemporal substitution and an equally sensible estimate for its reciprocal, in sharp contrast to instrumental variables methods that fail to identify these parameters.","[Escanciano, Juan Carlos] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 105 Wylie Hall,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Escanciano, JC (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, 105 Wylie Hall,100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jescanci@indiana.edu,"Escanciano, Juan Carlos/R-1878-2018","Escanciano, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6559-416X",,,,,45,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the Iranian healthcare perspective to find an optimum duration of trastuzumab use in Iran. We compared four treatment strategies comprising chemotherapy and varying durations of trastuzumab use (no trastuzumab, 6, 9 months, and 1 year), and a Markov model and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were used to estimate the costs and effects of the strategies. We then examined the cost effectiveness of the strategies at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds and ages at onset of treatment. Incremental costs (versus no trastuzumab) were a,notsign8826 (6 months), a,notsign13,808 (9 months) and a,notsign18,588 (12 months), while incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 0.65 (6 months), 0.87 (9 months) and 1.14 (12 months). At a threshold of 3 x gross domestic product (GDP)/capita (a,notsign21,000/QALY) and for patients younger than 59 years, the 6-month protocol was most likely to be cost effective (probability of 42%). At a threshold of 4 x GDP/capita (a,notsign28,000/QALY), the 6-month and 1-year regimens were essentially equal in cost effectiveness (37 and 35%, respectively). At this WTP threshold, the 6-month and 1-year regimens were optimal strategies only for patients up to 66 and 44 years of age, respectively. In contrast to clinical guidelines, 6 months of trastuzumab may be the most cost-effective option for Iran. The lower absolute WTP threshold and lower life expectancy compared with high-income countries are two crucial parameters in the cost effectiveness of interventions in MICs. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between maximum population health and maintaining affordability in these countries.","[Ansaripour, Amir; Uyl-de Groot, Carin A.; Redekop, W.

Owing to the complicated shape of the LGD distribution, using a smooth density function as a driver to estimate it may result in a decline in model fit. To overcome this problem, we first apply the logistic regression to estimate the LGD cumulative distribution function. Then, we convert the result into the LGD distribution estimate. To implement the newly proposed estimation procedure, we collect a sample of 5269 defaulted debts from Moody's Default and Recovery Database. A performance study is performed using 2000 pairs of in-sample and out-of-sample data-sets with different sizes that are randomly selected from the entire sample. Our results show that the newly proposed procedure has better and more robust performance than its alternatives, in the sense of yielding more accurate in-sample and out-of-sample LGD distribution estimates.

Crizotinib has previously been assessed by NICE for patients with previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC (TA 296). It was not approved in this previous appraisal, but had been made available through the cancer drugs fund. As part of this new appraisal, the company included a price discount patient access scheme (PAS). The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company's submission and the ERG's review and summarises the resulting NICE guidance issued in August 2016. The main clinical-effectiveness data were derived from a multicentre randomised controlled trial-PROFILE 1014-that compared crizotinib with pemetrexed chemotherapy in combination with carboplatin or cisplatin in patients with untreated non-squamous ALK-positive NSCLC. In the trial, crizotinib demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The company's economic model was a three-state 'area under the curve' Markov model. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be greater than 50,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (excluding the PAS discount). The ERG assessment of the evidence submitted by the company raised a number of concerns. In terms of the clinical evidence, the OS benefit was highly uncertain due to the cross-over permitted in the trial and the immaturity of the data; only 26% of events had occurred by the data cut-off point. In the economic modelling, the most significant concerns related to the analysis of OS and assumptions made regarding the duration of therapy. The ERG exploratory re-analysis of the OS data relaxed the assumption of proportional hazards made in the company submission, which demonstrated significant uncertainty regarding the OS gains from crizotinib. The ERG reconfigured the economic model so that duration of therapy was based on the area under the curve analysis of the PROFILE 1014 trial, dramatically increasing the cost associated with implementing crizotinib and consequently, substantially increasing the ICER. At the first appraisal meeting, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that crizotinib, while clinically effective, was not sufficiently cost effective for use in the UK NHS. Following the consultation, the company offered a revised PAS and conducted extensive re-analysis, resulting in a revised base-case ICER of 47,291 pound per QALY gained. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that crizotinib was likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources, despite the uncertainty that persisted around a number of factors, namely the long-term survival benefit of crizotinib. Crizotinib was therefore recommended as an option for untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in adults.","[Morgan, Philip; Woolacott, Nerys; Biswas, Mousumi; Mebrahtu, Teumzghi; Harden, Melissa; Hodgson, Robert] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Morgan, P (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",philip.morgan@york.ac.uk,"Biswas, Dr. Mousumi/IUM-9021-2023","Mebrahtu, Teumzghi Fisseha/0000-0003-4821-2304; Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893; Biswas, Mousumi/0000-0001-6781-7400",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/121/10]; National Institute for Health Research [EoH-2014-03-07-103] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 15/121/10) and will be published as part of a compendium of ERG articles in Health Technology Assessment.

(Int J Game Theory 21(1):27-39, 1992) proved that the core is included in the set of the weighted Shapley values in TU games. The purpose of this paper is to extend this result to NTU games. We first show that the core is included in the closure of the positively weighted egalitarian solutions introduced by Kalai and Samet (Econometrica 53(2):307-327, 1985). Next, we show that the weighted version of the Shapley NTU value by Shapley (La Decision, aggregation et dynamique des ordres de preference, Editions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, pp 251-263, 1969) does not always include the core. These results indicate that, in view of the relationship to the core, the egalitarian solution is a more desirable extension of the weighted Shapley value to NTU games. As a byproduct of our approach, we also clarify the relationship between the core and marginal contributions in NTU games. We show that, if the attainable payoff for the grand coalition is represented as a closed-half space, then any element of the core is attainable as the expected value of marginal contributions.","[Yokote, Koji] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Yokote, K (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",sidehand@toki.waseda.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14J03362] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","K.

The death of one member of a couple can have either deterministic or stochastic effects on the other; our new framework gives an intuitive and flexible pairwise cohort based probabilistic mechanism that can account for both. It is sufficiently flexible to allow modelling of effects that are short-term (called the broken-heart effect) and/or long-term (named life circumstances bereavement). In addition, it can account for the state of health of both the surviving and the dying spouse and can allow for dynamic and asymmetric reactions of varying complexity. Finally, it can accommodate the pairwise dependence of mortality intensities before the first death. Analytical expressions for bivariate survivorship in representative models are given, and their sensitivity analysis is performed for benchmark cases of old and young couples. Simulation and estimation procedures are provided that are straightforward to implement and lead to consistent parameter estimation on synthetic dataset of 10000 pairs of death times for couples.

Results are valid for general utility functions on the real line and semi-martingale models. It is shown that as the position size approaches infinity, the utility function's decay rate for large negative wealths is the primary driver of prices. For utilities with exponential decay, one may price like an exponential investor. For utilities with a power decay, one may price like a power investor after a suitable adjustment to the rate at which the position size becomes large. In a sizable class of diffusion models, limiting indifference prices are explicitly computed for an exponential investor. Furthermore, the large claim limit arises endogenously as the hedging error for the claim vanishes.","[Robertson, Scott] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Robertson, S (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Math Sci, Wean Hall 6113, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",scottrob@andrew.cmu.edu,"Robertson, Scott P/L-3926-2016",,National Science Foundation [DMS-1312419],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The author is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number DMS-1312419.,,45,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

That is, a singleton core is necessary for the existence of competitive equilibria. We also show that a competitive matching exists if and only if the matching produced by the top trading cycles algorithm is feasible, in which case it is the unique competitive matching. Hence, we can use the top trading cycles algorithm to test whether a competitive equilibrium exists and to construct a competitive equilibrium if one exists. Lastly, in the context of bilateral matching problems, we compare the condition for the existence of competitive matchings with existing sufficient conditions for the existence or uniqueness of stable matchings and show that it is weaker than most existing conditions for uniqueness.","[Park, Jaeok] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Park, J (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",jaeok.park@yonsei.ac.kr,"Park, Jaeok/HJP-8771-2023",,,,,,39,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The other axioms include two conditions concerned particularly with the spatial positions of the players, besides spatial versions of anonymity and dummy. The last condition says that dummy players can be left out in a specific way without changing the power of the other players. We show that this condition can be weakened to requiring dummies to have zero power if we add a condition of positional continuity.

Second, it can capture upper and lower tail dependence patterns that are either the same or different. We first prove the full-range tail dependence property, and then we obtain the corresponding extreme value copula. There are two applications based on the proposed copula. The first one is modeling pairwise dependence between financial markets. The second one is modeling dynamic tail dependence patterns that appear in upper and lower tails of a loss-and-expense data.

We also introduce a new adjustment to the test statistic that makes it asymptotically pivotal whether the candidate models are nested or non-nested. The test uses simple standard normal critical values and is shown to be asymptotically similar, to be consistent against all fixed alternatives, and to have non-trivial power against n-1/2-local alternatives.

Empirical results for three stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange indicate that the cojumps of two assets have a significant impact on future covolatility, but the impact is negligible for forecasting weekly and monthly horizons.","[Asai, Manabu] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, 1-236 Tangi Machi, Hachioji, Tokyo 1928577, Japan; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid, Spain; [McAleer, Michael] Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Adv Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Soka University; National Tsing Hua University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Complutense University of Madrid; Yokohama National University,"Asai, M (通讯作者)，Soka Univ, Fac Econ, 1-236 Tangi Machi, Hachioji, Tokyo 1928577, Japan.",m-asai@soka.ac.jp,"Asai, Manabu/D-3044-2011; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008",,"Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [25380271]; Australian Academy of Science; Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Australian Academy of Science; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The authors are most grateful to Yoshi Baba and Karen Lewis, and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter mu to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio.","[Law, T.; Shawe-Taylor, J.] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Law, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",timothy.law.14@ucl.ac.uk,,"Shawe-Taylor, John/0000-0002-2030-0073",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1499038] Funding Source: researchfish,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).,,26,40,41,5,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the locally linear CBD model, in which the drifts that govern the expected mortality trend are allowed to follow a stochastic process. This specification results in median forecasts that are more consistent with the recent trends and more robust relative to changes in the data sample period. It also yields wider prediction intervals that may better reflect the possibilities of future trend changes. The treatment of the drifts as a stochastic process naturally calls for nuga hedging, a method proposed by Cairns (2013) to hedge the risk associated with changes in drifts. To improve the existing nuga-hedging method, we propose a new hedging method which demands less stringent assumptions. The proposed method allows hedgers to extract more hedge effectiveness out of a hedging instrument, and is therefore useful when there are only a few traded longevity securities in the market.","[Liu, Yanxin] Univ Nebraska, Dept Finance, Lincoln, NE USA; [Li, Johnny Siu-Hang] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Waterloo,"Li, JSH (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",yanxin.liu@unl.edu; shli@uwaterloo.ca,"Liu, Yan-Xin/AAI-3572-2021","Liu, Yan-Xin/0000-0001-5030-2435",Global Risk Institute; Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Programme; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-356050-2013],Global Risk Institute; Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Programme; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This work is supported by the Global Risk Institute, the Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Programme and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant RGPIN-356050-2013).",,58,13,13,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2017,47.0,1,,,,,79,151,,10.1017/asb.2016.33,0.0,,,73,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EH1ZM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391566900003,0

Despite the apparent importance of heterogeneity, a common practice in modern empirical work is to largely ignore it by reporting average partial effects (or, at best, average effects for some groups). While average effects provide very convenient scalar summaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire variety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much more fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects-a collection of estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by percentiles. By construction, the sorted effect curves completely represent and help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot. They are as convenient and easy to report in practice as the conventional average partial effects. They also serve as a basis for classification analysis, where we divide the observational units into most or least affected groups and summarize their characteristics. We provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard errors and confidence bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related classification analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least affected groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate sorting operator and a related classification operator, which are of independent interest. We apply the sorted effects method and classification analysis to demonstrate several striking patterns in the gender wage gap. We find that this gap is particularly strong for married women, ranging from -60% to 0% between the 2% and 98% percentiles, as a function of observed and unobserved characteristics; while the gap for never married women ranges from -40% to +20%. The most adversely affected women tend to be married, do not have college degrees, work in sales, and have high levels of potential experience.","[Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fernandez-Val, Ivan] BU, Dept Econ, Boston, MA USA; [Luo, Ye] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Hong Kong,"Chernozhukov, V (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",vchern@mit.edu; ivanf@bu.edu; kurtluo@hku.hk,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the coeditor, three anonymous referees, Alberto Abadie, Daron Acemoglu, Isaiah Andrews, Joshua Angrist, Debopam Bhattacharya, Jaroslav Borovicka, Kasey Buckles, Denis Chetverikov, Jerry Hausman, Tetsuya Kaji, Pat Kline, Roger Koenker, Siyi Luo, Maddie McKelway, Anna Mikusheva, Whitney Newey, Claudia Olivetti, Andres Santos, Camille Terrier, Frank Windmeijer, Abigail Wozniak, and seminar participants at multiple institutions for helpful discussions.

Northern Vietnam (Dai Viet) was ruled by a strong, centralized state in which the village was the fundamental administrative unit. Southern Vietnam was a peripheral tributary of the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire, which followed a patron-client model with more informal, personalized power relations and no village intermediation. Using a regression discontinuity design, the study shows that areas exposed to Dai Viet administrative institutions for a longer period prior to French colonization have experienced better economic outcomes over the past 150 years. Rich historical data document that in Dai Viet villages, citizens have been better able to organize for public goods and redistribution through civil society and local government. We argue that institutionalized village governance crowded in local cooperation and that these norms persisted long after the original institutions disappeared.","[Dell, Melissa] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dell, Melissa] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lane, Nathan] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Lane, Nathan] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Querubin, Pablo] NYU, Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Monash University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); New York University,"Dell, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Dell, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",melissadell@fas.harvard.edu; nathaniel.lane@monash.edu; pablo.querubin@nyu.edu,"Lane, Nathaniel/AAU-8900-2021","Lane, Nathaniel/0000-0003-0725-8621",Weatherhead Center for International Affairs (Harvard); Milton Fund (Harvard),Weatherhead Center for International Affairs (Harvard); Milton Fund (Harvard),"We thank Minh Trinh, Nhung Le, Minh Tuan Nguyen, Thao Ngo, and Huyen Cao for providing excellent research assistance.

Stiripentol is approved for use in Canada for treatment of Dravet syndrome, but the associated long-term costs and benefits have not been well-studied and its cost effectiveness is unclear.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of stiripentol as an adjunctive treatment to clobazam and valproate for treatment of Dravet syndrome from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare payer.MethodsA cost-utility analysis was performed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with adjunctive stiripentol treatment compared with clobazam and valproate alone in children with Dravet syndrome. Transition probabilities, drug efficacy, utility weights, and costs were obtained from a review of the literature. Probabilistic analyses were conducted using a Markov model with health states related to seizure frequency. A 10-year horizon was used. The incremental cost per QALY gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) for adjunctive use of stiripentol was calculated, and assumptions were explored in scenario analyses. All costs are expressed in 2017 Canadian dollars ($Can).ResultsCompared with clobazam and valproate alone, the adjunctive use of stiripentol is associated with an ICER of $Can151,310. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can50,000, the probability that stiripentol was the optimal treatment was 5.2%. The cost of stiripentol would need to be reduced by 61.4% for stiripentol to be cost effective.ConclusionFrom the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare payer, stiripentol is not cost effective at its current price at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $Can50,000. Funding stiripentol will be associated with important opportunity costs that bear consideration.","[Elliott, Jesse; Clifford, Tammy; Wells, George A.; Coyle, Doug] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [McCoy, Blathnaid] Univ Toronto, Dept Paediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [McCoy, Blathnaid] Hosp Sick Children, Div Neurol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Clifford, Tammy] CADTH, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Wells, George A.] Univ Ottawa, Cardiovasc Res Methods Ctr, Heart Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute,"Elliott, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",jcrai065@uottawa.ca,,"Coyle, Doug/0000-0003-3492-2268",Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"JE is supported by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship and is a trainee in the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Cross-Disciplinary Training (DSECT) program, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",,31,10,10,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1253,1261,,10.1007/s40273-018-0669-7,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29761351.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800007,0

Combination therapies have yielded better survival outcomes than GEM alone. A sponsor-independent economic evaluation of these regimens has not been conducted for USA.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to estimate the cost utility and cost effectiveness of these regimens from the payer perspective for USA.MethodsA three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed disease, death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years; life-years) was developed to estimate the incremental cost-utility and cost-effectiveness ratios. FOLFIRINOX clinical data were obtained from trial and indirect estimates were obtained from network meta-analyses. Lifetime horizon and 3%/year discount rates were used.ResultsFOLFIRINOX was the most expensive regimen and GEM the least costly regimen. Compared to GEM, all but one (CIS+GEM) regimen were found to be more effective in quality-adjusted life-years and life-years. Compared to GEM, the incremental cost-utility ratios for CAP+GEM, OX-GEM, NAB-P+GEM, and FOLFIRINOX, were US$180,503, US$197,993, US$204,833, and US$265,718 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, respectively; and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were US$88,181, US$87,620, US$135,683, and US$167,040 per additional life-year, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis.ConclusionsThis sponsor-independent economic evaluation for USA found that OX+GEM, CAP+GEM, FOLFIRINOX, and NAB-P+GEM, but not CIS+GEM, were more expensive but also more effective than GEM alone in terms of quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained. The NAB-P+GEM regimen appears to be the most cost effective in USA at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$200,000/quality-adjusted life-year.","[Gharaibeh, Mahdi; Slack, Marion; Erstad, Brian; Alsaid, Nimer; Bootman, J.

In a structural version of this model where the driver variables of the STUR coefficient are endogenous, the NLLS estimate of the STUR parameter is inconsistent, as are the corresponding estimates of the associated covariance parameters. This paper develops a nonlinear instrumental variable (NLIV) as well as GMM estimators of the STUR parameter which conveniently addresses endogeneity. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the NLIV and GMM estimators and establish consistency under similar orthogonality and relevance conditions to those used in the linear model. An overidentification test and its asymptotic distribution are also developed. The results enable inference about structural STUR models and a mechanism for testing the local STUR model against a simple UR null, which complements usual UR tests. Simulations reveal that the asymptotic distributions of the NLIV and GMM estimators of the STUR parameter as well as the test for overidentifying restrictions perform well in small samples and that the distribution of the NLIV estimator is heavily leptokurtic with a limit theory which has Cauchy- like tails. Comparisons of STUR coefficient and standard UR coefficient tests show that the one-sided UR test performs poorly against the one-sided STUR coefficient test both as the sample size and departures from the null rise. The results are applied to study the relationships between stock returns and bond spread changes.","[Lieberman, Offer] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Phillips, Peter C.

Our aim is to find socially optimal reinsurance treaties. In our setting we assume that there are n insurance companies, each bearing a certain risk, and one representative reinsurer. The optimization problem is to minimize the sum of all capital requirements of the insurers where we assume that all insurance companies use a form of Range-Value-at-Risk. We show that in case all insurers use Value-at-Risk and the reinsurer's premium principle satisfies monotonicity, then layer reinsurance treaties are socially optimal. For this result we do not need any dependence structure between the risks. In the general setting with Range-Value-at-Risk we obtain again the optimality of layer reinsurance treaties under further assumptions, in particular under the assumption that the individual risks are positively dependent through the stochastic ordering. Our results include the findings in Chi and Tan (2013) in the special case n = 1. At the end, we discuss the difference between socially optimal reinsurance treaties and individually optimal ones by looking at a number of special cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In such models, groups with different compositions of individuals generally co-exist and the reproductive success (fitness) of a specific strategy varies with the frequencies of different group types. These frequencies crucially depend on the matching process. For arbitrary matching processes (called matching rules), we study Nash equilibrium and ESS in the associated population game and show that several results that are known to hold for population games under uniform random matching carry through to our setting. In our most novel contribution, we derive results on the efficiency of the Nash equilibria of population games and show that for any (fixed) payoff structure, there always exists some matching rule leading to average fitnessmaximization. Finally, we provide a series of applications to commonly studied normal-form games.","[Jensen, Martin Kaae] Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Rigos, Alexandros] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",University of Surrey; Lund University,"Jensen, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford, Surrey, England.",m.k.jensen@surrey.ac.uk,,"Rigos, Alexandros/0000-0003-3787-5030",,,,,49,10,13,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Objective The objective of the study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of these drugs in patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type (i.e. non-mutated) metastatic colorectal cancer, not eligible for liver resection at baseline, from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Methods We constructed a partitioned survival model to evaluate the long-term costs and benefits of cetuximab and panitumumab combined with either FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan) vs. FOLFOX or FOLFIRI alone. The economic analysis was based on three randomised controlled trials. Costs and quality-adjusted lifeyears were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results Based on the evidence available, both drugs fulfil the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's end-of-life criteria. In the analysis, assuming discount prices for the drugs from patient access schemes agreed by the drug manufacturers with the Department of Health, predicted mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for cetuximab ? FOLFOX, panitumumab ? FOLFOX and cetuximab ? FOLFIRI compared with chemotherapy alone appeared cost-effective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's threshold of 50,000per pound quality-adjusted life-year gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments. Conclusion Cetuximab and panitumumab were recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, not eligible for liver resection at baseline, for use within the National Health Service in England.

This allows us to determine optimal reinsurance from joint interests of the insurer and the reinsurer, which is rarely considered in the continuous-time setting. In the Stackelberg game, the reinsurer moves first and the insurer does subsequently to achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium toward optimal reinsurance arrangement. Speaking more precisely, the reinsurer is the leader of the game and decides on an optimal reinsurance premium to charge, while the insurer is the follower of the game and chooses an optimal proportional reinsurance to purchase. Under utility maximization criteria, we study the game problem starting from the general setting with generic utilities and random coefficients to the special case with exponential utilities and constant coefficients. In the special case, we find that the reinsurer applies the variance premium principle to calculate the optimal reinsurance premium and the insurer's optimal ceding/retained proportion of insurance risk depends not only on the risk aversion of itself but also on that of the reinsurer.","[Chen, Lv] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Chen, Lv] East China Normal Univ, Sch Stat, 500 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yang] York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3P 1P3, Canada",University of Waterloo; East China Normal University; York University - Canada,"Shen, Y (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3P 1P3, Canada.",yangshen@yorku.ca,"Shen, Yang/Y-6348-2019","Shen, Yang/0000-0002-0559-2231",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2016-05677]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11501211],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors thank the two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

The new European prudential regulation, namely Solvency II, emphasized the need to use mortality and life tables that best capture and reflect the experienced mortality, and thus policyholders' actual risk profiles, in order to adequately quantify the underlying risk. Therefore, building a mortality table based on the experience of the portfolio is highly recommended and, for this purpose, various approaches have been introduced into actuarial literature. Although such approaches succeed in capturing the main features, it remains difficult to assess the mortality when the underlying portfolio lacks sufficient exposure. In this paper, we propose graduating the mortality curve using an adaptive procedure based on the local likelihood. The latter has the ability to model the mortality patterns even in presence of complex structures and avoids relying on expert opinions. However, such a technique fails to offer a consistent yet regular structure for portfolios with limited deaths. Although the technique borrows the information from the adjacent ages, it is sometimes not sufficient to produce a robust life table. In the presence of such a bias, we propose adjusting the corresponding curve, at the age level, based on a credibility approach. This consists in reviewing the assumption of the mortality curve as new observations arrive. We derive the updating procedure and investigate its benefits of using the latter instead of a sole graduation based on real datasets. Moreover, we look at the divergences in the mortality forecasts generated by the classic credibility approaches including Hardy-Panjer, the Poisson-Gamma model and the Makeham framework on portfolios originating from various French insurance companies.","[Salhi, Yahia; Therond, Pierre-E.] Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, ISFA, EA2429,Lab Sci Actuarielle & Financiere, 50 Ave Tony Garnier, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Therond, Pierre-E.] Galea & Associes, 25 Rue Choiseul, F-75002 Paris, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Thérond, PE (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, ISFA, EA2429,Lab Sci Actuarielle & Financiere, 50 Ave Tony Garnier, F-69007 Lyon, France.;Thérond, PE (通讯作者)，Galea & Associes, 25 Rue Choiseul, F-75002 Paris, France.",yahia.salhi@univ-lyon1.fr; pierre@therond.fr,,"SALHI, Yahia/0000-0001-7221-8146",BNP Paribas Cardif Chair Data Analytics & Models in Insurance; ANR project LoLitA [ANR-13-BS01-0011],BNP Paribas Cardif Chair Data Analytics & Models in Insurance; ANR project LoLitA(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work has been supported by the BNP Paribas Cardif Chair Data Analytics & Models in Insurance and the ANR project LoLitA (ANR-13-BS01-0011).

Specific attention is paid to martingales in [0, 1]. One of these martingales proves to be analytically tractable. It is shown that up to shifting and rescaling constants, it is the only martingale (with the trivial constant, Brownian motion, and geometric Brownian motion) having a separable diffusion coefficient sigma(t,y)=g(t)h(y) and that can be obtained via a time-homogeneous mapping of Gaussian diffusions.

Here we use the same model framework to identify individuals who play key role in some sense. In particular we will focus on expert selection in social networks. Ethnic groups and expert groups need completely different approaches and different type of selection rules are successful for one and for the other. We argue that stability is a key property in expert selection. The idea is that experts are more effective in identifying each other, thus the selected individuals should support each other's membership. We propose a parametric algorithm based on the so called top candidate relation. The parameter expresses how permissive we want to be in expert selection. The two limit cases are the stable set and the top candidate core. The former contains virtually everybody that can be considered as an expert, while the latter consists of the elite. We establish an axiomatization to show that the algorithm is theoretically well-founded. Furthermore we present a case study using citation data to demonstrate its effectiveness. We compare its performance with classical centrality measures.","[Sziklai, Balazs] Hungarian Acad Sci, Game Theory Res Grp, Ctr Econ & Reg Sci, Budaorsi 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Sziklai, Balazs] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest,"Sziklai, B (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Game Theory Res Grp, Ctr Econ & Reg Sci, Budaorsi 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.;Sziklai, B (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",sziklai.balazs@krtk.mta.hu,"Sziklai, Balazs/F-6859-2015","Sziklai, Balazs/0000-0002-0068-8920",New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities [UNKP-16-4-I]; OTKA [K119930]; Hungarian Academy of Sciences under its Momentum Programme [LD-004/2010]; Pallas Athene Domus Scientiae Foundation,New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities; OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Hungarian Academy of Sciences under its Momentum Programme; Pallas Athene Domus Scientiae Foundation,"The author would like to thank Laszlo A.

The popularity of learning models has recently increased amongst applied economists and policy makers who seek to estimate them empirically. Yet the econometrics of learning models is largely uncharted territory. We consider two prominent learning algorithms, namely constant gain and decreasing gain learning. For each of the two learning rules, our analysis proceeds in two stages. First, the paper derives the asymptotic properties of agents' expectations. At the second stage, the paper derives the asymptotics of OLS in the structural model, taking the first stage learning dynamics as given. In the case of constant gain learning, the structural model effectively amounts to a stationary, cointegrating, or co-explosiveness regression. With decreasing gain learning, the regressors are asymptotically collinear such that OLS does not satisfy, in general, the Grenander conditions for consistent estimability. Nevertheless, this paper shows that the OLS estimator remains consistent in all models considered. It also shows, however, that its asymptotic distribution, and hence any inference based upon it, may be nonstandard.","[Christopeit, Norbert] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Massmann, Michael] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany; [Massmann, Michael] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Bonn; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Massmann, M (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",michael.massmann@whu.edu,,,,,,,69,7,7,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Inspired by the Brownian drift switching model, our model results in a more realistic dynamic behavior of international reserves than the buffer stock model. The new model can capture both the jump behavior in reserve dynamics and the leptokurtic feature of the increment distribution which has a higher peak and two asymmetric heavier tails than the normal distribution. Through the selection of an initial distribution that reflects certain steady state behaviors, the reserve process becomes a regenerative process. This selection enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the total expected discounted cost of managing reserves, thus helping us to numerically find management strategies that minimize costs. The numerical results show that shocks at the reserve level have a significant effect on reserve management strategies and that model misspecification can result in nonnegligible additional costs.","[Cai, Ning] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xuewei] Nanjing Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Nanjing University,"Yang, XW (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Int Ctr Management Sci & Engn, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xwyang@nju.edu.cn,"YANG, XUEWEI/C-8052-2011","YANG, XUEWEI/0000-0002-9769-3119","UGC-Infra-Structure Grant [FSGRF14EG56]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201074, 71271109, 71401071]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities",UGC-Infra-Structure Grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the constructive and insightful comments provided by two anonymous reviewers, the Associate Editor, Professor Jaksa Cvitanic (the Co-Editor), and Professor Jerome Detemple (the Editor).

A systematic search of the following online databases was performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Scopus, Health Technology Assessment, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Web of Science. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they described a decision-analytic model evaluating both the costs and benefits associated with an intervention or prevention for atopic eczema. Data were extracted using a standardised form by two independent reviewers, whilst quality was assessed using the model-specific Philips criteria. Twenty-four models were identified, evaluating either preventions (n = 12) or interventions (n = 12): 14 reported using a Markov modelling approach, four utilised decision trees and one a discrete event simulation, whilst five did not specify the approach. The majority, 22 studies, reported that the intervention was dominant or cost effective, given the assumptions and analytical perspective taken. Notably, the models tended to be short-term (16 used a time horizon of <= 1 year), often providing little justification for the limited time horizon chosen. The methodological and reporting quality of the studies was generally weak, with only seven studies fulfilling more than 50% of their applicable Philips criteria.

The predominant approach in previous studies has been to specify in advance a static decision rule for changing the allocation based on the state of financial markets or the economy. In this article, model predictive control (MPC) is used to dynamically optimize a portfolio based on forecasts of the mean and variance of financial returns from a hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters. There are computational advantages to using MPC when estimates of future returns are updated every time a new observation becomes available, since the optimal control actions are reconsidered anyway. MPC outperforms a static decision rule for changing the allocation and realizes both a higher return and a significantly lower risk than a buy-and-hold investment in various major stock market indices. This is after accounting for transaction costs, with a one-day delay in the implementation of allocation changes, and with zero-interest cash as the only alternative to the stock indices. Imposing a trading penalty that reduces the number of trades is found to increase the robustness of the approach.","[Nystrup, Peter] Sampension, Tuborg Havnevej 14, DK-2900 Hellerup, Denmark; [Nystrup, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Asmussens Alle,Bldg 303B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Lindstrom, Erik] Lund Univ, Ctr Math Sci, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Technical University of Denmark; Lund University,"Nystrup, P (通讯作者)，Sampension, Tuborg Havnevej 14, DK-2900 Hellerup, Denmark.;Nystrup, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Asmussens Alle,Bldg 303B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",pnys@dtu.dk,"Madsen, Henrik/HNQ-0927-2023","Madsen, Henrik/0000-0003-0690-3713; Lindstrom, Erik/0000-0002-6468-2624; Nystrup, Peter/0000-0003-4705-9942",Innovation Fund Denmark [4135-00077B],Innovation Fund Denmark,This work was supported by Innovation Fund Denmark under [grant number 4135-00077B].,,52,27,33,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We present a quasi-model-agnostic approach that is rooted in the existence of some affine model capable of recovering with good accuracy the market yield curve and covariance matrix. As we show, at least one such model exists, and this is all we require for our results to hold. We show that, as a consequence, the theoretical 'value of convexity' purely depends on observable features of the yield curve, and on statistically determinable yield volatilities. We then address the question of whether the theoretical convexity is indeed correctly reflected in the shape of the yield curve. We present empirical results about the predictive power of a strategy based on the discrepancies between the theoretical and the predicted value of convexity. By looking at 30 years of data, we find that neither the strategy of being systematically long or short convexity (and immunized against 'level' and 'slope' risk) would have been profitable. However, a conditional strategy that looks at the difference between the 'implied' and the statistically estimated value of convexity would have identified extended periods during which the proposed approach would have delivered attractive Sharpe Ratios.","[Rebonato, Riccardo] EDHEC, London, England; [Putyatin, Vladislav] Morgan Stanley, London, England",,"Rebonato, R (通讯作者)，EDHEC, London, England.",riccardo.rebonato@edhec.edu,,,,,,,15,3,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Therefore, several models from the literature focus on interaction situations which are characterized by a compact representation of a TU-game, and such that the worth of each coalition can be easily computed. Sometimes, the worth of each coalition is computed from the values of single players by means of a mechanism describing how the individual abilities interact within groups of players. In this paper we introduce the class of Generalized additive games (GAGs), where the worth of a coalition is evaluated by means of an interaction filter, that is a map which returns the valuable players involved in the cooperation among players in S. Moreover, we investigate the subclass of basic GAGs, where the filter selects, for each coalition S, those players that have friends but not enemies in S. We show that well-known classes of TU-games can be represented in terms of such basic GAGs, and we investigate the problem of computing the core and the semivalues for specific families of GAGs.","[Cesari, Giulia; Lucchetti, Roberto] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, Milan, Italy; [Cesari, Giulia] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France; [Moretti, Stefano] Univ Paris 09, CNRS, UMR7243, PSL, Paris, France",Polytechnic University of Milan; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Cesari, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Matemat, Milan, Italy.;Cesari, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Paris, France.",giulia.cesari@polimi.it,,,Project CoCoRICo-CoDec of the French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-14-CE24-0007]; Project NETLEARN of the French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-INFR-004],Project CoCoRICo-CoDec of the French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Project NETLEARN of the French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),We thank two anonymous referees and the Associate Editor for their valuable suggestions and comments on a former version of this paper.

Within a time iteration or value function iteration setup, we interpolate functions using an adaptive sparse grid algorithm. With increasing dimensions, sparse grids grow much more slowly than standard tensor product grids. Moreover, adaptivity adds a second layer of sparsity, as grid points are added only where they are most needed, for instance, in regions with steep gradients or at nondifferentiabilities. To further speed up the solution process, our implementation is fully hybrid parallel, combining distributed and shared memory parallelization paradigms, and thus permits an efficient use of high-performance computing architectures. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we solve two very different types of dynamic models: first, high-dimensional international real business cycle models with capital adjustment costs and irreversible investment; second, multiproduct menu-cost models with temporary sales and economies of scope in price setting.","[Brumm, Johannes] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Scheidegger, Simon] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Zurich,"Brumm, J (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Karlsruhe, Germany.",johannes.brumm@gmail.com; simon.scheidegger@uzh.ch,,,Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) [s555]; ERC; Hoover Institution; PASC,Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Hoover Institution; PASC,"We thank a co-editor and four anonymous referees for their extremely valuable comments and suggestions.

Their estimates are typically derived from individual patient-level data collected as part of clinical studies the follow-up duration of which is often too short to allow a robust quantification of the likely costs and benefits a technology will yield over the patient's entire lifetime. In the absence of long-term data, some form of temporal extrapolation-to project short-term evidence over a longer time horizon-is required. Temporal extrapolation inevitably involves assumptions regarding the behaviour of the quantities of interest beyond the time horizon supported by the clinical evidence. Unfortunately, the implications for decisions made on the basis of evidence derived following this practice and the degree of uncertainty surrounding the validity of any assumptions made are often not fully appreciated. The issue is compounded by the absence of methodological guidance concerning the extrapolation of non-time-to-event outcomes such as costs and utilities. This paper considers current approaches to predict long-term costs and utilities, highlights some of the challenges with the existing methods, and provides recommendations for future applications. It finds that, typically, economic evaluation models employ a simplistic approach to temporal extrapolation of costs and utilities. For instance, their parameters (e.g. mean) are typically assumed to be homogeneous with respect to both time and patients' characteristics. Furthermore, costs and utilities have often been modelled to follow the dynamics of the associated time-to-event outcomes. However, cost and utility estimates may be more nuanced, and it is important to ensure extrapolation is carried out appropriately for these parameters.","[Bojke, Laura; Manca, Andrea; Asaria, Miqdad; Mahon, Ronan; Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Ren, Shijie] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Sheffield,"Bojke, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",laura.bojke@york.ac.uk,"Asaria, Miqdad/T-9980-2019","Asaria, Miqdad/0000-0002-3538-4417; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124",Health Economics and Outcome Measurement (HEOM) Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR - CLAHRC YH),Health Economics and Outcome Measurement (HEOM) Theme of the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Yorkshire and Humber (NIHR - CLAHRC YH),"Work contributing to this manuscript was conducted as part of a Medical Research Council (MRC) grant Methods of extrapolating RCT evidence for economic evaluation'', although this manuscript was not prepared during the time of this grant.

We do not place any restrictions on how players' behavior deviates from rationality, but rather, on players' higher-order beliefs about the frequency of such deviations. We assume that there exists a probability p such that all players believe, with at least probability p, that their opponents play rationally. This, together with the assumption of a common prior, leads to what we call the set of p-rational outcomes, which we define and characterize for arbitrary probability p. We then show that this set varies continuously in p and converges to the set of correlated equilibria as p approaches 1, thus establishing robustness of the correlated equilibrium concept to relaxing rationality and common knowledge of rationality. The p-rational outcomes are easy to compute, also for games of incomplete information. Importantly, they can be applied to observed frequencies of play for arbitrary normal-form games to derive a measure of rationality that bounds from below the probability with which any given player chooses actions consistent with payoff maximization and common knowledge of payoff maximization.","[Germano, Fabrizio] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Germano, Fabrizio] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona GSE, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Zuazo-Garin, Peio] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Fdn Econ Anal 1, BRIDGE Grp, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; University of Basque Country,"Germano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Germano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona GSE, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",fabrizio.germano@upf.edu; peio.zuazo@ehu.eus,"Germano, Fabrizio/AGY-5905-2022; Germano, Fabrizio/A-3854-2013; Zuazo-Garin, Peio/M-3042-2017","Germano, Fabrizio/0000-0002-6211-4519; Germano, Fabrizio/0000-0002-6211-4519; Zuazo-Garin, Peio/0000-0001-8099-2262","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-59225-P, ECO2012-31326]; Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2009-11213]; Basque Government [IT568-13, POS-2015-1-0022]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE Research Network; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government),"Earlier versions of this paper circulated under the title Approximate Knowledge of Rationality and Correlated Equilibria.

The mortality dynamics is formulated as a large, first order vector autoregressive model which encompasses standard factor models such as the Lee and Carter (1992) model. Sparsity and smoothness constraints are then introduced, based on the idea that the nearer the two ages, the more important the dependence between mortalities at these ages. Our model has several novelties. First, it ensures that in the long-run, mortality rates at different ages do not diverge. Second, it provides a natural explanation of the so-called cohort effect without identifiability difficulties. Third, the model is easily extended to the multiple-population case in a coherent way. Finally, themodel is associated with a closed form, non-parametric estimation method: the penalized least square, which ensures spatial smoothness of the age-dependent parameters. Using US and UK mortality data, we find that our model produces reasonable projected mortality profile in the long-run, as well as satisfying short-run out-of-sample forecast performance.","[Li, Hong] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tongyan Rd 38, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Li, Hong; Lu, Yang] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13001 Marseille, France",Nankai University; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Lu, Y (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13001 Marseille, France.",hong.li@nankai.edu.cn; luyang000278@gmail.com,"Lu, Yang/O-3500-2018","Lu, Yang/0000-0002-7141-1048",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61673225],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Hong Li acknowledges the support of National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 61673225.",,41,36,38,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2017,47.0,2,,,,,563,600,,10.1017/asb.2016.37,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EU6ML,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401148000008,0

This situation has existed for many years, but has become more common in recent years because of heavier trading. Surprisingly, there have been few studies on this important issue, in spite of some ad hoc approaches to treat multiple transactions. In this paper we investigate how to handle multiple transactions, particularly in the context of estimating the integrated volatility and integrated quarticity, which are of great interest in financial econometrics. Two approaches are proposed for this purpose, and their asymptotic properties are investigated. Their performances are confirmed by simulation studies. The estimators are also applied to some real world problems. The work represents only the first step in this direction, and some future research problems are discussed.","[Jing, Bing-Yi] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi] Univ Macau, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi] UMacau Zhuhai Res Inst, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Kong, Xin-Bing] Soochow Univ, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; University of Macau; Soochow University - China,"Liu, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Liu, Z (通讯作者)，UMacau Zhuhai Res Inst, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liuzhi@umac.mo,,,"Hong Kong RGC [HKUST6019/10P, HKUST6019/12P, HKUST6022/13P]; FDCT of Macau [078/2012/A3, 078/2013/A3]; NSFC [11401607, 11201080]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Chinese Ministry of Education [12YJC910003]",Hong Kong RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); FDCT of Macau; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Chinese Ministry of Education,"Jing's research is partially supported by Hong Kong RGC HKUST6019/10P, HKUST6019/12P, and HKUST6022/13P.

Objective The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of nintedanib versus pirfenidone, N-acetylcysteine and best supportive care (BSC) for the treatment of IPF from a UK payer's perspective. Methods A Markov model was designed to capture the changes in the condition of adults with IPF. Efficacy outcomes included mortality, lung function decline and acute exacerbations. Treatment safety (serious adverse events) and tolerability (overall discontinuation) were also considered. The baseline risk of these events was derived from patient-level data from the placebo arms of nintedanib clinical trials (TOMORROW, INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2). A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to estimate the relative effectiveness of the comparator treatments. Quality of life and healthcare resource use data from the clinical trials were also incorporated in the economic model. Results Nintedanib showed statistically significant differences against placebo on acute exacerbation events avoided and lung function decline. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the results were split between two treatments with relative low costs and modest effectiveness (BSC and N-acetylcysteine) and two that showed improved effectiveness (lung function) and higher costs (nintedanib and pirfenidone). All comparators were assumed to have similar projected survival and the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was driven by the acute exacerbations and lung function estimates. In the base-case deterministic pairwise comparison with pirfenidone, nintedanib was found to have fewer acute exacerbations and resulted in less costs and more QALYs gained. Conclusions Compared with BSC (placebo), nintedanib and pirfenidone were the only treatments to show statistical significance in the efficacy parameters. We found substantial uncertainty in the overall cost-effectiveness results between nintedanib and pirfenidone. N-Acetylcysteine was largely similar to BSC but with a worse survival profile.

A summary of their cost effectiveness versus other available treatments was required. Objective Our objective was to systematically review the published cost-effectiveness studies of insulin analogues for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods We searched major databases and health technology assessment agency reports for economic evaluation studies published up until 30 September 2015. Two reviewers performed data extraction and assessed the quality of the data using the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) guidelines. Results Seven of the included studies assessed short-acting insulin analogues, 12 assessed biphasic insulin analogues, 30 assessed long-acting insulin analogues and one assessed a combination of short- and long-acting insulin analogues. Only 17 studies involved patients with T1DM, all were modelling studies and 12 were conducted in Canada. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for short-acting insulin analogues ranged from dominant to $US435,913 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, the ICERs for biphasic insulin analogues ranged from dominant to $US57,636 per QALY gained and the ICERs for long-acting insulin analogues ranged from dominant to $US599,863 per QALY gained. A total of 15 studies met all the CHEERS guidelines reporting quality criteria. Only 26 % of the studies assessed heterogeneity in their analyses. Conclusion Current evidence indicates that insulin analogues are cost effective for T1DM; however, evidence for their use in T2DM is not convincing. Additional evidence regarding compliance and efficacy is required to support the broader use of long-acting and biphasic insulin analogues in T2DM. The value of insulin analogues depends strongly on reductions in hypoglycaemia event rates and its efficacy in lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)).","[Shafie, Asrul Akmal; Ng, Chin Hui; Tan, Yui Ping] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Discipline Social & Adm Pharm, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Practice, Ctr Pharmaceut Outcomes Res, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, 425 N Charter St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Naresuan University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Queensland,"Shafie, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Discipline Social & Adm Pharm, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",aakmal@usm.my,"Shafie, Asrul Akmal/F-7026-2010","Shafie, Asrul Akmal/0000-0002-5629-9270; TAN, YUI PING/0000-0001-7097-8336; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn/0000-0003-4572-8794; ng, chin hui/0000-0002-5239-2072",,,,,80,12,14,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2017,35.0,2,,,,,141,162,,10.1007/s40273-016-0456-2,0.0,,,22,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EJ3LU,27752998.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393114500002,0

Hedging pressure in commodity futures markets and momentum effects is also considered. This study combines these factors to discuss their importance in explaining commodity future returns, while the literature has studied these factors separately. One of the important pricing factors in equity and bond markets is liquidity, but its role as a pricing factor in commodity futures markets has not yet been studied. To our knowledge, this research is the first to study liquidity as a pricing factor in commodity futures. The risk premiums of two momentum factors and speculators' hedging pressure range from 2% to 3% per month and are greater than the risk premiums of roll yield (0.8%) and liquidity (0.5%).

Algebraic modeling languages are very well suited for prototyping and developing optimization models. All the financial optimization models have been implemented in AMPL mathematical programming modeling language and solved using either Gurobi Optimizer or Knitro (for those models having general nonlinear objectives). This proposed software library includes several well-known portfolio allocation models, such as the Markowitz mean-variance model, the Konno-Yamazaki absolute deviation model, the Black-Litterman model, Young's minimax model and others. These models aim either to minimize the variance of the portfolios, or maximize the expected returns subject to a number of constraints, or include portfolios with a risk-free asset, transaction costs, and others. Furthermore, we also present a literature review of financial optimization software packages and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of our proposed portfolio allocation model library.

A model is recommended in the paper, with the help of which difficult utility-based estimations can be reduced into a preference-based weighting. The latter is proven to be satisfactory and meanwhile includes the decision-makers' preference structure. The model substitutes a non-additive multi-attribute utility function with an additive one but the number of attributes increase in return, which is still considered as a less difficult method. In the last chapter we introduce the results of a non-representative test of the elaborated model in a case study form.

Clinician involvement can help modellers to develop clinically valid but straightforward structures; however, there is little guidance available on methods for clinician input to model structure. This study aims to provide an in-depth exploration of clinician involvement in structural development, highlighting key issues and generating recommendations to optimise practices.MethodsA qualitative study was undertaken with a range of modellers and clinicians working in different modelling contexts. In-depth interviews and case studies using observations were carried out to understand how clinicians are involved in model structural development and to identify problems and optimal approaches from informants' perspectives.ResultsTwenty-four interviews and two case studies were undertaken with modellers and modelling teams. Key issues included the number and diversity of clinicians contributing to structural development, potentially impacting the generalisability of structures, and problems with clinician understanding of important information to contribute to model pathways. Modellers and clinicians suggested that clinician training in modelling could enhance structural processes.ConclusionsRecommendations to optimise current practices include recruiting clinicians from a variety of backgrounds and using discussions between experts to develop valid and generalisable structures. Future research should focus on developing training materials for clinicians and finding ways to help modellers recruit clinicians from different settings.","[Husbands, Samantha; Coast, Joanna] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, 1-5 Whiteladies Rd, Bristol BS8 1NU, Avon, England; [Jowett, Susan; Barton, Pelham] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Bristol; University of Birmingham,"Husbands, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, 1-5 Whiteladies Rd, Bristol BS8 1NU, Avon, England.",Samantha.husbands@bristol.ac.uk,"Jowett, Sue/AAO-4198-2021","Jowett, Sue/0000-0001-8936-3745; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166",University of Birmingham; Universitas 21,University of Birmingham; Universitas 21,"Financial support for this study was provided in part by a scholarship from the University of Birmingham, and in part by a PhD Scholarship from Universitas 21 for the Canadian element of the work.",,35,6,6,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12,,,,,1453,1462,,10.1007/s40273-018-0705-7,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30117116.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451183300006,0

We analysed what developments are expected in precision medicine over the next decade and considered the implications for health technology assessment (HTA) agencies.MethodsWe performed a pragmatic literature search to account for the large size and wide scope of the precision medicine literature. We refined and enriched these results with a series of expert interviews up to 1h in length, including representatives from HTA agencies, research councils and researchers designed to cover a wide spectrum of precision medicine applications and research.ResultsWe identified 31 relevant papers and interviewed 13 experts. We found that three types of precision medicine are expected to emerge in clinical practice: complex algorithms, digital health applications and omics'-based tests. These are expected to impact upon each stage of the HTA process, from scoping and modelling through to decision-making and review. The complex and uncertain treatment pathways associated with patient stratification and fast-paced technological innovation are central to these effects.DiscussionInnovation in precision medicine promises substantial benefits but will change the way in which some health services are delivered and evaluated. The shelf life of guidance may decrease, structural uncertainty may increase and new equity considerations will emerge. As biomarker discovery accelerates and artificial intelligence-based technologies emerge, refinements to the methods and processes of evidence assessments will help to adapt and maintain the objective of investing in healthcare that is value for money.","[Love-Koh, James; Peel, Alison; Ennis, Kate; Wood, Hannah; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Love-Koh, James; Manca, Andrea] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos; Lovett, Rosemary] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ennis, Kate] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Manca, Andrea] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Chalkidou, Anastasia] Kings Technol Evaluat Ctr, London, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of Liverpool; Luxembourg Institute of Health,"Love-Koh, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Love-Koh, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",james.love-koh@york.ac.uk,"Nasarian, Elham/ISB-6863-2023; owoyele, babajide/AAD-7054-2020; Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos/AFQ-4095-2022; Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023","owoyele, babajide/0000-0002-3688-5248; Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-0680-7353; Ennis, Kate/0000-0003-4284-217X",NICE,NICE,This project was funded by NICE.,,78,62,64,6,25,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12,,,,,1439,1451,,10.1007/s40273-018-0686-6,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30003435.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451183300005,0

Each asset price can hit 0; we only exclude that this ever happens simultaneously for all assets. We start from two simple, economically motivated axioms, namely, absence of arbitrage (in the sense of NUPBR) and absence of relative arbitrage among all buy-and-hold strategies (called static efficiency). A valuation process for a payoff is then called semi-efficient consistent if the financial market enlarged by that process still satisfies this combination of properties. It turns out that this approach lies in the middle between the extremes of valuing by risk-neutral expectation and valuing by absence of arbitrage alone. We show that this always yields put-call parity, although put and call values themselves can be nonunique, even for complete markets. We provide general formulas for put and call values in complete markets and show that these are symmetric and that both contain three terms in general. We also show that our approach recovers all the put-call parity respecting valuation formulas in the classic theory as special cases, and we explain when and how the different terms in the put and call valuation formulas disappear or simplify. Along the way, we also define and characterize completeness for general semimartingale financial markets and connect this to the classic theory.","[Herdegen, Martin] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Ramphal Bldg R2-37, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Schweizer, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Math, HG G51-2,Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweizer, Martin] Swiss Finance Inst, Walchestr 9, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Warwick; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Schweizer, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Math, HG G51-2,Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.schweizer@math.ethz.ch,,,"Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [SNF 105218_150101]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [105218_150101] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","We gratefully acknowledge financial support by the Swiss Finance Institute (SFI) and the National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management).

I discuss how these decisions are typically made and argue that the amount of sample data and regulatory authorities' concerns over multiplicity are irrelevant when making reimbursement decisions. Decision analytic models (DAMs) are usually necessary to meet the requirements of an economic evaluation. DAMs involve inputs relating to health benefits and resource use that represent unknown true population parameters. Evidence about parameters may come from a variety of sources, including RCTs, and uncertainty about parameters is represented by their joint posterior distribution. Any impact of multiplicity is mitigated through the prior distribution. I illustrate my perspective with three examples: the estimation of a treatment effect on a rare event; the number of RCTs available in a meta-analysis; and the estimation of population mean overall survival. I conclude by recommending that reimbursement decisions should be followed by an assessment of the value of sample information and the DAM revised structurally as necessary and to include any new sample data that may be generated.","[Stevens, John W.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Stevens, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",j.w.stevens@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1135,1141,,10.1007/s40273-018-0681-y,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29926358.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800001,0

The surplus process of the considered insurance entity is assumed to follow a Brownian motion with drift. The changes in the interest rate are described via a Markov-switching process. It turns out that in times with a positive rate, it is optimal to inject capital only if the company becomes insolvent. However, if the rate is negative it might be optimal to hold a strictly positive reserve. We establish an algorithm for finding the value function and the optimal strategy, which is proved to be of barrier type.

In this paper, we consider dynamic hedge strategies using the one-factor and two-factor Hull White models, based on results for the liability valuation fromHardy et al. (2014). The strategies utilise simple hedge portfolios combining one or two zero-coupon bonds, and a money market account. We assess the effectiveness of the strategies by considering how accurately each one would have hedged a 5-year cash balance liability through the past 20 years, using real-world returns and crediting rates, and assuming parameters calibrated using the information available at the time. We show that there is considerable impact of model and parameter uncertainty, with additional, less severe impact from discrete hedging error and transactions costs.

We point out that the objectives of risk capital calculations differ from those of classical reserving and conclude that standard methods of classical reserving focusing on the estimation error of claims reserves are in general not appropriate to model the full impact of parameter uncertainty for the reserve risk. Referring to the requirements of Solvency II we assess different methods to model parameter uncertainty for the reserve risk by comparing the attained probability of solvency with the required confidence level. We provide evidence that the popular bootstrapping approach is not appropriate to model parameter uncertainty for the reserve risk according to this quantitative assessment. For the normal model we present an adaption of the approach proposed in Frohlich and Weng (2015) based on an analytical result and derive a risk capital model attaining the required confidence level in good approximation. Furthermore, for the lognormal model experimental results suggest that even a direct application of the method proposed in Frohlich and Weng (2015) clearly outperforms the bootstrapping approach according to the quantitative criterion mentioned above.

This paper focusses on Ph+ ALL. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group (ERG). This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the company's submission was derived from a phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-comparative study. Given the lack of comparative evidence, a naive indirect comparison was performed against re-induction chemotherapy comparing major cytogenetic response and complete remission. Best supportive care (BSC) was assumed to produce no disease response. Despite the limited evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely to be an effective treatment for patients with Ph+ ALL. The company submitted a state transition model that analysed the incremental cost effectiveness of ponatinib versus re-induction therapy and BSC for the treatment of Ph+ ALL in patients whose disease is resistant to dasatinib, who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate or who have the threonine-315-isoleucine mutation. This population was further subdivided into those who were suitable for allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and those who were not. The company's revised economic evaluation, following the clarification process, estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in those suitable for allo-SCT of 31,123 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ponatinib compared with re-induction chemotherapy and 26,624 pound per QALY gained compared with BSC. For those for whom allo-SCT was unsuitable, the company-estimated ICER compared with BSC was 33,954 pound per QALY gained. Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses that, when combined, produced a range in ICERs (due to uncertainty of the most appropriate overall survival function) of dominant (being less expensive and providing more QALYs) to 11,727 pound per QALY gained compared with re-induction chemotherapy and between 7892 pound and 31,696 pound per QALY gained compared with BSC for those in whom allo-SCT was suitable. For those in whom allo-SCT was not suitable, the ERG estimated that ponatinib was dominant. During the consultation period, the company agreed a revised patient access scheme (PAS) that reduced the ICER ranges to 7156 pound to 29,995 pound per QALY gained versus BSC and to less than 5000 pound per QALY gained versus re-induction chemotherapy. In people for whom allo-SCT was unsuitable, ponatinib dominated BSC. The NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of UK NHS resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the PAS.","[Stevenson, Matt; Pandor, Abdullah; Hamilton, Jean; Stevens, John; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Rawdin, Andrew; Wong, Ruth] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Rowntree, Clare] Univ Wales Hosp, Cardiff CF14 4XN, S Glam, Wales",University of Sheffield; Cardiff University,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Hamilton, Jean/0000-0003-3326-9842",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/51/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 16/51/11).

The study included 3698 Dutch general population respondents, analyzed their responses using a conditional logit model, and compared the values elicited by EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L for different health states. No inconsistencies or illogical ordering of level coefficients were observed in either version. The proportion of severe health states with low values was higher in the EQ-5D-5L than in the EQ-5D-3L, and the proportion of mild/moderate states was lower in the EQ-5D-5L than in the EQ-5D-3L. Moreover, differences were observed in the relative weights of the attributes. Overall distribution of health-state values derived from a large representative sample using the same measurement framework for both versions showed differences between the EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L. However, even small differences in the phrasing (language) of the descriptive system or in the valuation protocol can produce differences in values between these two versions.","[Selivanova, Anna; Buskens, Erik; Krabbe, Paul F.

In wythoff partizan subtraction we take the set A and its complement B from wythoff nim, as the two subtraction sets. As a function of the heap size, the maximum size of the canonical forms grows quickly. However, the value of the heap is either a number or, in reduced canonical form, a switch. We find the switches by using properties of the Fibonacci word and standard Fibonacci representations of integers. Moreover, these switches are invariant under shifts by certain Fibonacci numbers. The values that are numbers, however, are distinct, and we can find their binary representation in polynomial time using a representation of integers as sums of Fibonacci numbers, known as the ternary (or the even) Fibonacci representation.","[Larsson, Urban; McKay, Neil A.; Nowakowski, Richard J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Siegel, Angela A.] Robert Gordon Univ, Garthdee House,Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QB, Scotland",Dalhousie University; Robert Gordon University,"Larsson, U (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math & Stat, POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",urban031@gmail.com; mckay@chebucto.ns.ca; rjn@mathstat.dal.ca; a.a.siegel@rgu.ac.uk,,"Larsson, Urban/0000-0003-3663-1720; Siegel, Angela/0000-0001-9211-1223",Killam Trusts,Killam Trusts,Urban Larsson was partially supported by the Killam Trusts.,,20,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Lately, however, a new therapeutic alternative has become available for the management of this pathology: lesinurad, a urate transporter inhibitor. Objective To objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of lesinurad/allopurinol in comparison with febuxostat as a second-line therapeutic strategy for the management of patients affected by gout and hyperuricemia that did not respond to a first-line therapy based on allopurinol alone. Methods A Markov model was built based on the natural history of the pathology; patients entered the model according to their level of serum uric acid concentration and flowed across it according to their response to the therapy. The analysis was carried out considering the perspective of the Italian National Health Service on a lifetime horizon and 6-month cycles. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a 3.5% yearly rate. The results of the model were expressed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Both a one-way and a multi-way Monte-Carlo analysis were carried out in order to check the robustness of the results achieved. Results The ICER derived from the comparison was equal to (sic)77.53/QALY on the lifetime horizon, as there was a higher level of costs associated with the combination as compared with febuxostat ((sic)10,658.27 vs. (sic)10,645.87, for a differential of (sic)12.40) and a higher level of QALYs achieved (7.77 vs. 7.61, for a differential of 0.16). Conclusions The lesinurad/allopurinol combination is recommended for the treatment of patients affected by gout/hyperuricemia in the Italian Health System as it appears to be cost effective and thus sustainable for the Italian healthcare sector.","[Ruggeri, M.; Basile, M.; Rolli, F.

New adjunctive drug therapies (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) have gained approval in Europe and the USA. Objective In this empirical study, we documented preferences regarding adjuvant drug therapy in apheresis-treated patients with severe familial hypercholesterolemia. MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search to identify patient-relevant outcomes in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia currently undergoing apheresis. Data were used to generate a semi-structured qualitative interview that enabled seven patient-relevant characteristics with three levels each to be identified. For the discrete choice experiment, an experimental design (7 x 3) was generated using NGene Software that consisted of 96 choices divided into eight blocks. The survey was conducted between November 2015 and April 2016 using computer-assisted personal interviews. Results The survey was completed by 348 patients (64.9% male). The random parameter logit estimation showed predominance for the attribute 'reduction of LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) level'. 'Risk of myopathy' and 'frequency of apheresis' dominated next. Within the random parameter logit estimation, all coefficients were significant (P <= 0.01). The latent class analysis identified three patient groups. The first group (126 patients) found 'reduction of LDL-C level in blood' to be most important. This group focused solely on this treatment outcome independently of apheresis frequency or additional injections. The second group (106 patients) focused on three attributes: 'frequency of apheresis', 'risk of myopathy', and 'reduction of LDL-C level in blood'. Respondents clearly considered a high frequency of apheresis to have a negative impact. The third group (116 patients) demonstrated the highest preference for apheresis. These patients have adjusted to apheresis for > 10 years. Conclusion Regarding patient preference, clinical efficacy seems to dominate. Hence, 'reduction of LDC-C in blood' was ranked highest above patient-relevant modes of administration and adverse effects. In the patient groups identified, reduction of apheresis was important for only a subsegment (30%) of patients. Another 30% wanted effective LDL-C reduction by whatever means necessary. Most strikingly, another 30% preferred higher frequencies of apheresis.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Sadler, Andrew; Juhnke, Christin] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Gesundheitsokon & Med Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Sadler, Andrew; Juhnke, Christin] Gesell Empir Beratung GmbH GEB, Denzlingen, Germany; [Dippel, Franz-Werner] Sanofi Deutschland GmbH, Evidenzbasierte Med HEOR, Berlin, Germany",Sanofi-Aventis,"Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, Gesundheitsokon & Med Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.;Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Gesell Empir Beratung GmbH GEB, Denzlingen, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Juhnke, Christin/AAT-1479-2021; Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Juhnke, Christin/0000-0002-3949-0612; Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211","Sanofi Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany","Sanofi Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany","This study was financed by Sanofi Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany.",,57,4,4,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36.0,4,,,,,477,493,,10.1007/s40273-018-0614-9,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29388056.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426901000009,0

Real-world data (RWD) may provide complimentary evidence for relative effectiveness assessments (REAs) and cost-effectiveness assessments (CEAs). This study examines whether RWD is incorporated in health technology assessment (HTA) of melanoma drugs by European HTA agencies, as well as differences in RWD use between agencies and across time. HTA reports published between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016 were retrieved from websites of agencies representing five jurisdictions: England [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)], Scotland [Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC)], France [Haute Autorit, de sant, (HAS)], Germany [Institute for Quality and Efficacy in Healthcare (IQWiG)] and The Netherlands [Zorginstituut Nederland (ZIN)]. A standardized data extraction form was used to extract information on RWD inclusion for both REAs and CEAs. Overall, 52 reports were retrieved, all of which contained REAs; CEAs were present in 25 of the reports. RWD was included in 28 of the 52 REAs (54%), mainly to estimate melanoma prevalence, and in 22 of the 25 (88%) CEAs, mainly to extrapolate long-term effectiveness and/or identify drug-related costs. Differences emerged between agencies regarding RWD use in REAs; the ZIN and IQWiG cited RWD for evidence on prevalence, whereas the NICE, SMC and HAS additionally cited RWD use for drug effectiveness. No visible trend for RWD use in REAs and CEAs over time was observed. In general, RWD inclusion was higher in CEAs than REAs, and was mostly used to estimate melanoma prevalence in REAs or to predict long-term effectiveness in CEAs. Differences emerged between agencies' use of RWD; however, no visible trends for RWD use over time were observed.","[Makady, Amr; Goettsch, Wim] Natl Healthcare Inst ZIN, Eekholt 4, NL-1112 XH Diemen, Netherlands; [Makady, Amr; van Veelen, Ard; de Boer, Anthonius; Klungel, Olaf; Goettsch, Wim] Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Univ Weg 99, NL-3584 CE Utrecht, Netherlands; [Jonsson, Pall] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence NICE, Level 1A,City Tower,Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4BT, Lancs, England; [Moseley, Owen] Healthcare Improvement Scotland, Scottish Med Consortium, Delta House,8th Floor,50 West Nile St, Glasgow G1 2NP, Lanark, Scotland; [D'Andon, Anne] Haute Autorite Sante, 5 Ave Stade France, F-93218 Paris, France; [Hillege, Hans] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Broerstr 5, NL-9712 CP Groningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of Groningen,"Makady, A (通讯作者)，Natl Healthcare Inst ZIN, Eekholt 4, NL-1112 XH Diemen, Netherlands.;Makady, A (通讯作者)，Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Clin Pharmacol, Univ Weg 99, NL-3584 CE Utrecht, Netherlands.",amakady@zinl.nl; ardvanveelen@live.nl; pall.jonsson@nice.org.uk; o.moseley@nhs.net; a.dandon@has-sante.fr; a.deboer@uu.nl; h.hillege@umcg.nl; o.h.klungel@uu.nl; wgoettsch@zinl.nl,,"Jonsson, Pall/0000-0002-1222-5704",,,,,34,54,55,2,8,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,359,368,,10.1007/s40273-017-0596-z,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29214389.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800009,0

When the elasticity of output to intermediate inputs in production is high, star suppliers emerge endogenously.

We propose a unifying theory of production where management resolves a tradeoff between hiring more versus better workers. The span of control or size is therefore intimately intertwined with the sorting pattern. We provide a condition for sorting that captures this tradeoff between the quantity and quality of workers and that generalizes Becker's sorting condition. A system of differential equations determines the equilibrium allocation, the firm size, and wages, and allows us to characterize the allocation of the quality and quantity of labor to firms of different productivity. We show that our model nests a large number of widely used existing models.

We solve this problem by providing an explicit and efficient algorithm which even has applications beyond this paper as it can be used for the dynamic linear approximation of any square-integrable random variable. Implementing the algorithm on the stocks of the Hang Seng Index, we find an average improvement of around 6% in standard deviation of slippage compared to an average trader's execution. We conclude by providing a novel decomposition of the trading risk into that which is intrinsic to the median benchmark and that due to execution.","[Frei, Christoph] Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada; [Westray, Nicholas] Imperial Coll London, Exhibition Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Alberta; Imperial College London,"Frei, C (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada.",cfrei@ualberta.ca,"Frei, Christoph/ABH-3664-2020","Frei, Christoph/0000-0001-7284-3064",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN/402585-2011],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [grant number RGPIN/402585-2011].,,32,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Such models are particularly useful to describe the dynamics of operational losses, and to correctly estimate tail-related risk indicators. However, time-varying dependence structures make it a difficult task. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new Markov-switching generalized additive compound process combining Poisson and generalized Pareto distributions. This flexible model takes into account two important features: on the one hand, we allow all parameters of the compound loss distribution to depend on economic covariates in a flexible way. On the other hand, we allow this dependence to vary over time, via a hidden state process. A simulation study indicates that, even in the case of a short time series, this model is easily and well estimated with a standard maximum likelihood procedure. Relying on this approach, we analyse a novel data-set of 819 losses resulting from frauds at the Italian bank UniCredit. We show that our model improves the estimation of the total loss distribution over time, compared to standard alternatives. In particular, this model provides estimations of the 99.9% quantile that are never exceeded by the historical total losses, a feature particularly desirable for banking regulators.","[Hambuckers, J.; Kneib, T.; Silbersdorff, A.] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Chair Stat, Fac Econ Sci, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Langrock, R.] Bielefeld Univ, Stat & Data Anal Grp, Dept Business Adm & Econ, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Bielefeld,"Hambuckers, J (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Chair Stat, Fac Econ Sci, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jhambuc@uni-goettingen.de,,"Kneib, Thomas/0000-0003-3390-0972",DFG [KN 922/4-2]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [1644],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),T.

The market efficiency and the price discovery of Chinese stock index futures do not deteriorate after these rule changes. Using variance ratio and spectral shape tests, we find that the Chinese index futures market becomes even more efficient after the tightened rules came into effect. Furthermore, by employing Schwarz and Szakmary [J. Futures Markets, 1994, 14(2), 147-167] and Hasbrouck [J. Finance, 1995, 50(4), 1175-1199] price discovery measures, we find that the price discovery function, to some extent, becomes better. This finding is consistent with Stein [J.

The concern was mortality risk, i.e., the risk of premature death. The mortality risk due to a pandemic is similar to the property risk associated with catastrophic events such as earthquakes and hurricanes and the security used to hedge the risk is similar to a CAT bond. This work looks at the incentives associated with insurance linked securities. It considers the trade-offs an insurer or reinsurer faces in selecting a hedging strategy. We compare index and indemnity-based hedging as alternative design choices and ask which is capable of creating the greater value for stakeholders. Additionally, we model an insurer or reinsurer that is subject to insolvency risk, which creates an incentive problem known as the judgment proof problem. The corporate manager is assumed to act in the interests of shareholders and so the judgment proof problem yields a conflict of interest between shareholders and other stakeholders. Given the fact that hedging may improve the situation, the analysis addresses what type of hedging tool would be best. We show that an indemnity-based security tends to worsen the situation, as it introduces an additional incentive problem. Index-based hedging, on the other hand, under certain conditions turns out to be beneficial and therefore dominates indemnity-based strategies. This result is further supported by showing that for the same sufficiently small strike price the current shareholder value is greater with the index-based security than the indemnity-based security.

In essence, all that is required is that the error process driving the random walk possesses a continuous spectral density that is strictly positive. Furthermore, under the same weak assumptions, the limiting distribution of the ADF test is derived under the alternative of stationarity, and a theoretical explanation is given for the well-known empirical fact that the test's power is a decreasing function of the chosen autoregressive order p. The intuitive reason for the reduced power of the ADF test is that, as p tends to infinity, the p regressors become asymptotically collinear.","[Paparoditis, Efstathios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Politis, Dimitris N.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Cyprus; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Paparoditis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Math & Stat, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",stathisp@ucy.ac.cy,,"Paparoditis, Efstathios/0000-0003-1958-781X","NSF [DMS 12-23137, DMS 13-08319]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1223137] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),The research of the second author was partially supported by NSF grants DMS 12-23137 and DMS 13-08319.,,31,33,36,3,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Here, we propose a peak-over-threshold method to identify abrupt liquidity drops from limit order book data and we model the time-series of these illiquidity events across multiple assets as a multivariate Hawkes process. This allows us to quantify both the self-excitation of extreme changes of liquidity in the same asset (illiquidity spirals) and the cross-excitation across different assets (illiquidity spillovers). Applying the method to the MTS sovereign bond market, we find significant evidence for both illiquidity spillovers and spirals. The proportion of shocks explained by illiquidity spillovers roughly doubles from 2011 to 2015, suggesting an increased synchronization of extreme illiquidity across assets.","[Schneider, M.] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schneider, M.; Lillo, F.] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Lillo, F.] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Matemat, Piazza Porta San Donato 5, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Pelizzon, L.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, SAFE, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Pelizzon, L.] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dorsoduro 3246, I-30123 Venice, Italy",Deutsche Bank; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; University of Bologna; Goethe University Frankfurt; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Pelizzon, L (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, SAFE, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.;Pelizzon, L (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dorsoduro 3246, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",pelizzon@safe.uni-frankfurt.de,,,State of Hessen Initiative for Research (LOEWE); Association of Foundations of Banking Origin,State of Hessen Initiative for Research (LOEWE); Association of Foundations of Banking Origin,"An earlier version of this paper was circulated as 'How Has Sovereign Bond Market Liquidity Changed?-an Illiquidity Spillover Analysis'.

The statistical and trading performance of the NNs is benchmarked with the traditional Autoregressive Moving Average models. Next, a novel dynamic asymmetric copula model (NNC) is introduced in order to capture the dependence structure across ETF returns. Based on the above, weekly re-balanced portfolios are obtained and compared using the traditional mean-variance and the mean-CVaR portfolio optimization approach. In terms of the results, PSN outperforms all models in statistical and trading terms. Additionally, the asymmetric skewed t copula statistically outperforms symmetric copulas when it comes to modelling ETF returns dependence. The proposed NNC model leads to significant improvements in the portfolio optimization process, while forecasting covariance accounting for asymmetric dependence between the ETFs also improves the performance of obtained portfolios.","[Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yang] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, RCFMRP, East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Stasinakis, Charalampos; Sermpinis, Georgios] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Shi, Yukun] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Ken Edwards Bldg, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; University of Glasgow; University of Leicester,"Stasinakis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Adam Smith Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Charalampos.Stasinakis@glas-gow.ac.uk,,"Zhao, Yang/0000-0002-7833-1657; Sermpinis, Georgios/0000-0002-7341-8913",,,,,57,9,9,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We propose a nonparametric change-point test statistic based on Kendall's tau. The asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of no change follows from a new U-statistic invariance principle for dependent processes. Assuming a single change-point, we show that the location of the change-point is consistently estimated. Kendall's tau possesses a high efficiency at the normal distribution, as compared to the normal maximum likelihood estimator, Pearson's moment correlation. Contrary to Pearson's correlation coefficient, it shows no loss in efficiency at heavy-tailed distributions, and is therefore particularly suited for financial data, where heavy tails are common. We assume the data ((X-i, Y-i))(i=1, ... , n) to be stationary and P-near epoch dependent on an absolutely regular process. The P-near epoch dependence condition constitutes a generalization of the usually considered L-p-near epoch dependence allowing for arbitrarily heavy-tailed data.

In particular, we introduce the concepts of general-loss (GL) forecast superiority and convex-loss (CL) forecast superiority; and we develop tests for GL (CL) superiority that are based on an out-of-sample generalization of the tests introduced by Linton, Maasoumi, and Whang (2005, Review of Economic Studies 72, 735-765). Our test statistics are characterized by nonstandard limiting distributions, under the null, necessitating the use of resampling procedures to obtain critical values. Additionally, the tests are consistent and have nontrivial local power, under a sequence of local alternatives. The above theory is developed for the stationary case, as well as for the case of heterogeneity that is induced by distributional change over time. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the tests perform reasonably well in finite samples, and an application in which we examine exchange rate data indicates that our tests can help identify superior forecasting models, regardless of loss function.","[Jin, Sainan] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Corradi, Valentina] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Swanson, Norman R.] Rutgers State, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Singapore Management University; University of Surrey; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Jin, SN (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",snjin@smu.edu.sg,,,Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund [MOE2012-T2-2-021],"Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","We are grateful to the editor, Peter C.

As biosimilars offer the potential for lower acquisition costs versus the originator biologic, evaluating the economic implications of the introduction of biosimilars is of interest. Budget impact analysis (BIA) is a commonly used methodology. This review of published BIAs of biosimilar fusion proteins and/or monoclonal antibodies identified 12 unique publications (three full papers and nine congress posters). When evaluated alongside professional guidance on conducting BIA, the majority of BIAs identified were generally in line with international recommendations. However, a lack of peer-reviewed journal articles and considerable shortcomings in the publications were identified. Deficiencies included a limited range of cost parameters, a reliance on assumptions for parameters such as uptake and drug pricing, a lack of expert validation, and a limited range of sensitivity analyses that were based on arbitrary ranges. The rationale for the methods employed, limitations of the BIA approach, and instructions for local adaptation often were inadequately discussed. To understand fully the potential economic impact and value of biosimilars, the impact of biosimilar supply, manufacturer-provided supporting services, and price competition should be included in BIAs. Alternative approaches, such as cost minimization, which requires evidence demonstrating similarity to the originator biologic, and those that integrate a range of economic assessment methods, are needed to assess the value of biosimilars.","[Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Jacobs, Ira] Pfizer Inc, Global Med Affairs, 235 East 42nd St, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Popovian, Robert] Pfizer Inc, US Govt Relat, Washington, DC USA; [Isakov, Leah] Pfizer Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Shane, Lesley G.] Pfizer Inc, Outcomes & Evidence Global Hlth & Value, New York, NY USA",KU Leuven; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Jacobs, I (通讯作者)，Pfizer Inc, Global Med Affairs, 235 East 42nd St, New York, NY 10017 USA.",ira.jacobs@pfizer.com,,"Shane, Lesley G/0009-0007-3204-5720; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005; Popovian, Robert/0000-0001-6285-5256",Pfizer Inc.,Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer),This study and preparation of this manuscript were funded by Pfizer Inc.,,50,31,33,1,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2017,35.0,10,,,,,1047,1062,,10.1007/s40273-017-0529-x,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FH7AR,28660473.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411333800006,0

Pivotal to their estimation is the existence of sound resource-use measurement (RUM) instruments; however, RUM instruments for ICBs in the education or criminal justice sectors have not yet been systematically collated or their psychometric quality assessed. This review aims to fill this gap. Methods To identify relevant instruments, the Database of Instruments for Resource Use Measurement (DIRUM) was searched. Additionally, a systematic literature review was conducted in seven electronic databases to detect instruments containing ICB items used in economic evaluations. Finally, studies evaluating the psychometric quality of these instruments were searched. Results Twenty-six unique instruments were included. Most frequently, ICB items measured school absenteeism, tutoring, classroom assistance or contacts with legal representatives, police custody/prison detainment and court appearances, with the highest number of items listed in the Client Service Receipt Inventory/Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory/Client Service Receipt Inventory-Children's Version (CSRI/CSSRI/CSRI-C), Studying the Scope of Parental Expenditures (SCOPE) and Self-Harm Intervention, Family Therapy (SHIFT) instruments. ICBs in the education sector were especially relevant for age-related developmental disorders and chronic diseases, while criminal justice resource use seems more important in mental health, including alcohol-related disorders or substance abuse. Evidence on the validity or reliability of ICB items was published for two instruments only. Conclusion With a heterogeneous variety of ICBs found to be relevant for several disease areas but many ICB instruments applied in one study only (21/26 instruments), setting-up an international task force to, for example, develop an internationally adaptable instrument is recommended.","[Mayer, Susanne; Laszewska, Agata; Simon, Judit] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Econ, Kinderspitalgasse 15-1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Mayer, Susanne; Paulus, Aggie T.

The model is a finite mixture of normal distributions with covariate dependent multinomial logit mixing probabilities. A prior for the number of mixture components is specified on positive integers. The marginal distribution of covariates is not modeled. We study asymptotic frequentist behavior of the posterior in this model. Specifically, we show that when the true conditional density has a certain smoothness level, then the posterior contraction rate around the truth is equal up to a log factor to the frequentist minimax rate of estimation. An extension to the case when the covariate space is unbounded is also established. As our result holds without a priori knowledge of the smoothness level of the true density, the established posterior contraction rates are adaptive. Moreover, we show that the rate is not affected by inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model.

Although modeling guidelines recommend using state-of-the-art quality assurance and control methods for software engineering to verify models, the fields of pharmacoeconomics and health technology assessment (HTA) have yet to establish and adopt guidance on how to verify health and economic models. The objective of this paper is to introduce to our field the variety of methods the software engineering field uses to verify that software performs as expected. We identify how many of these methods can be incorporated in the development process of decision-analytic models in order to reduce errors and increase transparency. Given the breadth of methods used in software engineering, we recommend a more in-depth initiative to be undertaken (e.g., by an ISPOR-SMDM Task Force) to define the best practices for model verification in our field and to accelerate adoption. Establishing a general guidance for verifying models will benefit the pharmacoeconomics and HTA communities by increasing accuracy of computer programming, transparency, accessibility, sharing, understandability, and trust of models.","[Dasbach, Erik J.; Elbasha, Elamin H.] Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA; [Dasbach, Erik J.; Elbasha, Elamin H.] Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, Merck Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, UG1C 60,POB 1000, N Wales, PA 19454 USA",Merck & Company; Merck & Company,"Elbasha, EH (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA.;Elbasha, EH (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Merck Res Labs, Merck Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, UG1C 60,POB 1000, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",elamin_elbasha@merck.com,"Dasbach, Erik/AAP-6801-2021","Elbasha, Elamin/0000-0002-9993-8036",,,,,65,11,11,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2017,35.0,7,,,,,673,683,,10.1007/s40273-017-0508-2,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EY0YS,28456972.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403688100002,0

We show that if payoffs are hump-shaped in the quantile, then a sudden rush of players stops in any Nash or subgame perfect equilibrium.Fear relaxes the first mover advantage in pre-emption games, asking that the least quantile beat the average; greed relaxes the last mover advantage in wars of attrition, asking just that the last quantile payoff exceed the average. With greed, play is inefficiently late: an accelerating war of attrition starting at optimal time, followed by a rush. With fear, play is inefficiently early: a slowing pre-emption game, ending at the optimal time, preceded by a rush. The theory predicts the length, duration, and intensity of stopping, and the size and timing of rushes, and offers insights for many common timing games.","[Anderson, Axel] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Smith, Lones] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Park, Andreas] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Management, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",Georgetown University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Anderson, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",aza@georgetown.edu; lones@ssc.wisc.edu; andreas.park@utoronto.ca,"SMITH, LONES/AAF-5793-2020",,,,,,30,5,6,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2017,85.0,3,,,,,871,913,,10.3982/ECTA13089,0.0,,,43,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EX3ER,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403115300006,0

The bargaining games are the ultimatum game (UG) and the yes-or-no game (YNG). Strategic risk in a game stems from the effect on one player's payoff of the behavior of other players. In the UG this risk is high, while it is nearly absent in the YNG. In studying the decision making process of subjects we use the time elapsed before a choice is made (response time) as a proxy for amount of thought or introspection. We find that response times are on average larger in the UG than in the YNG, indicating a positive correlation between strategic risk and introspection. In both games the behavior of subjects with large response times is more dispersed than that of subjects with small response times. In the UG larger response time is associated with less generous and thus riskier behavior, while it is associated with more generous behavior in the YNG.","[Branas-Garza, Pablo] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, Hendon Campus, London NW4 4BT, England; [Meloso, Debrah] Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France; [Miller, Luis] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Sch Business & Econ, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Middlesex University; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; University of Basque Country,"Meloso, D (通讯作者)，Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France.",debrah.meloso@esc-rennes.com,"Branas-Garza, Pablo/AAH-8894-2020; Miller, Luis/N-9669-2019; Brañas-Garza, Pablo/Q-1532-2018","Branas-Garza, Pablo/0000-0001-8456-6009; Miller, Luis/0000-0002-7447-2313; Brañas-Garza, Pablo/0000-0001-8456-6009; Meloso, Debrah/0000-0001-8025-1667","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2012-30626, CSD2010-00034, ECO2013-44879-R]; Government of Andalusia Project for Excellence in Research [P12-SEJ-1436]; Basque Government [IT-783-13]; European Research Council",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Government of Andalusia Project for Excellence in Research; Basque Government(Basque Government); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Grants ECO2012-30626, CSD2010-00034, and ECO2013-44879-R), the Government of Andalusia Project for Excellence in Research (Grant P12-SEJ-1436), Basque Government (research group IT-783-13), and the European Research Council (advanced Grant BRSCDP-TEA).

Randomization tests provide a general means of constructing tests that control size in finite samples whenever the distribution of the observed data exhibits symmetry under the null hypothesis. Here, by exhibits symmetry we mean that the distribution remains invariant under a group of transformations. In this paper, we provide conditions under which the same construction can be used to construct tests that asymptotically control the probability of a false rejection whenever the distribution of the observed data exhibits approximate symmetry in the sense that the limiting distribution of a function of the data exhibits symmetry under the null hypothesis. An important application of this idea is in settings where the data may be grouped into a fixed number of clusters with a large number of observations within each cluster. In such settings, we show that the distribution of the observed data satisfies our approximate symmetry requirement under weak assumptions. In particular, our results allow for the clusters to be heterogeneous and also have dependence not only within each cluster, but also across clusters. This approach enjoys several advantages over other approaches in these settings.","[Canay, Ivan A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Romano, Joseph P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, 390 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shaikh, Azeem M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University; University of Chicago,"Canay, IA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",iacanay@northwestern.edu; romano@stanford.edu; amshaikh@uchicago.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1530534, DMS-1307973, DMS-1308260, SES-1227091, SES-1530661]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1530534] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Chris Hansen, Aprajit Mahajan, Ulrich Mueller, and Chris Taber for helpful comments.

The coalition with the greatest power wins the resource and divides it among its members. The agents' power increases according to their share of the resource.We study two models of coalition formation where winning agents accumulate power and losing agents may participate in further coalition formation processes. An axiomatic approach is provided by focusing on variations of two main axioms: self-enforcement, which requires that no further deviation happens after a coalition has formed, and rationality, which requires that agents pick the coalition that gives them their highest payoff. For these alternative models, we determine the existence of stable coalitions that are self-enforcing and rational for two traditional sharing rules. The models presented in this paper illustrate how power accumulation, the sharing rule, and whether losing agents participate in future coalition formation processes, shape the way coalitions will be stable throughout time.","[Jandoc, Karl; Juarez, Ruben] Univ Hawaii, Dept Econ, 2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Jandoc, Karl; Juarez, Ruben] Univ Hawaii, UHERO, 2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System,"Juarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Dept Econ, 2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Juarez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, UHERO, 2424 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",rubenj@hawaii.edu,"Juarez, Ruben/IUN-3946-2023","Juarez, Ruben/0000-0001-8179-6001; Jandoc, Karl/0000-0003-2111-7585",AFOSR Young Investigator Program,AFOSR Young Investigator Program,"Financial support from the AFOSR Young Investigator Program is greatly appreciated.

We investigate the distributional properties of a number of different schemes for model choice and parameter estimation, including: in-sample model selection using the Akaike information criterion; out-of-sample model selection; and splitting the data into subsamples for model selection and parameter estimation. Using a weak-predictor local asymptotic scheme, we provide a representation result that facilitates comparison of the distributional properties of the procedures and their associated forecast risks. This representation isolates the source of inefficiency in some of these procedures. We develop a simulation procedure that improves the accuracy of the out-of-sample and split-sample methods uniformly over the local parameter space. We also examine how bootstrap aggregation ( bagging) affects the local asymptotic risk of the estimators and their associated forecasts. Numerically, we find that for many values of the local parameter, the out-of-sample and split-sample schemes perform poorly if implemented in the conventional way.

Naloxegol is a peripherally acting A mu-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat patients with inadequate response to laxative(s) (laxative inadequate responder [LIR]). A cost-effectiveness model was constructed from the UK payer perspective to compare oral naloxegol 25 mg with placebo in non-cancer LIR patients receiving opioids for chronic pain, and a scenario analysis of naloxegol 25 mg with rescue laxatives compared with placebo with rescue laxatives in the same patient population. Methods The model comprised a decision tree for the first 4 weeks of treatment, followed by a Markov model with a 4-week cycle length and the following states: 'OIC', 'non-OIC (on treatment)', 'non-OIC (untreated)' and 'death'. Two phase III trials with a follow-up period of 12 weeks provided data on treatment efficacy, transition probabilities, adverse event frequency and patient utility. Resource utilisation data were sourced from a UK-based burden of illness study and physician surveys. A UK National Health Service and Personal Social Service perspective was adopted; costs and health-related quality of life gains were discounted at a rate of 3.5 %. The model was run over a time horizon of 5 years, reflecting the average period of opioid use. Results Naloxegol has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 10,849 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained versus placebo, and A 11,179 pound when rescue laxatives are made available in both arms (2014 values). Model outcomes were only sensitive to variations in utility inputs. However, the probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicate that naloxegol has a 91 % probability of being cost effective at a A 20,000 pound threshold when compared with placebo. Conclusions Naloxegol is likely a cost-effective treatment option for LIR patients with OIC. This assessment should be supported by further work on the utility of patients with OIC, including how utility varies with more granular measures of OIC.","[Lawson, Richard; King, Frederic] AstraZeneca Global Payer & Pricing GPEP, 101 Orchard Ridge Dr, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA; [Ryan, James] AstraZeneca Global Payer & Pricing GPEP, Da Vinci Bldg,Melbourn Sci Pk, Hereford SG8 6EE, Herts, England; [Goh, Jo Wern] Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Tichy, Eszter; Marsh, Kevin] Evidera Inc, Metro Bldg 6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England",Evidera; Evidera,"Marsh, K (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, Metro Bldg 6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England.",Richard.Lawson1@astrazeneca.com; James.Ryan@astrazeneca.com; Frederic.King@astrazeneca.com; jo.goh@evidera.com; eszter.tichy@evidera.com; kevin.marsh@evidera.com,,,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),AstraZeneca provided the funding for the study described in this article and for the production of the article itself.

This assumption is unrealistic in an insurance context, where arbitrary scaling of risks is generally not possible. Here, we model risks as being partially generated by Levy processes, capturing the non-linear aggregation of risk. The model leads to non-homogeneous fuzzy games, for which the Euler rule is not applicable. For such games, we seek capital allocations that are in the core, that is, do not provide incentives for splitting portfolios. We show that the Euler rule of an auxiliary linearised fuzzy game (non-uniquely) satisfies the core property and, thus, provides a plausible and easily implemented capital allocation. In contrast, the Aumann Shapley allocation does not generally belong to the core. For the non-homogeneous fuzzy games studied, Tasche's (1999) criterion of suitability for performance measurement is adapted and it is shown that the proposed allocation method gives appropriate signals for improving the portfolio underwriting profit.

A fundamental issue is the evaluation of the quality of a risk estimation. On the one hand, a backtesting procedure is desirable for assessing the accuracy of such an estimation and this can be naturally achieved by elicitable risk measures. For the same objective, an alternative approach has been introduced by Davis [Stat. Risk Model. Appl. Finance Insurance, 2016, 33, 67-93] through the so-called consistency property. On the other hand, a risk estimation should be less sensitive with respect to small changes in the available data-set and exhibit qualitative robustness. A new risk measure, the Lambda value at risk , has been recently proposed by Frittelli et al. [Math. Finance, 2014, 24, 442-463], as a generalization of VaR with the ability to discriminate the risk among P&L distributions with different tail behaviour.

It is shown that there are substantial power gains from including correlated covariates. The limit distribution of the CADF test, however, depends on the nuisance parameter that represents the correlation between the equation error and the covariates. Hence, inference based directly on the CADF test is not possible. To provide a valid inferential basis for the CADF test, we propose to use the parametric bootstrap procedure to obtain critical values, and establish the asymptotic validity of the bootstrap CADF test. Simulations show that the bootstrap CADF test significantly improves the asymptotic and the finite sample size performances of the CADF test, especially when the covariates are highly correlated with the error. Indeed, the bootstrap CADF test offers drastic power gains over the conventional unit root tests. Our testing procedures are applied to the extended Nelson and Plosser data set.","[Chang, Yoosoon] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Sickles, Robin C.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX USA; [Song, Wonho] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Rice University; Chung Ang University,"Song, W (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",whsong@cau.ac.kr,"Sickles, Robin/IRZ-2742-2023",,National Science Foundation [SES-0453069/0730152],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Chang gratefully acknowledges the financial support by the National Science Foundation through grant number SES-0453069/0730152.,,21,11,17,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Photovoltaic (PV) poverty alleviation is one of the innovative targeted poverty-alleviating modes in China, in which poor household can invest in distributed PV power plant which will be later constructed in the roofs of their houses, and the power supply company will purchase all generated power from farmers at a price of 0.98yuan ($0.14) per kwh. In this way, each poor household can earn an extra income of approximately 3,000yuan ($ 435.60). To study the actual implement of PV poverty alleviation policy, our team went to Yuexi County to carry out field research, visited a total of 5 villages, 33 households. According to the investigation, we can conclude that he five villages are representative and the participants of PV project share features of low income, low educational level and lack of working ability. Based on the current situation, the power generation is very substantial, basically in line with expectations the government estimates. However, there are still many factors, like decline in PV benchmark price, affecting the long-term profits of PV poverty alleviation. While there is also innovation emerged from implement, which will lead to stable output of power generation, but extra cost. The further improvement of the innovation and the whole PV project is worth of discussion.","[Zhang, Yuejie] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhang, YJ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",impapaya@163.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-15-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,61,66,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8CU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427983100013,0

Motivated by recent results showing that the choice of VaR estimator does not crucially influence decision-making in certain practical applications (e.g. in investment rankings), this study analyses the important question of how asset allocation decisions are affected when alternative VaR estimation methodologies are used. Focusing on the most popular, successful and conceptually different conditional VaR estimation techniques (i.e. historical simulation, peak over threshold method and quantile regression) and the flexible portfolio model of Campbell et al. [J. Banking Finance. 2001, 25(9), 1789-1804], we show in an empirical example and in a simulation study that these methods tend to deliver similar asset weights. In other words, optimal portfolio allocations appear to be not very sensitive to the choice of VaR estimator. This finding, which is robust in a variety of distributional environments and pre-whitening settings, supports the notion that, depending on the specific application, simple standard methods (i.e. historical simulation) used by many commercial banks do not necessarily have to be replaced by more complex approaches (based on, e.g. extreme value theory).","[Scheller, Felix; Auer, Benjamin R.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Finance, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Auer, Benjamin R.] CESifo Munich, Res Network Area Macro Money & Int Finance, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Leipzig University; Ifo Institut,"Auer, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Dept Finance, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.;Auer, BR (通讯作者)，CESifo Munich, Res Network Area Macro Money & Int Finance, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",auer@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,Fritz Thyssen Stiftung [20.15.0.079 WW]; Wissenschaftsforderung der Sparkassen Finanzgruppe e.V.,Fritz Thyssen Stiftung; Wissenschaftsforderung der Sparkassen Finanzgruppe e.V.,We are indebted to the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung [grant number 20.15.0.079 WW] and the Wissenschaftsforderung der Sparkassen Finanzgruppe e.V. for generous financial support.,,138,7,7,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

These tests are designed to be asymptotically robust to the order of integration of the series at both the zero and seasonal frequencies. Motivated by the approach of Hylleberg, Engle, Granger and Yoo, we base our approach on linear filters of the data that remove any potential unit roots at the frequencies not associated with the deterministic component(s) under test. Test statistics are constructed using the filtered data such that they have well defined limiting null distributions regardless of whether the data are either integrated or stationary at the frequency associated with the deterministic component(s) under test. In the same manner as Vogelsang, Bunzel and Vogelsang and Sayginsoy and Vogelsang, we scale these statistics by a function of an auxiliary seasonal unit root statistic. This allows us to construct tests that are asymptotically robust to the order of integration of the data at both the zero and seasonal frequencies. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that our proposed tests have good finite sample size and power properties. An empirical application to UK gross domestic product indicates the presence of seasonal mean shifts in the data.","[Astill, S.; Taylor, A. M.

Beyond the context of economic evaluation, evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of health state utility values can be used to inform broader health policy decisions. This paper provides practical guidance on how to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of health state utility values. The paper outlines a number of stages in conducting a systematic review, including identifying the appropriate evidence, study selection, data extraction and presentation, and quality and relevance assessment. The paper outlines three broad approaches that can be used to synthesise multiple estimates of health utilities for a given health state or condition, namely fixed-effect meta-analysis, random-effects meta-analysis and mixed-effects meta-regression. Each approach is illustrated by a synthesis of utility values for a hypothetical decision problem, and software code is provided. The paper highlights a number of methodological issues pertinent to the conduct of meta-analysis or meta-regression. These include the importance of limiting synthesis to 'comparable' utility estimates, for example those derived using common utility measurement approaches and sources of valuation; the effects of reliance on limited or poorly reported published data from primary utility assessment studies; the use of aggregate outcomes within analyses; approaches to generating measures of uncertainty; handling of median utility values; challenges surrounding the disentanglement of utility estimates collected serially within the context of prospective observational studies or prospective randomised trials; challenges surrounding the disentanglement of intervention effects; and approaches to measuring model validity. Areas of methodological debate and avenues for future research are highlighted.","[Petrou, Stavros; Madan, Jason] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Kwon, Joseph] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Warwick; University of Sheffield,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Kwon, Joseph/0000-0002-2860-7280; Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480","MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,69,22,22,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36.0,9,,,,,1043,1061,,10.1007/s40273-018-0670-1,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29750430.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439998500002,0

MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; TOTAL ERROR; CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; OPTIMAL STRATEGIES; CARE; SIMULATION; DISEASE; ASSAY,"Introduction Numerous factors contribute to uncertainty in test measurement procedures, and this uncertainty can have a significant impact on the downstream clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of testing strategies. Currently, however, there is no clear guidance concerning if or how such factors should be considered within Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) of tests. Objective The aim was to provide an introduction to key concepts in measurement uncertainty for the HTA community and to explore, via systematic review, current methods utilised within HTAs. Methods HTAs of in vitro tests including a model-based economic evaluation were identified via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) HTA database and key reimbursement authority websites. Data were extracted to explore the specific components of measurement uncertainty assessed and methods utilised. The findings were narratively synthesised. Results Of 107 identified HTAs, 20 (19%) attempted to assess components of measurement uncertainty: 15 did so via some form of pre-model assessment (such as a literature review or laboratory survey); four also included components within the economic model; and one considered measurement uncertainty within the model only. One study quantified the impact of measurement uncertainty on cost-effectiveness and found that this parameter significantly changed the results, but did not impact the overall decision uncertainty. Conclusion A minority of HTAs identified from this review used various approaches to assess and/or incorporate the impact of measurement uncertainty, indicating that these assessments are feasible. Uncertainty remains around best practice methodology for conducting such analyses; further research is required to ensure that future HTAs are fit for purpose.","[Smith, Alison F.; Hulme, Claire] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Alison F.; Messenger, Mike; Hulme, Claire] NIHR Leeds In Vitro Diagnost Cooperat IVDC, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Messenger, Mike] Univ Leeds, Leeds Ctr Personalised Med & Hlth, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hall, Peter] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Canc Res Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of Edinburgh,"Smith, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Smith, AF (通讯作者)，NIHR Leeds In Vitro Diagnost Cooperat IVDC, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.f.c.smith@leeds.ac.uk,"Hulme, Charles/B-4115-2013","Smith, Alison/0000-0001-7709-1869; Hulme, Claire/0000-0003-2077-0419",NIHR [DRF-2016-09-084]; NIHR; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2016-09-084] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2016-09-084] Funding Source: researchfish,NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"AS is supported by an NIHR Doctoral Fellowship, DRF-2016-09-084.

The new CLTs are used to develop a test of the restrictive separability' condition that is necessary for second-stage regressions of efficiency estimates on environmental variables. We show that if this condition is violated, not only are second-stage regressions difficult to interpret and perhaps meaningless, but also first-stage, unconditional efficiency estimates are misleading. As such, the test developed here is of fundamental importance to applied researchers using non-parametric methods for efficiency estimation.

We propose a family of new procedures called the subcluster wild bootstrap, which includes the ordinary wild bootstrap as a limiting case. In the case of pure treatment models, where all observations within clusters are either treated or not, the latter procedure can work remarkably well. The key requirement is that all cluster sizes, regardless of treatment, should be similar. Unfortunately, the analogue of this requirement is not likely to hold for difference-in-differences regressions.

The pCODR review process considers four dimensions of value-clinical benefit, economic evaluation, patient-based values and adoption feasibility-but they do not define weights for individual decision criteria or an acceptable threshold for any of the criteria. Given this implicit review process, it is of interest to understand which factors appear to carry the most weight in pCODR recommendations using a revealed preferences approach. Methods Using publicly available decision summaries (n = 91) describing submissions and resulting recommendations 2011-2017, we extracted ten attributes that characterized each submission. Using logistic regression, we identified statistically significant attributes and estimated their relative impact in final recommendations. Results Clinical aspects appear to carry the greatest weight in the decision to reject or not reject, along with aspects of patient value (treatments with no alternatives were less likely to be rejected). Cost effectiveness does not appear to play a role in the initial decision to reject or not reject but is critical in full versus conditional approvals. There is evidence of a maximum acceptable threshold of around $Can140,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Conclusion A set of factors driving pCODR recommendations is identifiable, supporting the consistency of the review process. However, the implicit nature of the review process and the difficulty of extracting and interpreting some of the attribute levels used in the analysis suggests that the process may still lack full transparency.","[Skedgel, Chris] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Skedgel, Chris] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Pharm, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Wranik, Dominika] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Wranik, Dominika] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Hu, Min] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada",University of East Anglia; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Skedgel, C (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Skedgel, C (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Sch Pharm, Halifax, NS, Canada.",c.skedgel@uea.ac.uk,"Skedgel, Chris/U-7173-2019","Skedgel, Chris/0000-0003-4989-8846; Wranik, Wieslawa Dominika/0000-0002-7318-3886; Hu, Min/0000-0002-7839-2812","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Health Services and Health Policy Research [PHE-129912]","Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Health Services and Health Policy Research","This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Health Services and Health Policy Research (Grant PHE-129912).",,43,31,34,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36.0,4,,,,,467,475,,10.1007/s40273-018-0610-0,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29353385.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426901000008,0

Since Sarmanov's distribution can join different types of marginals, we also assume that these marginals belong to Panjer's class of distributions and discuss the evaluation of the resulting compound distribution based on recursions. Alternatively, the evaluation of the same distribution using the Fast Fourier Transform method is also presented, with the purpose to significantly reduce the computing time, especially in the dependency case.

Objective The objective of this study was to estimate the expected incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of increased government health expenditure as an empirical estimate of the average opportunity costs of decisions to fund new health technologies. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is proposed as a reference ICER to inform value-based decision making in Australia. Methods Empirical top-down approaches were used to estimate the QALY effects of government health expenditure with respect to reduced mortality and morbidity. Instrumental variable two-stage least-squares regression was used to estimate the elasticity of mortality-related QALY losses to a marginal change in government health expenditure. Regression analysis of longitudinal survey data representative of the general population was used to isolate the effects of increased government health expenditure on morbidity-related, QALY gains. Clinical judgement informed the duration of health-related quality-of-life improvement from the annual increase in government health expenditure. Results The base-case reference ICER was estimated at AUD28,033 per QALY gained. Parametric uncertainty associated with the estimation of mortality- and morbidity-related QALYs generated a 95% confidence interval AUD20,758-37,667. Conclusion Recent public summary documents suggest new technologies with ICERs above AUD40,000 per QALY gained are recommended for public funding. The empirical reference ICER reported in this article suggests more QALYs could be gained if resources were allocated to other forms of health spending.","[Edney, Laura Catherine; Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Karnon, Jonathan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Level 9,Adelaide Hlth & Med Sci Bldg, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Cheng, Terence Chai] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Level 4,10 Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Edney, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Level 9,Adelaide Hlth & Med Sci Bldg, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",laura.edney@adelaide.edu.au,"Cheng, Terence C/IQW-2710-2023","Edney, Laura/0000-0002-2447-4118; Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099; Hajiali Afzali, Hossein/0000-0002-0198-8394",National Health and Medical Research Council Project Grant [108-4387],National Health and Medical Research Council Project Grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),This study was funded by a National Health and Medical Research Council Project Grant (No. 108-4387).,,29,137,139,1,18,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2018,36.0,2,,,,,239,252,,10.1007/s40273-017-0585-2,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FV6LA,29273843.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424691300010,0

Ironically, the fact that the estimators are complicated can make the standard bootstrap computationally burdensome because it requires repeated recalculation of the estimator. In this paper, we propose a method that is specific to extremum estimators based on U-statistics. The contribution here is that rather than repeated recalculation of the U-statistic-based estimator, we can recalculate a related estimator based on single sums. A simulation study suggests that the approach leads to a good approximation to the standard bootstrap and that if this is the goal, then our approach is superior to numerical derivative methods.","[Honore, Bo E.] Dept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hu, Luojia] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Econ Res Dept, 230 S La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Honoré, BE (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",honore@princeton.edu; lhu@frbchi.org,,,National Science Foundation; Gregory C.

Algorithms, 2001, 26, 77-92; The Gibbs Phenomenon in Various Representations and Applications, 2011], to price European-type options in Levy and affine processes. The motivation behind this application is to reduce the inefficiency of current Fourier techniques when they are used to approximate piecewise continuous (non-smooth) probability density functions. When techniques such as fast Fourier transforms and Fourier series are applied to price and hedge options with non-smooth probability density functions, they cause the Gibbs phenomenon; accordingly, the techniques converge slowly for density functions with jumps in value or derivatives. This seriously adversely affects the efficiency and accuracy of these techniques. In this paper, we derive pricing formulae and their option Greeks using the SFP method to resolve the Gibbs phenomenon and restore the global spectral convergence rate. Moreover, we show that our method requires a small number of terms to yield fast error convergence, and it is able to accurately price any European-type option deep in/out of the money and with very long/short maturities. Furthermore, we conduct an error-bound analysis of the SFP method in option pricing. This new method performs favourably in numerical experiments compared with existing techniques.","[Chan, Tat Lung (Ron)] Univ East London, Dept Business, Water Lane, Stratford E15 4LZ, England",,"Chan, TL (通讯作者)，Univ East London, Dept Business, Water Lane, Stratford E15 4LZ, England.",t.l.chan@uel.ac.uk,,"Chan, Tat Lung/0000-0002-4048-6370",,,,,38,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The early default regulation affects the policies' value not only directly via changing the policies' payment stream but also indirectly via influencing policyholder's surrender. In this paper, we endogenize surrender risk by assuming a representative policyholder's surrender intensity bounded from below and from above and uncover the impact of the regulation on the policyholder's surrender decision making. A partial differential equation is derived to characterize the price of a participating policy and solved with the finite difference method. We discuss the impacts of the early default regulation and insurance company's reaction to the regulation in terms of its investment strategy on the policyholder's surrender as well as on the contract value, which depend on the policyholder's rationality level.

However, this evidence has relied on informal tests that may be unable to reliably distinguish multifractal processes from other related classes. The current paper develops a formal statistical testing procedure for determining which class of fractal process is most consistent with the distributional scaling properties in a given sample of data. Our testing methodology consists of a set of test statistics, together with a model-based bootstrap resampling scheme to obtain sample p-values. We demonstrate in Monte Carlo exercises that the proposed testing methodology performs well in a wide range of testing environments relevant for financial applications. Finally, the methodology is applied to study the scaling properties of a data-set of intraday equity index and exchange rate returns. The empirical results suggest that the scaling properties of these return series may be inconsistent with purely multifractal processes.","[Hallam, Mark] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Olmo, Jose] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Essex; University of Southampton,"Hallam, M (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",mark.hallam@essex.ac.uk,"Olmo, Jose/Y-7042-2019","Olmo, Jose/0000-0002-0437-7812",Science Foundation Ireland [08/SRC/FMC1389]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [BIDEB 2216],Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"Mark Hallam would like to thank Science Foundation Ireland (under grant number 08/SRC/FMC1389) and The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (under the BIDEB 2216 Research Fellowship Programme for International Researchers, undertaken at Koc University) for financial support.",,43,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We first explicitly give the default boundaries and the values of a deposit, straight bond, WD bond, equity and bank asset, and then use a numerical example to demonstrate the relations among leverage, deposits, WD bonds and bank value. Our results show that value-maximizing banks select the ratio of deposit, straight bond and WD debt so that endogenous default is consistent with exogenous bank closure. The bank increases its leverage by swapping both deposits and straight bonds for WD bonds. And the issuance of WD bonds not only reduces the expected bankruptcy loss and credit spread of straight bonds, but also improves the bank value. This indicates that WD bonds do help to stabilize banks. We also study the role of deposit insurance and the Chinese Financial Stability Bureau (FSB), and give a closed-form expression for the fair insurance premium. Lastly, to check the robustness of our results, we do the sensitivity analysis and investigate the effect of three sets of exogenous parameters on bank capital structure: WD parameters, bank business features, closure rules and insurance subsidy, and obtain some practically significant implications.","[Li, Ping; Meng, Hui] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Li, Ping] Beihang Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Complex Syst Anal Management & Decis, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Yu, Feihui] Peking Univ, Sch Software & Microelect, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Beihang University; Peking University,"Li, P (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Li, P (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Complex Syst Anal Management & Decis, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",liping124@buaa.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271015, 71571008]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71271015], [grant number 71571008].",,22,7,7,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Stochastic models, such as Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992), are a popular choice to deal with longevity risk. However, these mortality models often have unsatisfactory results for the case of small populations. Thus, quite a few modifications (such as approximation and maximal likelihood estimation) to the Lee Carter can be used for the case of small populations or missing observations. In this study, we propose an alternative approach (graduation methods) to improve the performance of stochastic models. The proposed approach is a combination of data aggregation and mortality graduation. In specific, we first combine the historical data of target population, treating it as the reference population, and use the data graduation methods (Whittaker and partial standard mortality ratio) to stabilize the mortality estimates of the target population. We first evaluate whether the proposed method have smaller errors in mortality estimation than the Lee-Carter model in the case of small populations, and explore if it is possible to reduce the bias of parameter estimates in the Lee-Carter model.

Decision analytic models in healthcare depict the typical clinical pathway of patients in general clinical practice and frequently include health states defined to represent comorbidities such as sequelae or adverse events. Health state utility values (HSUVs) are often not available for these and analysts generally estimate them. This article provides a summary of the methodological literature on estimating methods frequently used together with worked examples. The three main methods used (minimum, multiplicative and additive) can produce a wide range in the values estimated. In general, the minimum method overestimates observed HSUVs and the magnitude of error tends to increase as the observed values decrease. Conversely, the additive and multiplicative methods generally underestimate observed values and the magnitude of the errors is generally greater for the additive method. HSUVs estimated using the multiplicative method tend to decrease for lower HSUVs and the largest errors are in observed HSUVs >0.6. Differences in estimated values can produce substantial differences in the resulting incremental cost effectiveness ratio. Based on the current evidence, the multiplicative method is advocated but additional research is required to determine appropriate methods when estimating values for additional comorbidities.","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Ara, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,9,11,12,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S89,S94,,10.1007/s40273-017-0551-z,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052158.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400011,0

Specifically, we consider a continuous-time variation of the classic StAahl-Rubinstein bargaining model, in which there is a finite deadline that ends the negotiations, and in which each player's opportunity to make proposals is governed by a player-specific Poisson process, in that the rejecter of a proposal becomes proposer at the first next arrival of her process. Under the assumption that future payoffs are not discounted, it is shown that the expected payoffs players realize in subgame perfect equilibrium converge to the continuous Raiffa solution outcome as the deadline tends to infinity. The weights reflecting the asymmetries among the players correspond to the Poisson arrival rates of their respective proposal processes.","[Driesen, Bram] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Eccles, Peter] British Airways Plc, Harmondsworth UB7 0GB, England; [Wegner, Nora] Bank England, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA, England",University of Glasgow; Bank of England,"Driesen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",driesen.bram@gmail.com; eccles.peter@gmail.com; norawegner@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Building on Manski and Tamer (2002, Econometrica 70(2), 519-546) who study nonparametric bounds for mean regression with interval data, we characterize the identified set of weighted average derivatives of regression functions. Since the weighted average derivatives do not rely on parametric specifications for the regression functions, the identified set is well-defined without any functional-form assumptions. Under general conditions, the identified set is compact and convex and hence admits characterization by its support function. Using this characterization, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound of the support function when the outcome variable is interval-valued. Using mean regression as an example, we further demonstrate that the support function can be estimated in a regular manner by a computationally simple estimator and that the efficiency bound can be achieved.","[Kaido, Hiroaki] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Kaido, H (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",hkaido@bu.edu,,"Kaido, Hiroaki/0000-0003-2849-915X","NSF [SES-1230071, SES-1357643]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author thanks the editor and anonymous referees for comments that helped improve this paper.

Recently, a new method has been proposed-the discretely integrated condition event or DICE simulation-that enables frequently employed approaches to be specified using a common, simple structure that can be entirely contained and executed within widely available spreadsheet software. To assess if a DICE simulation provides equivalent results to an existing discrete event simulation, a comparison was undertaken. A model of osteoporosis and its management programmed entirely in Visual Basic for Applications and made public by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit was downloaded and used to guide construction of its DICE version in Microsoft Excel(A (R)). The DICE model was then run using the same inputs and settings, and the results were compared. The DICE version produced results that are nearly identical to the original ones, with differences that would not affect the decision direction of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (< 1% discrepancy), despite the stochastic nature of the models. The main limitation of the simple DICE version is its slow execution speed. DICE simulation did not alter the results and, thus, should provide a valid way to design and implement decision-analytic models without requiring specialized software or custom programming. Additional efforts need to be made to speed up execution.","[Moller, Jorgen] Evidera, Modeling & Simulat, 1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England; [Davis, Sarah; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Caro, J.

It explores under what circumstances individual participants exercise the option to exit such a scheme if participation is voluntary. We begin by showing how the willingness to participate increases if the period over which the option is valid becomes longer. Then, we demonstrate how the pension fund's set of policy instruments can be deployed to minimize the likelihood that any cohort exits the pension scheme. The instruments consist of contribution and indexation policies. Recovery of the funding ratio, i.e. the ratio of assets over liabilities, to its regulatory target level may be based on uniform contributions or age-dependent contributions. Specifically, while the value of the exit option deters younger workers from exiting the pension fund, a uniform contribution policy encourages older workers to stay in the pension scheme.

However, informal care is not a free resource. Our objective was to assess the impact of alternative valuation methods and key assumptions on the cost of informal care. Informal carers who assisted in the care of a head and neck cancer survivor for at least 1 year were sent a postal questionnaire during January-June 2014 requesting information on time spent on caring tasks in the month prior to the survey. Time was costed using the opportunity cost approach (OCA; base-case) and the generalist (GRCA) and specialist (SRCA) replacement cost approaches. The impact on results of how household work and informal carers not in paid employment are treated were investigated. We estimated a cost of a,notsign20,613 annually in the base case (OCA - mean wage) for informal care. The GRCA and SRCA equivalent costs were 36% (a,notsign13,196) and 31% (a,notsign14,196) lower, respectively. In the extreme scenario of applying a 'zero' opportunity cost to carers not in paid employment, costs fell by 67% below the base case. While the choice of costing method is important for monetary valuation, the sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the underlying population can be equally so. This is especially important given the heterogeneous treatment of older carers, female carers and carers not in paid employment in the OCA. To limit this, we would suggest using the SRCA to value informal care across heterogeneous carer populations.","[Hanly, Paul; Maguire, Rebecca] Natl Coll Ireland, Mayor St, Dublin 1, Ireland; [Balfe, Myles; O'Sullivan, Eleanor] Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland; [Sharp, Linda] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",National College of Ireland; University College Cork; Newcastle University - UK,"Hanly, P (通讯作者)，Natl Coll Ireland, Mayor St, Dublin 1, Ireland.",paul.hanly@ncirl.ie; rebecca.maguire@ncirl.ie; m.balfe@ucc.ie; Eleanor.osullivan@ucc.ie; linda.sharp@ncl.ac.uk,,"Maguire, Rebecca/0000-0002-0368-4626; O'Sullivan, Eleanor/0000-0003-4982-9488; Hanly, Paul/0000-0002-5348-4825","Irish Health Research Board [HRA/2009/262, HRA/ 2009/262/R]; Health Research Board (HRB) [HRA-2009-262] Funding Source: Health Research Board (HRB)",Irish Health Research Board(Health Research Board - Ireland); Health Research Board (HRB)(Health Research Board - Ireland),Funding for the collection of the data used in this study was supplied by the Irish Health Research Board (HRA/2009/262; HRA/ 2009/262/R).,,30,3,3,1,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2017,35.0,5,,,,,591,601,,10.1007/s40273-017-0490-8,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER9SS,28205149.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399167600008,0

Sellers are endowed with one unit of the good and compete by posting prices in every period. Buyers each demand one unit of the good and have a common reservation price. They have full information regarding the prices posted by each firm in the market; hence, search is costless. The number of buyers coming to the market in each period is random. Demand uncertainty is said to be high if there are at least two non-zero demand states that give a seller different option values of waiting to sell. Our model features a unique symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium in which price dispersion prevails if and only if the degree of demand uncertainty is high.

A proxy W need only satisfy an exclusion restriction and that the treatment and outcome are mean independent from W given Z. Unlike Z, W need not satisfy monotonicity and may, under particular specifications, fail exogeneity. For example, W could code Z with error, with missing observations, or coarsely. We show that Wald, LIV, and IV estimands using W identify weighted averages of local or marginal treatment effects (LATEs or MTEs). We study a necessary and sufficient condition for nonnegative weights. Further, we study a condition under which the Wald or LIV estimand using W identifies the same LATE or MTE that would have been recovered had Z been observed. For example, this holds for binary Z and therefore the Wald estimand using W identifies the same average causal response, or LATE for binary treatment, that would have been recovered using Z. Also, under this condition, LIV using W can be used to identify MTE and average treatment effects for e.g., the population, treated, and untreated.","[Chalak, Karim] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA",University of Virginia,"Chalak, K (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",chalak@virginia.edu,,"Chalak, Karim/0000-0002-6875-172X",,,,,42,8,8,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We construct a model of the underlying asset price process which is dynamically consistent to the power law. The volatility process of the model is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter less than half. The fractional Brownian motion is correlated with a Brownian motion which drives the asset price process. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the implied volatility as the time to maturity tends to zero. For this purpose, we introduce a new approach to validate such an expansion, which enables us to treat more general models than in the literature. The local-stochastic volatility model is treated as well under an essentially minimal regularity condition in order to show such a standard model cannot be dynamically consistent to the power law.","[Fukasawa, Masaaki] Osaka Univ, Dept Math, 1-1 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukasawa, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Dept Math, 1-1 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan.",fukasawa@math.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24684006]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24684006, 25245046] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under KAKENHI [grant number 24684006].,,34,51,54,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this context, numerous papers considered threshold (refractive) and barrier (reflective) dividend strategies. These were shown to be optimal in a number of different contexts for bounded and unbounded payout rates, respectively. In this paper, motivated by the behavior of some dividend paying stock exchange companies, we determine the optimal dividend strategy when both continuous (refractive) and lump sum (reflective) dividends can be paid at any time, and if they are subject to different transaction rates. We consider the general family of spectrally positive Levy processes. Using scale functions, we obtain explicit formulas for the expected present value of dividends until ruin, with a penalty at ruin. We develop a verification lemma, and show that a two-layer (a, b) strategy is optimal. Such a strategy pays continuous dividends when the surplus exceeds level a > 0, and all of the excess over b > a as lump sum dividend payments. Results are illustrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Prices are determined by zero-profit conditions, and the set of traded contracts is determined by free entry. Crucially for applications, contract characteristics are endogenously determined, consumers may have multiple dimensions of private information, and an equilibrium always exists. Equilibrium corresponds to the limit of a differentiated products Bertrand game. We apply the model to establish theoretical results on the equilibrium effects of mandates. Mandates can increase efficiency but have unintended consequences. With adverse selection, an insurance mandate reduces the price of low-coverage policies, which necessarily has indirect effects such as increasing adverse selection on the intensive margin and causing some consumers to purchase less coverage.","[Azevedo, Eduardo M.] Univ Penn Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,Steinberg Dietrich Hall 1455, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Azevedo, Eduardo M.] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Gottlieb, Daniel] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, Campus Box 1133,One Brook Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Microsoft; Washington University (WUSTL),"Azevedo, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,Steinberg Dietrich Hall 1455, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Azevedo, EM (通讯作者)，Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",eazevedo@wharton.upenn.edu; dgottlieb@wustl.edu,,"Azevedo, Eduardo/0000-0001-6048-6506",Wharton School Dean's Research Fund; Dorinda and Mark Winkelman Distinguished Scholar Award,Wharton School Dean's Research Fund; Dorinda and Mark Winkelman Distinguished Scholar Award,"We would like to thank Alberto Bisin, Yeon-Koo Che, Pierre-Andre Chiappori, Alex Citanna, Vitor Farinha Luz, Matt Gentzkow, Piero Gottardi, Nathan Hendren, Bengt Holmstrom, Jonathan Kolstad, Lucas Maestri, Humberto Moreira, Roger Myerson, Maria Polyakova, Kent Smetters, Phil Reny, Casey Rothschild, Florian Scheuer, Bernard Salanie, Johannes Spinnewijn, Andre Veiga, Glen Weyl, and seminar participants at the University of Chicago, Columbia, EUI, EESP, EPGE, Harvard CRCS/Microsoft Research AGT Workshop, Oxford, MIT, NBER's Insurance Meeting, the University of Pennsylvania, SAET, UCL, the University of Toronto, and Washington University in St. Louis for helpful discussions and suggestions.

When panel data sets are available, it is well-known that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is point-identified under the DID setup. If a panel data set is not available, repeated cross sections (pretreatment and posttreatment) may be used, but may not point-identify the ATT. This paper systematically studies the identification of the ATT under the DID setup when posttreatment treatment status is unknown for the pretreatment sample. This is done through a novel application of an extension of a continuous version of the classical monotone rearrangement inequality which allows for general copula bounds. The identifying power of an instrumental variable and of a matched subsample' is also explored. Finally, we illustrate our approach by estimating the effect of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 on employment outcomes of the disabled.","[Fan, Yanqin] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Manzanares, Carlos A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Vanderbilt University,"Fan, YQ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",fany88@u.washington.edu,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We define the constrained numeraire property through the notion of expected relative return and prove that drawdown-constrained numeraire portfolio exists and is unique, but may depend on the investment horizon. However, when sampled at the times of its maximum and asymptotically as the time-horizon becomes distant, the drawdown-constrained numeraire portfolio is given explicitly through a model-independent transformation of the unconstrained numeraire portfolio. The asymptotically growth-optimal strategy is obtained as limit of numeraire strategies on finite horizons.","[Kardaras, Constantinos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Obloj, Jan] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Platen, Eckhard] Univ Technol, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; University of Technology Sydney,"Kardaras, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, 10 Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.kardaras@lse.ac.uk,"Obloj, Jan K/A-4750-2013","Obloj, Jan K/0000-0002-5686-5498; Platen, Eckhard/0000-0003-4595-3123","University of Technology, Sydney","University of Technology, Sydney","The second author gratefully acknowledges the support of the 2011 Bruti-Liberati Fellowship at University of Technology, Sydney.

We derive asymptotic results for the new algorithms that justify certain established approaches to forecast combination including trimming, clustering, weighting, and shrinkage. We also show that when implemented on unbalanced panels, different combination algorithms implicitly impute missing data differently, so that the performance of the resulting combined forecasts are not comparable. After explicitly imputing the missing observations in the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) over 1968 IV-2013 I, we find that the equally weighted average continues to be hard to beat, but the new algorithms can potentially deliver superior performance at shorter horizons, especially during periods of volatility clustering and structural breaks.","[Lahiri, Kajal; Peng, Huaming] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Zhao, Yongchen] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, Towson, MD USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Peng, HM (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",hpeng@albany.edu,,,,,,,39,10,10,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We study in detail the common procedure which estimates the pricing kernel as the ratio of two separate density estimations. In the first step, we analyse theoretically the functional dependence for the ratio of a density to its estimated density; this cautions the reader regarding potential computational issues coupled with statistical techniques. In the second step, we study this quantitatively; we show that small sample biases shape the estimated pricing kernel, and that estimated pricing kernels typically violate the commonly believed monotonicity at the centre even when the true pricing kernel fulfils these. This contributes to an alternative, statistical explanation for the puzzling shape in pricing kernel estimations.","[Leisen, Dietmar P.

Theoretical models of price discrimination and Ramsey pricing support differentials based inversely on price elasticities, which are plausibly related to average per capita income. However, these models do not address absolute price levels and dynamic efficiency. Value-based differential pricing theory incorporates insurance coverage and addresses static and dynamic efficiency. Limited empirical evidence indicates a weak positive relationship between prices and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. External referencing and parallel trade undermine differential pricing. We discuss previously neglected factors that undermine differential pricing in practice. High price growth relative to GDP in the USA leads to widening differentials between the USA and other countries. Concerns over the effects of confidential rebating challenges acceptance of this approach to implementing price differentials. The growth of branded generics in low- and middle-income countries leads to complex markets with product and price differentiation.","[Danzon, Patricia M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management Dept, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Danzon, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management Dept, 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",danzon@wharton.upenn.edu,,"Danzon, Patricia/0000-0002-7236-5194",,,,,47,24,28,3,27,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12,,,,,1395,1405,,10.1007/s40273-018-0696-4,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30062518.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451183300001,0

A widely used estimator is the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using the L-1,L-1 matrix norm on the precision matrix Omega. The L-1,L-1 norm is a LASSO penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in Omega. We propose a new estimator called structured GLASSO (SGLASSO) that uses the L-1,L-2 mixed norm. The use of the L-1,L-2 penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in Omega. We show that when the network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes. Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the structure of the graphical model. In an empirical illustration using a classic firms' investment data set, we obtain a network of firms' dependence that exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric and US Steel forming the core group of firms.","[Chiong, Khai Xiang] Univ Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Univ Pk Campus, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Moon, Hyungsik Roger] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Southern California; Yonsei University,"Chiong, KX (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",khai.chiong@utdallas.edu; moonr@usc.edu,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01023679],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We thank Victor Chernozhukov and two referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Numerical case studies demonstrate the impact of the network topology and indicate that higher order approximations are indispensable for the analysis of non-linear claims.","[Fahrenwaldt, Matthias A.] Heriot Watt Univ, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Dept Actuarial Math & Stat, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Weber, Stefan; Weske, Kerstin] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Math Stochast, Welfengarten 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University; Leibniz University Hannover,"Weber, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Math Stochast, Welfengarten 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",m.fahrenwaldt@hw.ac.uk; sweber@stochastik.uni-hannover.de; weske@stochastik.uni-hannover.de,,"Weber, Stefan/0000-0001-7770-5672; Awiszus, Kerstin/0000-0003-1932-6185",,,,,35,33,32,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2018,48.0,3,,,,,1175,1218,,10.1017/asb.2018.23,0.0,,,44,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GV7RN,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446328300010,0

Pricing in these markets leads to incomplete tax pass-through and agents re optimize their purchase and pricing decisions in response to any tax change. We use detailed data from Pennsylvania, a state that monopolizes retail sales of alcoholic beverages, to estimate a model of demand for horizontally differentiated products that ties consumers' demographic characteristics to heterogeneous preferences for spirits. We find that under the state's current tax policy, spirits are overpriced. Distillers respond to decreases in the tax rate by increasing wholesale prices, which limits the state's revenue gain to only 13% of the incremental tax revenue predicted under the common assumption of perfect competition. The strategic response of noncompetitive firms to changes in taxation therefore flattens the Laffer curve significantly.","[Miravete, Eugenio J.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Competit Policy, Dept Econ, UEA, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Miravete, Eugenio J.] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Seim, Katja] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, CEPR, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Seim, Katja] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Thurk, Jeff] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Pennsylvania; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Notre Dame,"Miravete, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Competit Policy, Dept Econ, UEA, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Miravete, EJ (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",miravete@eco.utexas.edu; kseim@wharton.upenn.edu; jthurk@nd.edu,"Thurk, Jeff/AAB-6009-2021; Thurk, Jeff/AAB-6530-2022","Thurk, Jeff/0000-0002-7626-7524",,,,,46,37,43,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2018,86.0,5,,,,,1651,1687,,10.3982/ECTA12307,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HB2AT,,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450837000005,0

Methods The Markov model incorporated the lifetime horizon, synthesis-based estimates of biologics' efficacy in relation to anti-TNF exposure, and administration of biologics reflecting clinical practice (e.g., sequence of biologics, retreatment, 12-month treatment). The utilities, non-medical costs and indirect costs were derived from a study of 200 adult patients with CD, while the healthcare costs were from a study of 1393 adults with CD who used biologics in Poland. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (the societal perspective) were discounted with the annual rates of 3.5 and 5%, respectively. Results The addition of vedolizumab (ustekinumab) to the sequence of available anti-TNFs (after first-line infliximab or after second-line adalimumab) led to a gain of 0.364 0.349) QALYs at an additional cost of (sic)5600.24 ((sic)6593.82). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were (sic)15,369 [ 95% confidence interval (CI) 7496-61,354] and (sic)18,878 (95% CI 9213-85,045) per QALY gained with vedolizumab and ustekinumab, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed a high impact on the ICERs of the relapse rate after discontinuation of biologic treatment. The highest value of vedolizumab/ustekinumab was estimated after the failure of therapies with both anti-TNFs. Conclusions CD treatment with ustekinumab or vedolizumab after failure of anti-TNF therapy appears to be costeffective at a threshold of (sic) 31,500. The replacement of the second-line anti-TNF with ustekinumab/vedolizumab and the course of the disease after discontinuation of biologics are influential drivers of the cost-effectiveness.","[Holko, Przemyslaw; Kawalec, Pawel; Pilc, Andrzej] Jagiellonian Univ, Coll Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Drug Management Dept,Inst Publ Hlth, Grzegorzecka 20, PL-31531 Krakow, Poland; [Pilc, Andrzej] Polish Acad Sci, Dept Neurobiol, Smetna 12, PL-31343 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University; Collegium Medicum Jagiellonian University; Polish Academy of Sciences,"Holko, P (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Coll Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Drug Management Dept,Inst Publ Hlth, Grzegorzecka 20, PL-31531 Krakow, Poland.",p.holko@peresc.com; pawel.kawalec@uj.edu.pl; andrzej.pilc@uj.edu.pl,"Holko, Przemysław/H-5720-2011; Pilc, Andrzej/A-3948-2008","Holko, Przemysław/0000-0002-6821-4078; Pilc, Andrzej/0000-0002-4045-0597",,,,,40,9,9,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2018,36.0,7,,,,,853,865,,10.1007/s40273-018-0653-2,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GJ5BX,29667146.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435397300010,0

Our goal is to assess the effectiveness of the VIX-linked fee structure in decreasing the sensitivity of the insurer's liability to volatility risk. Since the GMWB payoff is highly path-dependent, it is particularly sensitive to volatility risk, and can also be challenging to price, especially in the presence of the VIX-linked fee. In this paper, following Kouritzin, 2018, we present an explicit weak solution for the value of the VA account and use it in Monte Carlo simulations to value the GMWB guarantee.

As special cases, this family nests many distributions with light and heavy tails, including the lognormal, gamma, Weibull, Burr and generalised gamma distributions. This paper extends the GB2 family to the contaminated GB2 family, which offersmany flexible features, including bimodality and a wide range of skewness and kurtosis. Properties of the contaminated distribution are derived and evaluated in a simulation study and the suitability of the contaminated GB2 distribution for actuarial purposes is demonstrated through two real loss data sets. Analysis of tail quantiles for the data suggests large differences in extreme quantile estimates for different loss distribution assumptions, showing that the selection of appropriate distributions has a significant impact for insurance companies.","[Chan, J.

Recent endeavours to estimate the empirical value of the thresholds, both from the supply side and the demand side, are then presented. The impact on CE thresholds of future directions for the field, such as thresholds across sectors and the incorporation of multiple criteria beyond quality-adjusted life-years as a measure of 'value', are highlighted.

A growing literature has analysed past decisions by committees (revealed preference, RP studies) and hypothetical decisions by committee members (stated preference, SP studies) to identify factors influencing decisions and assess their importance. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to provide insight into committee preferences for these factors (after controlling for other factors) and the methods used to elicit them. Ovid Medline, Embase, Econlit and Web of Science were searched from inception to 11 May 2017. Included studies had to have investigated factors considered by HTA committees and to have conducted multivariate analysis to identify the effect of each factor on funding decisions. Factors were classified as being important based on statistical significance, and their impact on decisions was compared using marginal effects. Twenty-three RP and four SP studies (containing 42 analyses) of 14 HTA committees met the inclusion criteria. Although factors were defined differently, the SP literature generally found clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and equity factors (such as disease severity) were each important to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. These findings were supported by the RP studies of the PBAC, but not the other committees, which found funding decisions by these and other committees were mostly influenced by the acceptance of the clinical evidence and, where applicable, cost-effectiveness. Trust in the evidence was very important for decision makers, equivalent to reducing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year) by A$38,000 (Australian dollars) for the PBAC and A 15,000 pound for NICE. This review found trust in the clinical evidence and, where applicable, cost-effectiveness were important for decision makers. Many methodological differences likely contributed to the diversity in some of the other findings across studies of the same committee. Further work is needed to better understand how competing factors are valued by different HTA committees.","[Ghijben, Peter; Lancsar, Emily; Zavarsek, Silva] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Gu, Yuanyuan] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Zavarsek, Silva] Deakin Univ, Ctr Populat Hlth Res, Deakin Hlth Econ, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia",Monash University; Macquarie University; Deakin University,"Ghijben, P (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",peter.ghijben@monash.edu,,"Gu, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-3816-9106; Lancsar, Emily/0000-0003-2404-6735; Ghijben, Peter/0000-0002-7532-7847",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [APP1047788],National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),The research was supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grant (APP1047788): Societal and decision maker preferences for priority setting in health care resource allocation.,,61,18,18,1,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,323,340,,10.1007/s40273-017-0586-1,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29124632.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800006,0

A recent Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that intramuscular interferon beta 1a (IFN-beta-1a-IM) was inferior to the other beta interferons (IFN-beta s) for multiple sclerosis (MS). As a result, CONITEC commissioned an analysis to review possible disinvestment within SUS. The objective of this paper is to describe the disinvestment process for IFN-beta-1a-IM in Brazil. The first assessment comprised a literature review and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. The outcome of interest was the proportion of relapse-free patients in 2 years. This analysis confirmed the inferiority of IFN-beta-1a-IM. Following this, CONITEC recommended disinvestment, with the decision sent for public consultation. More than 3000 contributions were made on CONITEC's webpage, most of them against the preliminary decision. As a result, CONITEC commissioned a study to assess the effectiveness of IFN-beta-1a-IM among Brazilian patients in routine clinical care. The second assessment involved an 11-year follow-up of a non-concurrent cohort of 12,154 MS patients developed by deterministic-probabilistic linkage of SUS administrative databases. The real-world assessment further demonstrated that IFN-beta-1a-IM users had a statistically higher risk of treatment failure, defined as treatment switching or relapse treatment or death, with the assessment showing that IFN-beta-1a-IM was inferior to the other IFN-beta s and to glatiramer acetate in both direct and indirect analysis. In the drug ranking with 40,000 simulations, IFN-beta-1a-IM was the worst option, with a success rate of only 152/40,000. Following this, CONITEC decided to exclude the intramuscular presentation of IFN-beta from the current MS treatment guidelines, giving patients who are currently on this treatment the option of continuing until treatment failure. In conclusion, we believe this is the first example of this new disinvestment process in action, providing an exemplar for other treatments in Brazil as well as other countries.","[Pires de Lemos, Livia Lovato; Guerra Junior, Augusto Afonso; Diniz, Isabela; Pereira, Ramon Goncalves; Alvares, Juliana; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Farm, SUS Collaborating Ctr Technol Assessment & Excell, Sala 1042,Ave Presidente Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Pires de Lemos, Livia Lovato; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Med, Programa Posgrad Saude Publ, Sala 533,Ave Porf Alfredo Balena 190,Campus Saude, BR-30130100 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Guerra Junior, Augusto Afonso; Diniz, Isabela; Alvares, Juliana; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Farm, Programa Posgrad Medicamentos & Assistencia Farma, Sala 1023,Ave Presidente Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Santos, Marisa; Magliano, Carlos] Inst Nacl Cardiol, Nucleo Avaliacao Tecnol Saude, R Laranjeiras 374, BR-22240006 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Souza, Kathiaja; Zimmermann, Ivan Ricardo; Canuto dos Santos, Vania Crisitna; Pretramale, Clarice Alegre] Minist Saude, Dept Gestao & Inc Tecnol Saude, Secretaria Ciencia Tecnol & Insumos Estrateg, Esplanada Minist Bloco G, BR-70058900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Souza, Kathiaja] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Programa Posgrad Saude Baseada Evidencias, Rua Botucatu 740,3 Andar, BR-04023900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Inst, Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Div Clin Pharmacol, S-14186 Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian; Bennie, Marion] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland; [Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Ctr Hlth Econ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; University of Strathclyde; University of Liverpool,"Godman, B (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Div Clin Pharmacol, S-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.;Godman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, 161 Cathedral St, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland.;Godman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Ctr Hlth Econ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",lilolemos@gmail.com; augustoguerramg@gmail.com; marisaccih@gmail.com; carlosincnats@gmail.com; beladiz@gmail.com; kathiajamsouza@gmail.com; ramonbhb@gmail.com; jualvares@gmail.com; Brian.Godman@ki.se; marion.bennie@strath.ac.uk; ivanzricardo@gmail.com; vania.canuto@saude.gov.br; clarice.petramale@saude.gov.br; fracurcio@gmail.com,"da Silva Santos, Marisa/ABA-3418-2020; Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019; Guerra, Augusto Afonso/AAS-6584-2020; Pereira, Ramon/ISS-5980-2023; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana/AAY-8801-2020; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis/G-2583-2012","da Silva Santos, Marisa/0000-0002-2174-6800; Guerra, Augusto Afonso/0000-0001-5256-0577; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana/0000-0002-0210-0721; Souza, Kathiaja/0000-0002-9054-4794; Bennie, Marion/0000-0002-4046-629X; magliano, carlos/0000-0003-0210-4877; Lemos, Livia/0000-0002-8921-515X; Pereira, Ramon/0000-0001-7874-3398; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis/0000-0002-5880-5261","Ministry of Health of Brazil [TED 78/2015, BR/LOA 1500033.001]; MRC [MR/K007017/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) [AMS-NAF1-GuerraJunior] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MR/K007017/1, HDR-5001] Funding Source: researchfish",Ministry of Health of Brazil; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)(Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),CCATES-UFMG received support from the Ministry of Health of Brazil through resource transfer from the National Health Fund (TED 78/2015).

This result, which, although undoubtedly correct, has been regarded by many as surprising, stems from the implicit assumption that the long-term discount function has an exponential tail. We revisit the problem in the setting of modern interest rate theory, and show that if the long simple interest rate (or Libor rate) is finite, then this rate (unlike the zero-coupon rate) acts viably as a state variable, the value of which can fluctuate randomly in line with other economic indicators. New interest rate models are constructed, under this hypothesis and certain generalizations thereof, that illustrate explicitly the good asymptotic behavior of the resulting discount bond systems. The conditions necessary for the existence of such hyperbolic and generalized hyperbolic long rates are those of so-called social discounting, which allow for long-term cash flows to be treated as broadly just as important as those of the short or medium term. As a consequence, we are able to provide a consistent arbitrage-free valuation framework for the cost-benefit analysis and risk management of long-term social projects, such as those associated with sustainable energy, resource conservation, and climate change.","Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge, Middx, England; St Petersburg Natl Res Univ Informat Technol Mech, St Petersburg, Russia",Brunel University; ITMO University,"Brody, DC (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Dept Math, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",dorje.brody@brunel.ac.uk,"Hughston, Lane P/N-8590-2013; Brody, Dorje/F-1591-2010","Hughston, Lane/0000-0003-1185-934X; Brody, Dorje/0000-0002-9242-9554",,,,,64,9,10,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

However, budget impact analyses remain less frequently conducted and less well researched than cost-effectiveness analyses. The objective of this study was to fill the gap in research on budget impact analyses by assessing (1) the quality of stand-alone budget impact analyses, and (2) the feasibility of extending cost-effectiveness analyses to capture budget impact. We developed a budget impact analysis checklist and scoring system for budget impact analyses, which we then adapted for cost-effectiveness analyses, based on current International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force recommendations. We applied both budget impact analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis checklists and scoring systems to examine the extent to which existing economic evaluations provide sufficient evidence about budget impact to enable decision making. We used rotavirus vaccination as an illustrative case in which low- and middle-income countries uptake has been limited despite demonstrated cost effectiveness. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccine in low- and middle-income countries published between January 2000 and February 2017. We critically appraised the quality of budget impact analyses, and assessed the extension of cost-effectiveness analyses to provide useful budget impact information. Six budget impact analyses and 60 cost-effectiveness analyses were identified. Budget impact analyses adhered to most International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research recommendations, with key exceptions being provision of undiscounted financial streams for each budget period and model validation. Most cost-effectiveness analyses could not be extended to provide useful budget impact information; cost-effectiveness analyses also rarely presented undiscounted annual costs, or estimated financial streams during the first years of programme scale-up. Cost-effectiveness analyses vastly outnumber budget impact analyses of rotavirus vaccination, despite both being critical for policy decision making. Straightforward changes to the presentation of cost-effectiveness analyses results could facilitate their adaptation into budget impact analyses.","[Carvalho, Natalie] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Dis Grp, Ctr Hlth Policy & Global Burden, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jit, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Jit, Mark] Publ Hlth England, Modelling & Econ Unit, London, England; [Cox, Sarah] WHO, Program Appl Vaccine Experiences Scholar, Initiat Vaccine Res, Geneva, Switzerland; [Yoong, Joanne] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Yoong, Joanne] Natl Univ Hosp Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Hutubessy, Raymond C.

In the context of continuous time Markov chains (CTMC) several deterministic and statistical algorithms have been proposed to estimate the generator matrix. We focus on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by Bladt and Sorensen. [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B (Stat. Method.), 2005, 67, 395-410] for a CTMC with an absorbing state for such estimation. This work's contribution is threefold. Firstly, we provide directly computable closed form expressions for quantities appearing in the EM algorithm and associated information matrix, allowing easy approximation of confidence intervals. Previously, these quantities had to be estimated numerically and considerable computational speedups have been gained. Secondly, we prove convergence to a single set of parameters under very weak conditions (for the TPM problem). Finally, we provide a numerical benchmark of our results against other known algorithms, in particular, on several problems related to credit risk. The EM algorithm we propose, padded with the new formulas (and error criteria), outperforms other known algorithms in several metrics, in particular, with much less overestimation of probabilities of default in higher ratings than other statistical algorithms.","[dos Reis, G.; Smith, G.] Univ Edinburgh, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Sch Math, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [dos Reis, G.] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, CMA, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"dos Reis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Sch Math, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.;dos Reis, G (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, CMA, Lisbon, Portugal.",G.dosReis@ed.ac.uk,"dos Reis, Goncalo/E-6163-2012","dos Reis, Goncalo/0000-0002-4993-2672",Maxwell Institute Graduate School in Analysis and its Applications; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L016508/01]; Scottish Funding Council; Heriot-Watt University; University of Edinburgh; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) [UID/MAT/00297/2013]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [1502321] Funding Source: researchfish,Maxwell Institute Graduate School in Analysis and its Applications; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Scottish Funding Council; Heriot-Watt University; University of Edinburgh; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"G.

We use a unified notational approach to describe these estimators and discuss their properties in terms of deviations from an underlying set of basic assumptions. Furthermore, we consider the extendability of these estimators to practical situations that may frequently arise, such as their ability to accommodate unbalanced panels and common observed factors. Using a large-scale simulation exercise, we consider scenarios that remain largely unexplored in the literature, albeit being of great empirical relevance. In particular, we examine (i) the effect of the presence of weakly exogenous covariates, (ii) the effect of changing the magnitude of the correlation between the factor loadings of the dependent variable and those of the covariates, (iii) the impact of the number of moment conditions on bias and size for GMM estimators, and finally (iv) the effect of sample size. We apply each of these estimators to a crime application using a panel data set of local government authorities in New South Wales, Australia; we find that the results bear substantially different policy implications relative to those potentially derived from standard dynamic panel GMM estimators.

Although the concept of Granger-causality is defined in terms of the conditional distribution, most articles have tested Granger-causality using conditional mean regression models in which the causal relations are linear. Rather than focusing on a single part of the conditional distribution, we develop a test that evaluates nonlinear causalities and possible causal relations in all conditional quantiles, which provides a sufficient condition for Granger-causality when all quantiles are considered. The proposed test statistic has correct asymptotic size, is consistent against fixed alternatives, and has power against Pitman deviations from the null hypothesis. As the proposed test statistic is asymptotically nonpivotal, we tabulate critical values via a subsampling approach. We present Monte Carlo evidence and an application considering the causal relation between the gold price, the USD/GBP exchange rate, and the oil price.","[Troster, Victor] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Cra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Troster, V (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Cra Valldemossa Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",victor.troster@uib.es,"TROSTER, VICTOR/K-5928-2019","TROSTER, VICTOR/0000-0002-8798-5601",Spain's Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2014-58991-C3-3-R],Spain's Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government),I gratefully acknowledge Spain's Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia ECO2014-58991-C3-3-R for financial support.,,35,167,167,8,62,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

VaR forecast estimation involves the conditional evaluation of quantiles based on the currently available information. Recent advances in VaR evaluation incorporate conditional variance into the quantile estimation, yielding the Conditional Autoregressive VaR (CAViaR) models. However, the large number of alternative CAViaR models raises the issue of identifying the optimal quantile predictor. To resolve this uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian encompassing test that evaluates various CAViaR models predictions against a combined CAViaR model based on the encompassing principle. This test provides a basis for forecasting combined conditional VaR estimates when there are evidences against the encompassing principle. We illustrate this test using simulated and financial daily return data series. The results demonstrate that there are evidences for using combined conditional VaR estimates when forecasting quantile risk.","[Tsiotas, Georgios] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Greece",University of Crete,"Tsiotas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Greece.",tsiotas@uoc.gr,,,E.L.K.E. research council [3548],E.L.K.E. research council,The author acknowledges financial support from E.L.K.E. research council [grant number 3548].,,34,5,5,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Employing the change of measure technique, we decompose the pure endowment into the product of the bond price and survival probability, thereby facilitating the evaluation of the annuity expression. With the aid of the dynamics of interest and mortality processes under the forward measure, we construct an algorithm based on comonotonicity theory to estimate the quantiles of survival probability and annuity rate. The comonotonic upper and lower bounds in the convex order are used to approximate the annuity and GAO prices and henceforth avoiding the simulation-within-simulation problem. Numerical illustrations show that our algorithm gives an efficient and practical method to estimate GAO values. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In many of these problems, players are organized according to either a hierarchical structure or a levels structure that restrict the players' possibilities to cooperate. In this paper, we propose three new solutions for games with hierarchical structure and characterize them by properties that relate a player's payoff to the payoffs of other players located in specific positions in the hierarchical structure relative to that player. To define each solution, we consider a certain mapping that transforms the hierarchical structure into a levels structure, and then we apply the standard generalization of the Shapley value to the class of games with levels structure. Such transformation mappings are studied by means of properties that relate a player's position in both types of structure.","[Alvarez-Mozos, M.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Matemat Econ Financera & Actuarial, Barcelona, Spain; [van den Brink, R.; van der Laan, G.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van den Brink, R.; van der Laan, G.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tejada, O.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Barcelona; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tejada, O (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",toriol@ethz.ch,"Alvarez-Mozos, Mikel/B-4610-2016","Alvarez-Mozos, Mikel/0000-0002-8457-4647; Tejada, Oriol/0000-0002-4819-0259; van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [MTM2014-53395-C3-2-P, ECO2014-52340-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014-SGR-40]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),Mikel Alvarez-Mozos and Oriol Tejada acknowledge the financial support of Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad through Projects MTM2014-53395-C3-2-P and ECO2014-52340-P as well as from Generalitat de Catalunya through project 2014-SGR-40.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company's submission for CZP was based predominantly on six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of CZP against placebo. The clinical effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of CZP against the comparators within the scope; therefore, the company performed a network meta-analysis (NMA). The company's NMA concluded that CZP had a similar efficacy to that of its comparators. The company submitted a Markov model that assessed the incremental cost effectiveness of CZP versus comparator biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for the treatment of RA from the perspective of the National Health Service for three decision problems, each of which followed an inadequate response to a TNFi. These were (1) a comparison against rituximab (RTX) in combination with methotrexate (MTX); (2) a comparison against bDMARDs when RTX was contraindicated or withdrawn due to an adverse event; and (3) a comparison against bDMARDs when MTX was contraindicated or withdrawn due to an adverse event. Results from the company's economic evaluation showed that CZP resulted in a similar number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) produced at similar or lower costs compared with comparator bDMARDs. The commercial-in-confidence patient access schemes for abatacept and tocilizumab could not be incorporated by the company, but were incorporated by the ERG in a confidential appendix for the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC). The company estimated that the addition of CZP before RTX in a sequence for patients who could receive MTX produced more QALYs at an increased cost, with a cost per QALY of A 33,222 pound. Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses that did not change the conclusions reached based on the company's economic evaluation in relation to the comparison with bDMARDs. The ERG estimated that where CZP replaced RTX, CZP was dominated, as it produced fewer QALYs at an increased cost. The AC concluded that there was little difference in effectiveness between CZP and comparator bDMARDs and that equivalence among bDMARDs could be accepted. The AC consequently recommended CZP plus MTX for people for whom RTX is contraindicated or not tolerated and CZP monotherapy for people for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated. The AC concluded that CZP plus MTX could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources when RTX plus MTX is a treatment option.","[Bermejo, Inigo; Stevenson, Matt; Archer, Rachel; Stevens, John W.; Goka, Edward; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Scott, David L.] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Young, Adam] West Hertfordshire Hosp NHS Trust, Dept Rheumatol, Watford, Herts, England",University of Sheffield; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,"Bermejo, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",i.bermejo@sheffield.ac.uk,"Goka, Edward/AAA-3865-2022; Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088;",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/06/07],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 15/06/07).

In this problem, the insured has to consider the so-called optimal action rather than the contracted compensation (or indemnity) due to the existence of the bonus. For any pre-agreed bonus, the optimal insurance contract is given explicitly and shown to be either the full coverage contract when the insured pays high enough premium, or a deductible one otherwise. The optimal contract and bonus are also derived explicitly if the insured is allowed to choose both of them. The contract turns out to be of either zero reward or zero deductible. In all cases, the optimal contracts are universal, that is, they do not depend on the specific form of the utility of the insured.

In these circumstances, formal methods to elicit expert judgements are preferred to improve the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process, help reduce bias and the use of heuristics, and also provide a structure that allows uncertainty to be expressed. Expert elicitation is the process of transforming the subjective and implicit knowledge of experts into their quantifiable expressions. The use of expert elicitation in HTA is gaining momentum, and there is particular interest in its application to diagnostics, medical devices and complex interventions such as in public health or social care. Compared with the gathering of experimental evidence, elicitation constitutes a reasonably low-cost source of evidence. Given its inherent subject nature, the potential biases in elicited evidence cannot be ignored and, due to its infancy in HTA, there is little guidance to the analyst wishing to conduct a formal elicitation exercise. This article attempts to summarise the stages of designing and conducting an expert elicitation, drawing on key literature and examples, most of which are not in HTA. In addition, we critique their applicability to HTA, given its distinguishing features. There are a number of issues that the analyst should be mindful of, in particular the need to appropriately characterise the uncertainty associated with model inputs and the fact that there are often numerous parameters required, not all of which can be defined using the same quantities. This increases the need for the elicitation task to be as straightforward as possible for the expert to complete.","[Bojke, Laura; Jankovic, Dina; Soares, Marta] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Grigore, Bogdan; Peters, Jaime; Stein, Ken] Univ Exeter, Peninsula Technol Assessment Grp, Exeter, Devon, England",University of York - UK; University of Exeter,"Bojke, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England.",laura.bojke@york.ac.uk,"Soares, Marta/HJH-3434-2023","Jankovic, Dina/0000-0002-9311-1409; Soares, Marta Ferreira Oliveira/0000-0003-1579-8513; Grigore, Bogdan/0000-0003-4241-7595",Medical Research Council [MR/N028511/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/N028511/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/N028511/1] Funding Source: Medline,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,60,20,22,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2017,35.0,9,,,,,867,877,,10.1007/s40273-017-0525-1,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FE1ZR,28616775.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408016600002,0

The introduction of new treatments (BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immunotherapy) has improved overall survival and progression-free survival of some patients. Objective The objective of this study was to review the published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for advanced melanoma. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, without date or language restrictions, in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence databases and the Health Technology Assessment journal. Internet searches were also made to identify possible grey literature. Main study characteristics, methods and outcomes were extracted and critically assessed. The quality of health economic studies was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Economic Evaluation in Health Care checklist. Results The search identified nine full-text pharmacoeconomic analyses of advanced melanoma treatments. According to the economic analyses published in the articles, the new treatments have been shown to be more effective (with more life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) than chemotherapy, although generally the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was above the commonly accepted threshold. Because of the variability of the available analyses comparing the new treatments, we cannot determine which treatment is the most cost-effective. Conclusions From the available data, it cannot be concluded that the new drugs (BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immunotherapy) are cost effective compared with chemotherapy or which is the most cost-effective new treatment.","[Rubio-Rodriguez, Dario; Rubio-Terres, Carlos] Hlth Value, C Virgen de Aranzazu,21,5 B, Madrid 28034, Spain; [De Diego Blanco, Silvia] Astellas Pharma SA, Market Access Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Perez, Maite] AstraZeneca Farmaceut Spain, Med Dept, Barcelona, Spain",Astellas Pharmaceuticals; AstraZeneca,"Rubio-Terrés, C (通讯作者)，Hlth Value, C Virgen de Aranzazu,21,5 B, Madrid 28034, Spain.",,,,,,,,97,12,15,1,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2017,35.0,9,,,,,879,893,,10.1007/s40273-017-0517-1,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FE1ZR,28551858.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408016600003,0

The distribution function of the present value of future losses at a given valuation time is derived. For illustrative purposes, an AR(1) process is used to model the stochastic rates of return, and the future lifetimes of a couple are assumed to follow a copula model. The effects of the mortality dependence, the portfolio size and the policy type, as well as the impact of investment strategies on the riskiness of portfolios of survivorship life insurance policies are analyzed by means of moments and probability distributions.

Semi-Markov processes have been identified as an adequate tool to study this risk. Nevertheless, access to data is limited and the associated literature still scarce. Insurers mainly use discrete time methods directly inspired from the study of mortality in order to build experience tables. Those methods however are not perfectly suited for the study of competing risk situations. This article provides a theoretical framework to estimate biometric laws associated with a LTC insurance portfolio. The presented method relies on a continuous-time semi-Markov model with three states: autonomy, disability and death. The process describing the state of disability is defined through its transition intensities. We provide a formula to infer the mortality of autonomous people from the mortality of the whole portfolio, on which we have more reliable knowledge. We then propose a parametric expression for the remaining intensities of the model. In particular, incidence in LTC is described by a logistic formula. Under the assumption that the disabled population is a mixture of two latent populations with respect to the category of pathology that caused LTC, we show that the resulting intensity of mortality in LTC takes a very peculiar form and depends on time spent in the LTC state. Estimation of parameters relies on the maximum likelihood method. Our parametric approach, while inducing model uncertainty, eliminates issues related to segmentation in age categories, smoothing or extrapolation at higher ages and thus proves very convenient for the practitioner. Finally, we provide an application using data from a real LTC insurance portfolio.","[Biessy, Guillaume] SCOR Global Life SE, 5 Ave Kleber, F-75795 Paris 16, France; [Biessy, Guillaume] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, UMR CNRS 8071, USC INRA, Lab Math & Modelisat Evry, Evry, France",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Biessy, G (通讯作者)，SCOR Global Life SE, 5 Ave Kleber, F-75795 Paris 16, France.;Biessy, G (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val dEssonne, UMR CNRS 8071, USC INRA, Lab Math & Modelisat Evry, Evry, France.",gbiessy@scor.com,,"Biessy, Guillaume/0000-0003-3756-7345",,,,,27,12,12,1,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2017,47.0,2,,,,,527,561,,10.1017/asb.2016.41,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EU6ML,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401148000007,0

We find that Pareto optimal risk redistributions and the competitive equilibria can be obtained via bargaining with a hypothetical representative agent of expected utility maximizers and a hypothetical representative agent of dual utility maximizers. The representative agent of expected utility maximizers resembles an average risk-averse agent, whereas representative agent of dual utility maximizers resembles an agent that has lowest aversion to mean-preserving spreads. This bargaining leads to an allocation of the aggregate risk to both groups of agents. The optimal contract for the expected utility maximizers is proportional to their allocated risk, and the optimal contract for the dual utility maximizing agents is given by tranching of their allocated risk. We show a method to derive equilibrium prices. We identify a condition under which prices are locally independent of the expected utility functions, and given in closed form. Moreover, we characterize uniqueness of the competitive equilibrium.","[Boonen, Tim J.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Boonen, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.j.boonen@uva.nl,"Boonen, Tim/AAJ-7757-2020","Boonen, Tim/0000-0001-9186-416X",,,,,40,4,4,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2017,47.0,2,,,,,391,415,,10.1017/asb.2017.5,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EU6ML,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401148000002,0

Naturally, the usefulness of a model is determined by the accuracy of its predictions. A previous version of ECHO-T2DM was validated against actual trial outcomes and the model predictions were generally accurate. However, there have been recent upgrades to the model, which modify model predictions and necessitate an update of the validation exercises. Objectives The objectives of this study were to extend the methods available for evaluating model validity, to conduct a formal model validation of ECHO-T2DM (version 2.3.0) in accordance with the principles espoused by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM), and secondarily to evaluate the relative accuracy of four sets of macrovascular risk equations included in ECHO-T2DM. Methods We followed the ISPOR/SMDM guidelines on model validation, evaluating face validity, verification, cross-validation, and external validation. Model verification involved 297 'stress tests', in which specific model inputs were modified systematically to ascertain correct model implementation. Cross-validation consisted of a comparison between ECHO-T2DM predictions and those of the seminal National Institutes of Health model. In external validation, study characteristics were entered into ECHO-T2DM to replicate the clinical results of 12 studies (including 17 patient populations), and model predictions were compared to observed values using established statistical techniques as well as measures of average prediction error, separately for the four sets of macrovascular risk equations supported in ECHO-T2DM. Sub-group analyses were conducted for dependent vs. independent outcomes and for microvascular vs. macrovascular vs. mortality endpoints. Results All stress tests were passed. ECHO-T2DM replicated the National Institutes of Health cost-effectiveness application with numerically similar results. In external validation of ECHO-T2DM, model predictions agreed well with observed clinical outcomes. For all sets of macrovascular risk equations, the results were close to the intercept and slope coefficients corresponding to a perfect match, resulting in high R (2) and failure to reject concordance using an F test. The results were similar for sub-groups of dependent and independent validation, with some degree of under-prediction of macrovascular events. Conclusion ECHO-T2DM continues to match health outcomes in clinical trials in T2DM, with prediction accuracy similar to other leading models of T2DM.","[Willis, Michael; Johansen, Pierre; Nilsson, Andreas; Asseburg, Christian] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Box 2127, SE-22002 Lund, Sweden",,"Willis, M (通讯作者)，Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Box 2127, SE-22002 Lund, Sweden.",michael.willis@ihe.se,"Asseburg, Christian/AAK-2903-2020","Asseburg, Christian/0000-0001-7196-3363; Johansen, Pierre/0000-0002-6287-7508; Willis, Michael/0000-0002-6565-7025; Nilsson, Andreas/0000-0002-4604-7766","Janssen Global Services, LLC.","Janssen Global Services, LLC.","Janssen Global Services, LLC.

There are a number of limitations with this approach, most notably the ability to base patient outcomes on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in both eyes, which may be overcome using a different modelling structure. Simulation modelling allows for this to be modelled more precisely, and therefore may provide more accurate and relevant estimates of the cost effectiveness of ophthalmology interventions. Objective This study aimed to explore the appropriateness of simulation modelling in ophthalmology, using the disease area of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) as an example. Methods A de novo economic model was built using a patient-level simulation, which compared ranibizumab with aflibercept in wAMD. Disease progression was measured using BCVA. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was estimated using a regression analysis linking BCVA in each eye to utility. The analysis was from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK. Five different regression models were explored and were based on BCVA in either one eye or both eyes. Results The model outputs provide some evidence to support the hypothesis that the analyses using the two-eye models for estimating HRQoL generate a more accurate estimation of incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the positive treatment effect for ranibizumab versus aflibercept. Second-order analysis broadly supported these findings, and showed that the variation in incremental costs was slightly lower than in incremental QALYs. The second-order analysis estimated similar incremental costs and a greater overall variation in incremental QALYs than the first-order analysis, suggesting important non-linearities within the model. Conclusions This analysis suggests that patient-level simulation models may be well suited to representing the real-world patient pathway in wAMD, particularly when aspects of disease progression cannot be adequately captured using a Markov structure. The benefits of a simulation approach can be demonstrated in the modelling of HRQoL as a function of BCVA in both eyes.","[Claxton, Lindsay; Hodgson, Robert; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Malcolm, Bill; Jacob, Ruth Pulikottil] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley Business Pk, Surrey, England",University of York - UK; Novartis,"Claxton, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York, N Yorkshire, England.",lindsay.claxton@york.ac.uk,"Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023","Pulikottil-Jacob, Ruth/0000-0003-0630-960X; Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),"The original regression analysis of the Czoski-Murray quality of life dataset was undertaken by David Trueman and Tim Reason at Abacus International, and was funded by Novartis.",,35,14,14,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2017,35.0,2,,,,,237,248,,10.1007/s40273-016-0459-z,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EJ3LU,27787744.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393114500009,0

Directional change (DC) is an alternative approach to record price movements. Instead of sampling at fixed intervals, DC is data driven: price changes dictate when a price is recorded. DC provides us with a complementary way to extract information from data. It allows us to observe features that may not be recognized in time series. The argument is that time series and DC-based analysis complement each other. With data sampled at irregular time intervals in DC, however, some of the time series indicators cannot be used in DC-based analysis. For example, returns must be time adjusted and volatility must be amended accordingly. A major objective of this paper is to introduce indicators for profiling markets under DC. We analyse empirical high-frequency data on major equities traded on the UK stock market, and through DC profiling extract information complementary to features observed through time series profiling.","[Tsang, Edward P.

Then, we compared the results of the two questionnaires and analysed the data obtained, which revealed that after watching the video, audience managed to learn more about not only the characters of the mangrove swamp, but also its importance to ecological environment, and hence they developed a greater concern toward mangrove swamp, becoming more willing to actively protect the environment.

A Bayesian approach to default rate estimation is proposed and illustrated using prior distributions assessed from an experienced industry expert. Two extensions of the binomial model are proposed. The first allows correlated defaults yet remains consistent with Basel II's asymptotic single-factor model. The second adds temporal correlation in default rates through autocorrelation in the systemic factor. Implications for the predictability of default rates are considered. The single-factor model generates more forecast uncertainty than does the parameter uncertainty. A robustness exercise illustrates that the correlation indicated by the data is much smaller than that specified in the Basel II regulations.,"[Kiefer, Nicholas M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, 490 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kiefer, Nicholas M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, 490 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Kiefer, NM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, 490 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Kiefer, NM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, 490 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",nicholas.kiefer@cornell.edu,,,"Danish Science Foundation; University of Aarhus, Denmark","Danish Science Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); University of Aarhus, Denmark","CREATES, funded by the Danish Science Foundation, University of Aarhus, Denmark.",,19,1,1,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

However, these models typically neglect interaction terms between the lagged daily directional movements. We propose a decision tree forecasting model that has the flexibility to capture arbitrary interaction patterns. To study the importance of interaction terms, we construct a binary Markov process with a deterministic component that cannot be predicted without interaction terms between the lagged directional movements. We show that some tree based strategies achieve trading performance significant at the 99% confidence level on the S&P 500 over the past 20 years, after adjusting for multiple testing. The best strategy breaks even with the buy-and-hold strategy at 21 bps in transaction costs per round trip. A four-factor regression analysis shows significant intercept, and correlation with the market. The directional predictability is strongest during the bursts of the dotcom bubble, financial crisis, and European debt crisis. The return sign predictability during these periods confirms the necessity of interaction terms to model daily returns.","[Fievet, L.; Sornette, D.] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Entrepreneurial Risks, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, D.] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Fiévet, L (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Entrepreneurial Risks, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",lfievet@ethz.ch,,,ETH Zurich [0-20029-14],ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich),This work was supported by ETH Zurich [grant number 0-20029-14].,,52,9,10,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In recognition of the extensive use by practitioners of large correlation matrices for the estimation of diversification benefits in capital modelling, we develop a methodology for the construction of such correlation structures (to any dimension). Indeed, the literature does not document any methodology by which practitioners, who often parameterise those correlations by means of informed guesswork, may do so in a disciplined and parsimonious manner. We construct a broad and flexible family of models, where dependency is induced by common shock components. Models incorporate dependencies between observations both within arrays and between arrays. Arrays are of general shape (possibly with holes), but include the usual cases of claim triangles and trapezia that appear in the literature. General forms of dependency are considered with cell-, row-, column-, diagonal-wise, and other forms of dependency as special cases. Substantial effort is applied to practical interpretation of such matrices generated by the models constructed here. Reasonably realistic examples are examined, in which an expression is obtained for the general entry in the correlation matrix in terms of a limited set of parameters, each of which has a straightforward intuitive meaning to the practitioner. This will maximise chance of obtaining a reliable matrix. This construction is illustrated by a numerical example.","[Avanzi, Benjamin; Taylor, Greg; Wong, Bernard] UNSW Sydney, UNSW Sydney Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Avanzi, Benjamin] Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada",University of New South Wales Sydney; Universite de Montreal,"Taylor, G (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, UNSW Sydney Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",b.avanzi@unsw.edu.au; greg.taylor@unsw.edu.au; bernard.wong@unsw.edu.au,"Avanzi, Benjamin/C-3888-2008","Avanzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-5424-4292",Australian Actuaries Institute; Australian Research Council [LP130100723]; Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd.; Insurance Australia Group Ltd.; SuncorpMetway Ltd.; Australian Research Council [LP130100723] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Actuaries Institute; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd.; Insurance Australia Group Ltd.; SuncorpMetway Ltd.; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported by a grant from the Australian Actuaries Institute, as well as under Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme (Project no.

We develop a micro-foundation for these off-path beliefs, and an associated equilibrium refinement, in a model where equilibrium arises through non-equilibrium learning by populations of patient and long-lived senders and receivers. In our model, young senders are uncertain about the prevailing distribution of play, so they rationally send out-of-equilibrium signals as experiments to learn about the behavior of the population of receivers. Differences in the payoff functions of the types of senders generate different incentives for these experiments. Using the Gittins index (Gittins (1979)), we characterize which sender types use each signal more often, leading to a constraint on the receiver's off-path beliefs based on type compatibility and hence a learning-based equilibrium selection.","[Fudenberg, Drew] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [He, Kevin] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Fudenberg, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",drew.fudenberg@gmail.com; hesichao@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1643517],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material was previously part of a larger paper titled Type-Compatible Equilibria in Signalling Games.

In this work, we introduce a 3-parameter compound model to account for all these peculiarities. As conditional distribution, we consider a 2-parameter unimodal hump-shaped distribution with positive support, parameterized with respect to the mode and to another variability related parameter. The compound is performed by scaling the latter parameter by a convenient mixing distribution taking values on all or part of the positive real line and depending on a single parameter governing the tail behavior of the resulting compound distribution. Although any 2-parameter distribution can be considered to derive its compound version in our framework, for illustrative purposes we consider the unimodal gamma, the lognormal, and the inverse Gaussian. They are also used as mixing distributions: this guarantees that the un-compound distribution is nested in the compound model. A family of nine models arises by combining these choices. These models are applied on three famous insurance loss datasets and compared with several standard distributions used in the actuarial literature. Comparison is made in terms of goodness-of-fit and through an analysis of the commonly used risk measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Interest lies in estimating the intensity conditional on the covariates. The impact of the covariates is modelled by an additive model where each component can be written as a linear combination of possibly unknown functions. The focus is on prediction as opposed to variable screening. Conditions are imposed on the coefficients of this linear combination in order to control the estimation error. The rates of convergence are optimal when the number of active covariates is large.

The Child Health Utility Index-9 Dimension (CHU-9D), however, is a preference-based instrument that has been primarily developed to support cost-utility analysis. Objective This paper presents a method for estimating CHU-9D index scores from responses to the PedsQL (TM) using data from a randomised controlled trial of prednisolone therapy for treatment of childhood corticosteroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Methods HRQoL data were collected from children at randomisation, week 16, and months 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48. Observations on children aged 5 years and older were pooled across all data collection timepoints and were then randomised into an estimation (n = 279) and validation (n = 284) sample. A number of models were developed using the estimation data before internal validation. The best model was chosen using multi-stage selection criteria. Results Most of the models developed accurately predicted the CHU-9D mean index score. The best performing model was a generalised linear model (mean absolute error = 0.0408; mean square error = 0.0035). The proportion of index scores deviating from the observed scores by < 0.03 was 53%. Conclusions The mapping algorithm provides an empirical tool for estimating CHU-9D index scores and for conducting cost-utility analyses within clinical studies that have only collected PedsQL (TM) data. It is valid for children aged 5 years or older. Caution should be exercised when using this with children younger than 5 years, older adolescents (> 13 years) or patient groups with particularly poor quality of life.","[Lambe, Tosin; Frew, Emma] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Webb, Nicholas J.

We find evidence consistent with strategic behavior in Cambridge. Such strategizing can complicate preference analysis. This paper develops empirical methods for studying random utility models in a new and large class of school choice mechanisms. We show that preferences are nonparametrically identified under either sufficient variation in choice environments or a preference shifter. We then develop a tractable estimation procedure and apply it to Cambridge. Estimates suggest that while 83% of students are assigned to their stated first choice, only 72% are assigned to their true first choice because students avoid ranking competitive schools. Assuming that students behave optimally, the Immediate Acceptance mechanism is preferred by the average student to the Deferred Acceptance mechanism by an equivalent of 0.08 miles. The estimated difference is smaller if beliefs are biased, and reversed if students report preferences truthfully.","[Agarwal, Nikhil] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Agarwal, Nikhil; Somaini, Paulo] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Somaini, Paulo] Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University,"Agarwal, N (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Agarwal, N (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",agarwaln@mit.edu; soma@stanford.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1427231]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1427231] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful to Parag Pathak for sharing data on admissions in Cambridge Public Schools and for several helpful discussions.

In this paper, we propose an optimal false discovery rate controlling method that is especially useful for such one-sided testing problems. The proposed procedure is optimal in the sense of minimizing the false non-discovery rate while controlling the false discovery rate at a pre-specified level; it uses a deconvolution method based on non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation, which allows for a broader class of treatment effect distributions than existing methods do. The proposed test demonstrates good small-sample performance in Monte Carlo simulations and it is applied to study the effect of attending a more selective high school in Romania. The application reveals strong evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity, in that students who marginally gain access to higher-ranked schools are more likely to benefit if the higher-ranked school has a relatively high admission score cut-off - or, in other words, is more selective.","[Gu, Jiaying] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Shen, Shu] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Toronto; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Gu, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",jiaying.gu@utoronto.ca; shushen@ucdavis.edu,,,Connaught Fund; German Research Foundation [SFB 823],Connaught Fund(University of Toronto); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors would like to thank Roger Koenker, Stanislav Volgushev and seminar participants at the Midwest Econometrics Group Meeting 2014, the University of Alberta, and the Simon Fraser University for helpful comments.

However, the statistical properties of the (quasi-)maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the EGARCH(p, q) parameters are not available under general conditions, but only for special cases under highly restrictive and unverifiable sufficient conditions, such as EGARCH(1,0) or EGARCH(1,1), and possibly only under simulation. A limitation in the development of asymptotic properties of the QMLE for the EGARCH(p, q) model is the lack of an invertibility condition for the returns shocks underlying the model. It is shown in this article that the EGARCH(p, q) model can be derived from a stochastic process, for which sufficient invertibility conditions can be stated simply and explicitly when the parameters respect a simple condition.(1)(1)Using the notation introduced in part 2, this refers to the cases where or -. The first inequality is generally assumed in the literature related to the invertibility of EGARCH. This article provides (in the Appendix) an argument for the possible lack of invertibility when these conditions are not met.

The average difference in measured adherence rates between the two measures was 9.2% (range -66.3 to 61.5). A majority (62.7%) of articles reported moderate (n = 12; 27.9%), high (n = 5, 11.6%), or significant (n = 10, 23.3%) correlations between SRQs and monitoring devices. Results from our review are consistent with previous studies, as we found that many of our studies produced moderate to high correlation between both SRQs and monitoring devices [Farmer, Clin Ther 21(6):1074-90 (1999), IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. Avoidable costs in US health care (2012), Patel et al., Respirology 18(3):546-52 (2013), Siracusa et al., J Cyst Fibros 14(5):621-6 (2015), Smith et al., Int J Cardiol 145(1):122-3 (2010)]. Our findings demonstrate that self-reported adherence produces comparable results to electronic monitoring devices. As there is not yet a 'gold standard' measure for monitoring patient adherence, SRQs and Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) operating together continue to emerge as the preferred effective method for measuring medication adherence.","[Monnette, Alisha; Zhang, Yichen; Shao, Hui; Shi, Lizheng] Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University,"Shi, LZ (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth Management & Policy, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",amonnett@tulane.edu; yzhang23@tulane.edu; hshao@tulane.edu; lshi1@tulane.edu,,,,,,,59,46,50,0,17,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2018,36.0,1,,,,,17,27,,10.1007/s40273-017-0570-9,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FT3HN,28895104.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423038300004,0

In dynamic contracting and policy settings, the method often replaces an endogenous state space of forward-looking utilities with an exogenously given state space of costates.

They are the recommended starting point early within a research and development programme, and before development of phase III trial protocols. While clinical trials can provide an opportunity to collect the required evidence, their appropriateness should be reviewed against the requirements of the model structure taking into account population characteristics, time horizon and frequency of clinical events. Alternative sources such as observational studies or registries may be more appropriate when evidence describing changes in HSUVs over time or rare clinical events is required. Phase IV clinical studies may provide the opportunity to collect additional longitudinal real-world evidence. Aspects to consider when designing the collection of the evidence include patient and investigator burden, whom to ask, the representativeness of the population, the exact definitions of health states within the economic model, the timing of data collection, sample size, and mode of administration. Missing data can be an issue, particularly in longitudinal studies, and it is important to determine whether the missing data will bias inferences from analyses. For example, respondents may fail to complete follow-up questionnaires because of a relapse or the severity of their condition. The decision on the preferred study type and the particular quality of life measure should be informed by any evidence currently available in the literature, the design of data collection, and the exact requirements of the model that will be used to support resource allocation decisions (e.g. reimbursement).","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John; Young, Tracey] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Brazier, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",j.e.brazier@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd),This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,40,4,4,2,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S67,S75,,10.1007/s40273-017-0549-6,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052159.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400009,0

In particular, we focus on pricing VA with Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) that promises to return the entire initial investment through withdrawals and the remaining account balance at maturity. Under the optimal (dynamic) withdrawal strategy of a policyholder, GMWB pricing becomes an optimal stochastic control problem that can be solved using backward recursion Bellman equation. Optimal decision becomes a function of not only the underlying asset but also interest rate. Presently our method is applied to the Vasicek interest rate model, but it is applicable to any model when transition density of the underlying asset and interest rate is known in closed-form or can be evaluated efficiently. Using bond price as a numeraire the required expectations in the backward recursion are reduced to two-dimensional integrals calculated through a high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a two-dimensional cubic spline interpolation. The quadrature is applied after a rotational transformation to the variables corresponding to the principal axes of the bivariate transition density, which empirically was observed to be more accurate than the use of Cholesky transformation. Numerical comparison demonstrates that the new algorithm is significantly faster than the partial differential equation or Monte Carlo methods. For pricing of GMWB with dynamic withdrawal strategy, we found that for positive correlation between the underlying asset and interest rate, the GMWB price under the stochastic interest rate is significantly higher compared to the case of deterministic interest rate, while for negative correlation the difference is less but still significant. In the case of GMWB with predefined (static) withdrawal strategy, for negative correlation, the difference in prices between stochastic and deterministic interest rate cases is not material while for positive correlation the difference is still significant. The algorithm can be easily adapted to solve similar stochastic control problems with two stochastic variables possibly affected by control. Application to numerical pricing of Asian, barrier and other financial derivatives with a single risky asset under stochastic interest rate is also straightforward. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A notable example is in the context of hedging a derivative where the underlying security is either non-tradable or not sufficiently liquid. Other examples include hedging longevity risk using index-based longevity instrument and hedging crop yields using weather derivatives. These applications give rise to basis risk and it is imperative that such a risk needs to be taken into consideration for the adopted hedging strategy. In this paper, we consider the problem of hedging a European option using another correlated and liquidly traded asset and we investigate an optimal construction of hedging portfolio involving such an asset. The mean-variance criterion is adopted to evaluate the hedging performance, and a subgame Nash equilibrium is used to define the optimal solution. The problem is solved by resorting to a dynamic programming procedure and a change-of-measure technique. A closed-form optimal control process is obtained under a diffusion model setup. The solution we obtain is highly tractable and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the analytical solution exists for dynamic hedging of general European options with basis risk under the mean-variance criterion. Examples on hedging European call options are presented to foster the feasibility and importance of our optimal hedging strategy in the presence of basis risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The approach of the data-driven smooth test is employed to construct the test statistics. The asymptotic independence between the two stages facilitates proper control of the overall type I error of the sequential test. We derive the asymptotic null distribution of the test, which is free of nuisance parameters, and we establish its consistency.

An identified uncertainty shock in the data causes significant declines in output, consumption, investment, and hours worked. Standard general-equilibrium models with flexible prices cannot reproduce this comovement. However, uncertainty shocks can easily generate comovement with countercyclical markups through sticky prices. Monetary policy plays a key role in offsetting the negative impact of uncertainty shocks during normal times. Higher uncertainty has even more negative effects if monetary policy can no longer perform its usual stabilizing function because of the zero lower bound. We calibrate our uncertainty shock process using fluctuations in implied stock market volatility, and show that the model with nominal price rigidity is consistent with empirical evidence from a structural vector autoregression. We argue that increased uncertainty about the future likely played a role in worsening the Great Recession. The economic mechanism we identify applies to a large set of shocks that change expectations of the future without changing current fundamentals.","[Basu, Susanto] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Basu, Susanto] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bundick, Brent] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA",Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Basu, S (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.;Basu, S (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",susanto.basu@bc.edu; brent.bundick@kc.frb.org,,,,,,,36,318,366,11,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2017,85.0,3,,,,,937,958,,10.3982/ECTA13960,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EX3ER,,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Published",Y,N,2024-03-10,WOS:000403115300008,0

We propose a testing strategy based on a subsampling method in which a suitable test statistic is calculated on a finite number of end-of-sample observations, with a critical value obtained using subsample test statistics calculated on the remaining observations. This approach also has the practical advantage that, by virtue of how the critical values are obtained, it can deliver tests which are robust to, among other things, conditional heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in the driving shocks. We also explore modifications of the raw statistics to account for unconditional heteroskedasticity using studentization and a White-type correction. We evaluate the finite sample size and power properties of our proposed procedures and find that they offer promising levels of power, suggesting the possibility for earlier detection of end-of-sample bubble episodes compared to existing procedures.","[Astill, Sam; Taylor, A.

We consider the case where every firm uses dual utility (also called a distortion risk measure) to evaluate risk. We characterize optimal risk redistributions via four properties that need to be satisfied jointly. The characterized risk redistribution is unique under three conditions. Whereas we characterize risk redistributions by means of properties, we can also use some results to study competitive equilibria. We characterize uniqueness of the competitive equilibrium in markets with dual utilities. Finally, we identify two conditions that are jointly necessary and sufficient for the case that there exists a trade that is welfare-improving for all firms.","[Boonen, Tim J.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Boonen, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.j.boonen@uva.nl,"Boonen, Tim/AAJ-7757-2020","Boonen, Tim/0000-0001-9186-416X",,,,,57,2,2,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2017,47.0,1,,,,,303,329,,10.1017/asb.2016.34,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EH1ZM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391566900009,0

The test has high power against alternatives where the misspecification is in the GARCH parameters and is superior to other tests.

This decision is influenced by characteristics of the order flows and queue sizes in each limit order book, as well as the structure of transaction fees and rebates across exchanges. We propose a quantitative framework for studying this order placement problem by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. This formulation allows the study of how the optimal order placement decision depends on the interplay between the state of order books, the fee structure, order flow properties and the aversion to execution risk. In the case of a single exchange, we derive an explicit solution for the optimal split between limit and market orders. For the general case of order placement across multiple exchanges, we propose a stochastic algorithm that computes the optimal routing policy and study the sensitivity of the solution to various parameters. Our algorithm does not require an explicit statistical model of order flow but exploits data on recent order fills across exchanges in the numerical implementation of the algorithm to acquire this information through a supervised learning procedure.","[Cont, Rama] Imperial Coll, Dept Math, London, England; [Cont, Rama] Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, CNRS, Paris, France; [Kukanov, Arseniy] AQR Capital Management LLC, Greenwich, CT USA",Imperial College London; Universite Paris Cite; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Cont, R (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, Dept Math, London, England.;Cont, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, CNRS, Paris, France.",Rama.Cont@imperial.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,18,22,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We systematically explain the role that duplex banking networks play in different aspects of risk contagion. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we conclude that asymmetric information interaction would increase the inflexibility of the system, which leads to liquidity shortage and possibly the collapse of the whole market. The weakness of systemic risk in the interior of the complex banking system can be characterized by the partial discount factor using illiquid assets in the information network. By improving the connectedness of the information network of the duplex networks, the spread of contagion can be partially slowed.","[Ding, Ding; Han, Liyan] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, 37 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Libo] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yin, LB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yinlibowsxbb@126.com,"Yin, Libo/Q-7525-2017; Yin, Libo/AAJ-1976-2021","Yin, Libo/0000-0003-0193-6735","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671193, 71371022]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under projects [grant number 71671193], and [grant number 71371022] and Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.",,41,18,20,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We conduct a horse race of conventional statistical methods and more recent machine learning methods as early-warning models. As individual models are in the literature most often built in isolation of other methods, the exercise is of high relevance for assessing the relative performance of a wide variety of methods. Further, we test various ensemble approaches to aggregating the information products of the built models, providing more robust basis for measuring country-level vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide approaches to estimating model uncertainty in early-warning exercises, particularly model performance uncertainty and model output uncertainty. The approaches put forward in this paper are shown with Europe as a playground. Generally, our results show that the conventional statistical approaches are outperformed by more advanced machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbours and neural networks, and particularly by model aggregation approaches through ensemble learning.","[Holopainen, Markus; Sarlin, Peter] Arcada Univ Appl Sci, RiskLab Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Sarlin, Peter] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Excellence SAFE, Frankfurt, Germany; [Sarlin, Peter] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Arkadiankatu 22, Helsinki 00100, Finland",Arcada University of Applied Sciences; Goethe University Frankfurt; Hanken School of Economics,"Sarlin, P (通讯作者)，Arcada Univ Appl Sci, RiskLab Finland, Helsinki, Finland.;Sarlin, P (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Ctr Excellence SAFE, Frankfurt, Germany.;Sarlin, P (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Arkadiankatu 22, Helsinki 00100, Finland.",peter@risklab.fi,,,GRI in Financial Services; Louis Bachelier Institute,GRI in Financial Services; Louis Bachelier Institute,"We are grateful to Johannes Beutel, Andras Fulop, Benjamin Klaus, Jan-Hannes Lang, Tuomas A.

This problem can be formulated as a mathematical model with the quadratic objective function and a set of equality or inequality constraints. Nevertheless, this quadratic programming model can be difficult to solve. Our approach introduced in this paper is based on a piecewise linearization of the quadratic objective function. This integer programming model enables to include to the problem some other significant aspects of time coordination of bus arrivals.

While almost all the existing literature on optimal reinsurance are based on a probabilistic derivation, the present paper relies on a statistical analysis. The proposed optimal reinsurance models are directly formulated on empirical data and no explicit distributional assumption on the underlying risk vector is required. The resulting nonparametric reinsurance models are convex and computationally amenable, circumventing the difficulty of computing CVaR of the sum of a generally dependent random vector. Statistical consistency of the resulting estimators for the best CVaR is established for both nonparametric models, allowing empirical data to be generated from any stationary process satisfying strong mixing conditions. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to show that a routine bootstrap procedure can capture the distributions of the resulting risk measures well for independent data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To protect the rights of pension members who die before retirement, a return of premiums clause is introduced, under which a member who dies before retirement can withdraw all the premiums she has contributed. We assume that the financial market consists of one risk-free asset and multiple risky assets, the returns of the risky assets depend on the market states, the evolution of the market states is described by a Markov chain, and the transition matrixes are time varying. The pension fund manager aims to maximize the expected terminal wealth of each surviving member at retirement and to minimize the risk measured by the variance of her terminal wealth, which are two conflicting objectives. We formulate the investment problem as a discrete-time mean-variance model. Since the model is time-inconsistent, we seek its pre-commitment and equilibrium strategies. Using the embedding technique and the dynamic programming method, we obtain the pre-commitment strategy and the corresponding efficient frontier in closed form. Applying the game theory and the extended Bellman equation, we derive the analytical expressions of the equilibrium strategy and the corresponding efficient frontier.

The existing methods (e.g., Chen (2010, Review of Economic Studies 77, 127-153)) that ignore heteroskedasticity often result in inconsistent estimators of regression functions. In this paper, we show that both the regression and heteroskedasticity functions are identified in a location-scale setting. Based on our constructive identification results, we propose kernel-based estimators of regression and heteroskedasticity functions and show that the estimators are asymptotically normally distributed. Our simulations demonstrate that our new method performs well in finite samples. In particular, we confirm that in the presence of heteroskedasticity, our new estimator of the regression function has a much smaller bias than Chen's (2010, Review of Economic Studies 77, 127-153) estimator.","[Chen, Songnian; Lu, Xun] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xianbo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yahong] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Sun Yat Sen University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, SN (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",snchen@ust.hk,,"Chen, Songnian/0000-0002-6285-9756",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371199],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We gratefully thank the Co-editor Liangjun Su and three anonymous referees for their many constructive comments.

The optimal exercise boundary for the volatility is obtained as the unique solution to an integral equation of Volterra type. We also consider a model mixing these two classes and formulate the corresponding optimal stopping problem in terms of the observed factor process.

However, information about the effects of various modelling decisions on adherence measures such as the medication possession ratio (MPR) is limited. We address this gap with this study. We utilized cross-sectional administrative claims data for commercially insured members filling at least two prescriptions for drugs within five classes of hypertension medication between 2008 and 2010. We divided nine modelling decisions into three categories: data scrubbing, study design, and MPR definition/calculations. We defined the base-case settings with commonly used values, varied each modelling decision singly and in combination, and measured the effects on the MPR. Claims data for 358,418 individuals were available for analysis. Two modelling decisions were found to be highly influential, each yielding a difference of over 25 percentage points from the base case: the decision of whether to use interval- or prescription-based study periods, and the decision of how to handle overlapping prescription claims. The effect of other decisions was smaller, with a difference of 1-9 percentage points from the base case. Some of the decisions considered had a large impact on the MPR. Therefore, it is important for researchers to standardize approaches for study period length and overlapping prescription claims. We also conclude that transparent reporting of modelling decisions will facilitate the interpretation of results and comparisons across studies.","[Bjarnadottir, Margret V.] Univ Maryland, Dept Decis Operat & Informat Technol, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Czerwinski, David] San Jose State Univ, Dept Mkt & Decis Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Onukwugha, Eberechukwu] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; California State University System; San Jose State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Onukwugha, E (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",eonukwug@rx.umaryland.edu,,,,,,,43,10,12,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,369,380,,10.1007/s40273-017-0597-y,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29230712.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800010,0

We assume that the retiree's preferences exhibit constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), that is, the retiree's utility function is exponential. The retiree invests in a financial market with one riskless and one risky asset, the so-called Black-Scholes market. Moreover, the retiree may purchase single-premium immediate life annuity income that is payable continuously, and she may purchase this life annuity income at any time and for any amount, subject to the limit of her available wealth. Because maximizing exponential utility generally does not prevent wealth from dropping below 0, we restrict the investment, consumption, and annuitization strategies so that wealth remains non-negative. We solve the optimization problem via stochastic control and obtain semi-explicit solutions by using the Legendre dual. We prove that the optimal annuitization strategy is a barrier strategy. We also provide some numerical examples to illustrate our results and to analyze their sensitivity to the parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

That is, in the tBRD, an agent is more likely to revise his action when his current payoff is further from the optimal payoff, and he always switches to an optimal action when revising. The tBRD is a payoff monotone selection like the replicator dynamic, which makes medium and long-run outcomes more consistent with predictions from equilibrium refinement than the BRD in some situations. The technical contribution of the tBRD is continuous sensitivity, which allows us to apply results of a system of piecewise differential equations in order to obtain conditions for uniqueness and stability of solutions.","[Zusai, Dai] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,RA 873 004-04, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Zusai, D (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Econ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,RA 873 004-04, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",zusai@temple.edu,,,Richard E.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model developed in Microsoft((R)) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately 45,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of approximately 143,000 pound per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately 49,000 pound per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments including both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the discount agreed in the PAS.","[Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C.; de Groot, Saskia; de Almeida, Fernando Albuquerque; Al, Maiwenn J.] Erasmus Univ, IMTA, Inst Hlth Policy & Management IBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Fayter, Debra; Wolff, Robert; Armstrong, Nigel; Stirk, Lisa; Worthy, Gill; Kleijnen, Jos] Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Kleijnen, Jos] Maastricht Univ, Dept Family Med, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Maastricht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Kleijnen Systematic Reviews; Maastricht University,"Büyükkaramikli, NC (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, IMTA, Inst Hlth Policy & Management IBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",buyukkaramikli@imta.eur.nl,"Wolff, Robert/E-2322-2016; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./V-3982-2018","Wolff, Robert/0000-0003-3270-7791; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./0000-0002-2021-9574; Albuquerque de Almeida, Fernando/0000-0001-8528-2702; de Groot, Saskia/0000-0003-2782-3114",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program [13/104/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program (project number 13/104/01 STA) (see the HTA program website for further information-http://www.hta.ac.uk).

The numerical results indicate that the proposed valuation algorithm is very efficient under a broad range of asset return models.

In particular, we consider a hedger who wishes to minimize the variance of her hedging error using index-based longevity-linked derivatives. To cope with the fact that liquidity of longevity-linked derivatives is still limited, we consider a liquidity constrained case where the hedger can only trade longevity-linked derivatives at a frequency lower than other assets. Time-consistent, closed-form solutions of optimal hedging strategies are obtained under a forward mortality framework. In the numerical illustration, we show that lowering the trading of the longevity-linked derivatives to a 2-year frequency only leads to a slight loss of the hedging performance. Moreover, even when the longevity-linked derivatives are traded at a very low (5-year) frequency, dynamic hedging strategies still significantly outperform the static one.","[Li, Hong] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tongyan Rd 38, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China",Nankai University,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tongyan Rd 38, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.",hong.li@nankai.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [63172089],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The author is grateful to the editor, A.

We unprecedentedly examine this issue on the SSE 50 ETF option in the Chinese derivatives market. To measure the price pressure in the options market, we construct an implied volatility spread based on pairs of the SSE 50 ETF option with identical expiration dates and strike prices. By regressing the implied volatility spread on past stock returns, we find that past stock returns exert a strong influence on the pricing of index options. Specifically, we find that SSE 50 ETF calls are significantly overvalued relative to SSE 50 ETF puts after stock price increases and the reverse is also true after the stock price decreases. Moreover, we validate the momentum effects in the underlying stock market to be responsible for the price pressure. These findings are both economically and statistically significant and have important implications.","[Li, Jianping; Yao, Yanzhen; Chen, Yibing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping; Yao, Yanzhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yibing] Natl Council Social Secur Fund, Beijing 100032, Peoples R China; [Lee, Cheng-Few] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick","Chen, YB (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Chen, YB (通讯作者)，Natl Council Social Secur Fund, Beijing 100032, Peoples R China.",yibingch@ssf.gov.cn,"Li, Jianping/A-9544-2012","Li, Jianping/0000-0003-4976-4119","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71425002, 71601178]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M581177, 2016T90139]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y7X0231508]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This research has been supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71425002], [grant number 71601178]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2015M581177], [grant number 2016T90139]; the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [grant number Y7X0231508].",,44,12,12,2,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The remarkable feature of this model is that the investor can explicitly take either a long, short or square position and can switch the position, with transaction costs, during the investment period. We run empirical simulations of such multiple-regime switching models. There are very few such attempts in the existing literature because it is difficult to find, first, an explicit solution to the problem and second, appropriate financial assets that follow the artificial stochastic process required by the mathematical model. According to the Monte Carlo simulations of the optimal pair-trading strategy, the mean daily Sharp ratio is more than 2.3, whereas the mean Sharp ratio for the historical simulation of the 'stub' pairs (combinations of parent/subsidiary companies) is 0.6886. We believe that the results obtained from performing the empirical simulations are remarkable and consider that the optimal switching strategy of the rigorous mathematical model is applicable to businesses in the real world. For the reference many pseudo-program codes are added, which can help to replicate the optimal trading strategies.","[Suzuki, Kiyoshi] Nomura Secur Co LTD, Portfolio Consulting Dept, Chiyoda Ku, Urbannet Otemachi Bldg,2-2-2 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008130, Japan",,"Suzuki, K (通讯作者)，Nomura Secur Co LTD, Portfolio Consulting Dept, Chiyoda Ku, Urbannet Otemachi Bldg,2-2-2 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008130, Japan.",abbeyroad20@outlook.com,,,,,,,37,6,7,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We show that the estimated asymptotic standard errors for spatial autoregressive parameters can be substantially smaller than their empirical counterparts. Hence, we extend the finite sample variance correction methodology of Windmeijer (2005) to the OGMME for the SARAR(1, 1) model. Results from simulation studies indicate that the correction method improves the variance estimates in small samples and leads to more accurate inference for the spatial autoregressive parameters. For the same model, we compare the finite sample properties of various test statistics for linear restrictions on autoregressive parameters. These tests include the standard asymptotic Wald test based on various GMMEs, a bootstrapped version of the Wald test, two versions of the C() test, the standard Lagrange multiplier (LM) test, the minimum chi-square test (MC), and two versions of the generalized method of moments (GMM) criterion test.

Based on the Girsanov-type measure transformation for general jump-diffusion processes, we derive the evolution of the interest rate under the equivalent martingale measure and an explicit expression of the zero-coupon bond pricing formula. Furthermore, we give a pricing formula for the European call option written on zero-coupon bonds. Finally, we provide an interpretation for the clustering effects in the interest rate model within a simple framework of general equilibrium.

Despite the heavy toll of lung cancer, multiple new advances have improved patient outcomes, largely through precision medicine and targeted therapy. The associated rising economic burden however may impact the uptake of novel therapeutic agents in lung cancer, thereby limiting patient access. This article identifies and reviews economic evaluations of targeted agents in lung cancer in the era of precision medicine. Articles evaluating biomarker-directed test-and-treat strategies are also reviewed to evaluate the cost impact of novel therapeutic agents at a population level. The Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument is applied to assess the quality of included studies. Forty-six studies are reviewed and encompass studies of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors and immunotherapy (programmed death-1 inhibitors). Key factors influencing results of economic analyses include comparators chosen, perspective used, magnitude of clinical benefit, utility weighting of outcomes and drug acquisition costs. Biomarker-driven decision making should be integrated into cost evaluations given the important role of molecular testing for individualising treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer. We conclude that despite major clinical advances in lung cancer therapeutics, cost remains an important consideration in the adoption of novel therapies.","[Albaba, Hamzeh; Lim, Charles; Leighl, Natasha B.] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, 700 Univ Ave,Room 7-913, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z5, Canada; [Albaba, Hamzeh; Lim, Charles; Leighl, Natasha B.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; University of Toronto,"Leighl, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, 700 Univ Ave,Room 7-913, Toronto, ON M5G 1Z5, Canada.;Leighl, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",Natasha.Leighl@uhn.ca,"Albaba, Hamzeh/KBA-3642-2024; Lim, Charles/V-4394-2019",,,,,,91,16,18,1,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,12,,,,,1195,1209,,10.1007/s40273-017-0563-8,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FM8GP,28861770.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415324600001,0

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab monotherapy (RAM), compared with best supportive care (BSC), was based on data from the REGARD trial. Clinical effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab combination therapy (RAM + PAC), compared with paclitaxel monotherapy (PAC), was based on data from the RAINBOW trial. In addition, the company undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare RAM + PAC with BSC and docetaxel. Cost-effectiveness evidence of monotherapy and combination therapy relied on partitioned survival, cost-utility models. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the company was A 188,640 pound (vs BSC) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for monotherapy and A 118,209 pound (vs BSC) per QALY gained for combination therapy. The ERG assessment indicated that the modelling structure represented the course of the disease; however, a few errors were identified and some of the input parameters were challenged. The ERG provided a new base case, with ICERs (vs BSC) of A 188,100 pound (monotherapy) per QALY gained and A 129,400 pound (combination therapy) per QALY gained and conducted additional exploratory analyses. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC), considered the company's decision problem was in line with the NICE scope, with the exception of the choice of comparators for the combination therapy model. The most plausible ICER for ramucirumab monotherapy compared with BSC was A 188,100 pound per QALY gained. The Committee considered that the ERG's exploratory analysis in which RAM + PAC was compared with PAC by using the direct head-to-head data (including utilities) from the RAINBOW trial, provided the most plausible ICER (i.e. A 408,200 pound per QALY gained) for ramucirumab combination therapy. The Committee concluded that end-of-life considerations cannot be applied for either case, since neither failed to offer an extension to life of at least 3 months. The company did not submit a patient access scheme (PAS). After consideration of the evidence, the Committee concluded that ramucirumab alone or with paclitaxel could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources for treating advanced GC/GOJ patients that were previously treated with chemotherapy, and therefore its use could not be recommended. We might wonder if a complete STA process is necessary for treatments without a PAS, which are, according to the company's submission, already associated with ICERs far above the currently accepted threshold in all (base-case, sensitivity and scenario) analyses.","[Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C.; Blommestein, Hedwig M.; Severens, Johan; Al, Maiwenn J.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Riemsma, Rob; Armstrong, Nigel; Ross, Janine; Worthy, Gill; Kleijnen, Jos] Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Clay, Fiona J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Clay, Fiona J.] Monash Univ, Dept Forens Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kleijnen, Jos] Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Family Med, Maastricht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Kleijnen Systematic Reviews; University of Melbourne; Monash University; Maastricht University,"Buyukkaramikli, NC (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",buyukkaramikli@imta.eur.nl,"Ross, Janine/C-7380-2019; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./V-3982-2018","Ross, Janine/0000-0002-4763-2078; Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C./0000-0002-2021-9574; Blommestein, Hedwig/0000-0002-5846-0531",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program [14/177/03 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program,"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Program (project number 14/177/03 STA) [see the HTA program website for further information-http://www.hta.ac.uk].

Registries contain information otherwise unavailable to healthcare activity/cost monitoring systems. We estimated the direct medical cost of CF care using registry data and examined how cost was affected by patient characteristics and CF gene (CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [CFTR]) mutation. Healthcare resource utilisation data (2008-2012) were obtained for CF patients enrolled with the Irish CF Registry by 2013 from linked registry and national hospitalisation database records. Mean annual hospitalisation and medication per-patient costs were estimated by demographic profile, CFTR mutation, clinical status, and CF co-morbidity, and were presented in 2014 euro values. A mixed-effects regression model was used to examine the effect of demographic, CFTR mutation, and clinical outcomes on the log(10) cost of direct medical CF care. Using 4261 observations from 1100 patients, we found that the median annual total cost per patient increased over the period 2008-2012 from a,notsign12,659 to a,notsign16,852, inpatient bed-day cost increased from a,notsign14,026 to a,notsign17,332, and medication cost increased from a,notsign5863 to a,notsign12,467. Homozygous F508-CFTR mutation (class II) cost was highest and milder mutation (class IV/V) cost was 49% lower. Baseline estimated cost in 2008 for a hypothetical underweight, homozygous F508del-CFTR 6-year-old female without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa/Staphylococcus aureus, CF-related diabetes (CFRD) or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and with a poor percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV(1)) was a,notsign10,113, and was a,notsign21,082 in a 25-year-old with the same hypothetical profile. Chronic P. aeruginosa infection increased baseline cost by 39%, CF co-morbidity diabetes by 18%, and frequency of pulmonary exacerbation by 15%. Underweight, declining ppFEV(1), chronic S. aureus colonisation, and time also influenced cost. CFTR mutation is an important factor influencing the cost of CF care. Costs differ among cohorts of CF patients eligible to access new and emerging CFTR repair therapies. These findings support the evaluation of outcome-associated cost in CFTR mutation-specific CF patient groups.","[Jackson, Abaigeal D.; Fletcher, Godfrey; Harrington, Mary; Zhou, Shijun] UCD Belfield, Cyst Fibrosis Registry Ireland, Woodview House, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Jackson, Andrew L.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Zool Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Doyle, Gerardine] UCD Sch Business, Quinn Sch Business, Room Q210, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Cullinane, Fiona] UCD Belfield, UCD Sch Publ Hlth Physiotherapy & Sport Sci, Woodview House, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Gallagher, Charles; McKone, Edward] St Vincents Univ Hosp, Elm Pk, Dublin 4, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin; Saint Vincent's University Hospital,"Jackson, AD (通讯作者)，UCD Belfield, Cyst Fibrosis Registry Ireland, Woodview House, Dublin 4, Ireland.",Abaigeal.jackson@ucd.ie,"; Jackson, Andrew/D-3441-2009","Jackson, Abaigeal/0000-0002-9030-0036; Jackson, Andrew/0000-0001-7334-0434",Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated(Vertex Pharmaceuticals),Funding support for this study was provided by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.,,54,8,11,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2017,35.0,10,,,,,1087,1101,,10.1007/s40273-017-0530-4,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FH7AR,28699086.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411333800009,0

We propose for the model a two-stage kernel-weighted least squares estimator by generalizing the idea of local partitioned mean regression (Christopeit and Hoderlein, 2006, Econometrica 74, 787-817) to a quantile regression framework. The proposed estimator is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties under standard regularity conditions. The new estimator has three advantages relative to existing methods. First, it is structurally simple and widely applicable to the general model as well as its submodels. Second, both the functional coefficients and their derivatives up to any given order can be estimated. Third, the procedure readily extends to censored data, including fixed or random censoring. A Monte Carlo experiment indicates that the proposed estimator performs well in finite samples.

Insurers will be required to valuate their insurance liabilities on a risk-adjusted basis to allow for uncertainty inherent in cash flows that arise from the liability of insurance contracts. Whilst most European-based insurers are expected to adopt the Cost of Capital approach to calculate reserve risk margin - the risk adjustment method commonly agreed under Solvency II and IFRS 17, there is one additional requirement of IFRS 17 to also disclose confidence level of the risk margin. Given there is no specific guidance on the calculation of confidence level, the purpose of this paper is to explore and examine practical ways of estimating the risk margin confidence level measured by Probability of Sufficiency (PoS). The paper provides some practical approximation formulae that would allow one to quickly estimate the implied PoS of Solvency II risk margin for a given non-life insurance liability, the risk profile of which is specified by the type and characteristics of the liability (e.g. type/nature of business, liability duration and convexity, etc.), which, in turn, are associated with the level of variability measured by Coefficient of Variation (CoV); t he degree of Skewness per unit of CoV; and the degree of Kurtosis per unit of CoV2.

The range of software programs used for their implementation has also increased, but it remains true that a small number of programs account for the vast majority of cost-effectiveness modelling work. We report a comparison of four software programs: TreeAge Pro, Microsoft Excel, R and MATLAB. Our focus is on software commonly used for building Markov models and decision trees to conduct cohort simulations, given their predominance in the published literature around cost-effectiveness modelling. Our comparison uses three qualitative criteria as proposed by Eddy et al.: transparency and validation, learning curve and capability. In addition, we introduce the quantitative criterion of processing speed. We also consider the cost of each program to academic users and commercial users. We rank the programs based on each of these criteria. We find that, whilst Microsoft Excel and TreeAge Pro are good programs for educational purposes and for producing the types of analyses typically required by health technology assessment agencies, the efficiency and transparency advantages of programming languages such as MATLAB and R become increasingly valuable when more complex analyses are required.","[Hollman, Chase; Paulden, Mike; McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad 3 264, 11405 87 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Pechlivanoglou, Petros] Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pechlivanoglou, Petros] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pechlivanoglou, Petros] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Paulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad 3 264, 11405 87 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.;Paulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",paulden@ualberta.ca,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980",Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR); Genome Canada; Capital Health Research Chair in Emergency Medicine Research,Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Genome Canada(Genome Canada); Capital Health Research Chair in Emergency Medicine Research,This study was funded through grants from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) and Genome Canada.

We axiomatically develop a theory of pure, direct altruism: Altruism is pure if it concerns the total utility (rather than the mere consumption utility) of future generations, and direct if it directly incorporates the utility of all future generations. Our axioms deliver a new class of altruistic, forward-looking preferences, whose weight put on the consumption of a future generation generally depends on the consumption of other generations. The only preferences lacking this dependence correspond to the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model, which our theory characterizes. Our approach provides a framework to analyze welfare in the presence of altruistic preferences and addresses technical challenges stemming from the interdependent nature of such preferences.","[Galperti, Simone] UC, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Strulovici, Bruno] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of San Diego; Northwestern University,"Galperti, S (通讯作者)，UC, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.",sgalperti@ucsd.edu; b-strulovici@northwestern.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1151410]; Sloan Research Fellowship; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1151410] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sloan Research Fellowship(Alfred P.

Assessments of baseline health-related quality of life are problematic where trial participants are incapacitated or critically ill at the time of randomisation. This review aims to identify and critique methods for handling non-availability of baseline health-related quality of life data in trial-based cost-utility analyses within emergency and critical illness settings. A systematic literature review was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines, to identify trial-based cost-utility analyses of interventions within emergency and critical care settings. Databases searched included the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Journals Library (1991-July 2016), Cochrane Library (all years); National Health Service (NHS) Economic Evaluation Database (all years) and Ovid MEDLINE/Embase (without time restriction). Strategies employed to handle non-availability of baseline health-related quality of life data in final QALY estimations were identified and critiqued. A total of 4224 published reports were screened, 19 of which met the study inclusion criteria (mean trial size 1670): 14 (74 %) from the UK, four (21%) from other European countries and one (5%) from India. Twelve studies (63%) were based in emergency departments and seven (37%) in intensive care units. Only one study was able to elicit patient-reported health-related quality of life at baseline. To overcome the lack of baseline data when estimating QALYs, eight studies (42%) assigned a fixed utility weight corresponding to either death, an unconscious health state or a country-specific norm to patients at baseline, four (21%) ignored baseline utilities, three (16%) applied values from another study, one (5%) generated utility values via retrospective recall and one (5%) elicited utilities from experts. A preliminary exploration of these methods shows that incremental QALY estimation is unlikely to be biased if balanced trial allocation is achieved and subsequent collection of health-related quality of life data occurs at the earliest possible opportunity following commencement of treatment, followed by an adequate number of follow-up assessments. Trial-based cost-utility analyses within emergency and critical illness settings have applied different methods for QALY estimation, employing disparate assumptions about the health-related quality of life of patients at baseline. Where baseline measurement is not practical, measurement at the earliest opportunity following commencement of treatment should minimise bias in QALY estimation.","[Dritsaki, Melina] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford Clin Trials Res Unit, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; [Achana, Felix; Mason, James; Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV8 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Oxford; University of Warwick,"Dritsaki, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford Clin Trials Res Unit, Oxford OX3 7LD, England.",melina.dritsaki@ndorms.ox.ac.uk,"Mason, James M/D-9904-2011; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Mason, James/0000-0001-9210-4082","Medical Research Council [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: Medline; MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,46,14,15,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2017,35.0,5,,,,,501,515,,10.1007/s40273-016-0485-x,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER9SS,28063084.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399167600002,0

The model accounts for business cycles using a two-state Markov switching model, and allows for dynamic leverage adjustment by the insured firms. The new proposed model, which incorporates risk-based capital practice, is better for both the insurer and the insured firms. Based on the risk-adjusted performance metric, we found that the insurer is better off insuring short- and medium-term loans in expansion and steady states, while it is better off backing both short- and long-term loans in recessions.

The analysis is based on the model of bargaining with asymmetric information by Bebchuk (1984). I provide conditions for the nonparametric identification of the model, propose a consistent nonparametric estimator, and implement it using data on criminal cases from North Carolina. Employing the estimated model, I evaluate how different sentencing reforms affect the outcome of criminal cases. My results indicate that lower mandatory minimum sentences could greatly reduce the total amount of incarceration time assigned by the courts, but may increase conviction rates. In contrast, the broader use of non-incarceration sentences for less serious crimes reduces the number of incarceration convictions, but has a very small effect over the total assigned incarceration time. I also consider the effects of a ban on plea bargains. Depending on the case characteristics, over 20 percent of the defendants who currently receive incarceration sentences would be acquitted if plea bargains were forbidden.","[Silveira, Bernardo S.] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, One Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Silveira, BS (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, One Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1133, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",silveira@wustl.edu,,,,,,,48,10,22,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2017,85.0,2,,,,,419,452,,10.3982/ECTA12974,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EX3EM,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403114800003,0

The null hypothesis can be characterized as infinitely many of unconditional moment inequalities. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is constructed based on these unconditional moment inequalities, and a simulated critical value is proposed. It is shown that our test can control the size uniformly over a broad set of data-generating processes asymptotically, that it is consistent against fixed alternatives and that it is unbiased against some N-1/2 local alternatives. Several extensions of our test are also considered and we apply our tests to examine the effect of a job-training programme on real earnings.","[Hsu, Yu-Chin] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Hsu, YC (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",ychsu@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST103-2628-H-001-001-MY4]; Career Development Award of Academia Sinica, Taiwan; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Career Development Award of Academia Sinica, Taiwan; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I thank Victor Chernozhukov, Jason Abrevaya, Yoichi Arai, Le-Yu Chen, Richard Chiburis, Stephen G.

Results are also derived for the orthogonalized estimated IRs which are generally more practically relevant. Simulation evidence strongly indicates the desirability of applying the Kilian small sample bias correction, which is found to improve the coverage accuracy of confidence intervals for IRs.

This is done under the alternative hypotheses of weak and strong factors. By weak factors, we mean that the Euclidean norm of the vector of the factor loadings is O(1). By strong factors, we mean that the Euclidean norm of the vector of factor loadings is O(root n), where n is the number of individuals in the panel. To derive the limiting distribution of J(BFK) under the alternative, we first derive the limiting distribution of its raw data counterpart. Our results show that, when the factor is strong, the test statistic diverges in probability to infinity as fast as O-p(nT). However, when the factor is weak, its limiting distribution is a rightward mean shift of the limit distribution under the null. Second, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the difference between J(BFK) and its raw data counterpart. Our results show that when the factor is strong, this difference is as large as O-p(n). In contrast, when the factor is weak, this difference converges in probability to a constant. Taken together, these results imply that when the factor is strong, J(BFK) is consistent, but when the factor is weak, J(BFK) is inconsistent even though its asymptotic power is nontrivial.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Leicester, Leics, England; [Kao, Chihwa] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Wang, Fa] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; University of Leicester; University of Connecticut; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479",,,,,28,3,3,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

The study is based on longitudinal data recording marital status and socio-professional features at census times, therefore the observation scheme is interval-censored since individual characteristics are only observed at isolated dates and transition times remain unknown. To this aim, we develop a parametric maximum likelihood estimation procedure for multi-state models that takes into account both interval-censoring and reversible transitions. This method, inspired by recent advances in the statistical literature, allows us to capture characteristic-specific mortality rates, in particular to recover the mortality compensation law at high ages, but also to capture the age pattern of characteristics changes. The dynamics of several population compositions is addressed, and allows us to give explanations on the pattern of aggregate mortality, as well as on the impact on typical life insurance products. Particular attention is devoted to characteristic changes and parameter uncertainty that are both crucial to take into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we propose a new semiparametric estimator of regression coefficients, which is in the form of a feasible generalized ridge estimator by Hoerl and Kennard (1970b) but with different biasing factors. We prove that after reparameterization such that the regressors are orthogonal, the generalized ridge estimator is algebraically identical to the model average estimator. Further, the biasing factors that determine the properties of both the generalized ridge and semiparametric estimators are directly linked to the weights used in model averaging. These are interesting results for the interpretations and applications of both semiparametric and ridge estimators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these estimators based on model averaging weights can have properties superior to the well-known feasible generalized ridge estimator in a large region of the parameter space.

In the absence of analytical European option pricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted variance of Monte Carlo implied volatilities, thereby contributing to the model's calibration by simulation. We employ a novel composition of variance reduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal stochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates with a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we demonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions-roughly 20 times on average, across different correlation regimes.","[McCrickerd, Ryan; Pakkanen, Mikko S.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Pakkanen, MS (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",m.pakkanen@imperial.ac.uk,,"Pakkanen, Mikko/0000-0002-0696-4914",EPSRC CDT,EPSRC CDT(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"R.M. was supported by the EPSRC CDT in Financial Computing and Analytics.

In this paper, we focus on one of the drawbacks of the Poisson Lee-Carter model (Brouhns et al., 2002) that imposes mean-variance equality, restricting mortality variations across individuals. Specifically, we present two models to potentially account for overdispersion. We propose to fit these models within the Bayesian framework for various advantages, but primarily for coherency. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are implemented to carry out parameter estimation. Several comparisons are made with the Bayesian Poisson Lee-Carter model (Czado et al., 2005) to highlight the importance of accounting for overdispersion. We demonstrate that the methodology we developed prevents over-fitting and yields better calibrated prediction intervals for the purpose of mortality projections. Bridge sampling is used to approximate the marginal likelihood of each candidate model to compare the models quantitatively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Wong, Jackie S.

However, the implications of choosing a particular approach remain unclear. We compare the use of the three main diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based national unit costs in England to determine whether choice of approach can impact on economic evaluation results.MethodsA cost-utility model was developed to compare secondary fracture prevention models of care for hip fracture patients, using data from large primary and hospital care administrative datasets in England. A healthcare and personal social services payer perspective was adopted, and utilities were informed by a meta-regression. Hospital resource use was valued using three DRG-based unit costs, and regression-based costing models were developed using data from 13,906 patients to inform the model health states.ResultsFinished consultant episode (FCE)-level reference costs resulted in the highest costs on admission (9075) and in the year of the fracture (14,440) pound. Relative to FCE-level costs, spell-level tariffs led to the lowest total hospital care costs per patient within 1year of fracture (-3691) pound compared with spell-level reference costs (-2106) pound. At a 20,000 pound/quality-adjusted life-year threshold, using spell-level reference costs or spell-level tariffs, the introduction of a nurse-led fracture liaison service model of care was the cost-effective alternative. However, using FCE-level reference costs, usual care was the cost-effective option.Conclusions Our results show that, conditional on the set of national unit costs adopted, the costs of hip fracture may vary considerably and different decisions may be reached regarding the introduction of new healthcare interventions.","[Leal, Jose; Buchanan, James] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Manetti, Stefania] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Management, Pisa, Italy",University of Oxford; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Buchanan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",james.buchanan@dph.ox.ac.uk,"Manetti, Stefania/JEF-4313-2023; Buchanan, James/H-7157-2019","Manetti, Stefania/0000-0002-9652-8293; Buchanan, James/0000-0003-2528-0638; Leal, Jose/0000-0001-7870-6730",NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research programme [11/1023/01],NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research programme,This project was funded by the NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research programme (project number 11/1023/01).,,21,12,12,1,15,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1263,1272,,10.1007/s40273-018-0673-y,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29785689.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800008,0

This paper focusses on the three phases of CML: the chronic phase (CP), the accelerated phase (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BP). The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents the critical review of the company's submission by the ERG and the outcome of the NICE guidance. Clinical evidence for ponatinib was derived from a phase II, industry-sponsored, single-arm, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative study. Despite the limited evidence and potential for biases, this study demonstrated that ponatinib was likely to be an effective treatment (in terms of major cytogenetic response and major haematological response) with an acceptable safety profile for patients with CML. Given the absence of any head-to-head studies comparing ponatinib with other relevant comparators, the company undertook a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) of ponatinib with bosutinib. The approach was only used for patients with CP-CML because comprehensive data were not available for the AP- or BP-CML groups to allow the matching technique to be used. Despite the uncertainty about the MAIC approach, ponatinib was considered likely to offer advantages over bosutinib in the third-line setting, particularly for complete cytogenetic response. The company developed two health economic models to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for the treatment of patients in CP-CML or in advanced CML (AP- or BP-CML, which were modelled separately). The company did not adequately explore the uncertainty in the survivor functions. As a result, the ERG believed the uncertainty in the decision problem was underestimated. Exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG produced the following results for ponatinib. In CP-CML, from A 18,246 pound to A 27,667 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with best supportive care (BSC), from A 19,680 pound to A 37,381 pound per QALY gained compared with bosutinib and from A 18,279 pound per QALY gained to dominated compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). In AP-CML, the cost per QALY gained for ponatinib ranged from A 7123 pound to A 17,625 pound compared with BSC, and from dominating to A 61,896 pound per QALY gained compared with allo-SCT. In BP-CML, the cost effectiveness of ponatinib ranged from A 5033 pound per QALY gained to dominated compared with allo-SCT, although it was likely to be at the more favourable end of this range, and dominant in all scenarios compared with BSC. The NICE appraisal committee concluded that ponatinib is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in the considered population, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the Patient Access Scheme.","[Pandor, Abdullah; Stevenson, Matt; Stevens, John; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Hamilton, Jean; Rawdin, Andrew; Wong, Ruth] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Byrne, Jenny] Nottingham City Hosp, Nottingham NG5 1PB, England; [Rudin, Claudius] Royal Devon & Exeter Hosp, Exeter EX2 5DW, Devon, England",University of Sheffield; Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust; Nottingham City Hospital; University of Exeter,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Hamilton, Jean/0000-0003-3326-9842; Byrne, Jenny/0000-0002-9381-1851; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/51/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project number 16/51/11).

Objective Our purpose was to review the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for both currently vaccine-eligible and non-eligible individuals, particularly the men-who-have-sex-with-men population, and synthesize the available evidence. Methods We systematically searched for published articles in two main databases (PubMed and EMBASE). Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using a validated instrument (Bias in Economic Evaluation, ECOBIAS). Methodological aspects, study results, and sensitivity analyses were extracted and synthesized to generate a consistent overview of the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination in the men-who-have-sex-with-men population. Results From 770 identified articles, four met the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, human papillomavirus vaccination showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominant to US$96,146 and US$14,000 to US$18,200 for tertiary prevention and primary prevention, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio seemed most sensitive to vaccine efficacy, vaccine costs, and the incidence of anal cancer in the selected target populations. Conclusion This review presents the human papillomavirus vaccine, both as a primary and adjuvant (tertiary) vaccination, as a potentially cost-effective strategy for preventing mainly-but not limited to only-anal cancer in men-who-have-sex-with-men populations.","[Setiawan, Didik; Wondimu, Abrham; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTE2, Antonius Deusinglaan 1,Bldg 3214, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Setiawan, Didik] Univ Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Fac Pharm, Purwokerto, Indonesia; [Wondimu, Abrham; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Ong, KohJun] Publ Hlth England, Natl Infect Serv, Ctr Infect Dis Surveillance & Control, London, England; [van Hoek, Albert Jan] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Universitas Muhammadiyah Purwokerto; University of Groningen; Public Health England; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Groningen,"Wondimu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTE2, Antonius Deusinglaan 1,Bldg 3214, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.;Wondimu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands.",d.didiksetiawan@gmail.com; leabrham@gmail.com,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Setiawan, Didik/0000-0001-9104-548X","University of Groningen; Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia","University of Groningen; Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia","These findings are the result of work supported by the University of Groningen and Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) Scholarship, Ministry of National Education, Indonesia.

The study took the perspective and setting of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The model structure was a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Separate analyses based on the number of prior csDMARDs (one and two or more) were conducted, with secukinumab 150 mg compared to standard of care (SoC) and TNFis, respectively, for each subpopulation. Clinical parameters, including response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was A 28,748 pound per QALY gained (one prior csDMARD). Secukinumab 150 mg dominated golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept, and had an ICER of A 5680 pound per QALY gained versus adalimumab and > A 1 pound million saved per QALY foregone versus infliximab (two or more prior csDMARDs). Valuing one QALY at between A 20,000 pound and A 30,000 pound, the probability of secukinumab having the highest net monetary benefit was 48.9% (one prior csDMARD) and 88.9% (two or more prior csDMARDs). Parameters related to Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were most influential. Secukinumab 150 mg at list price appears to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources for adults with PsA who have responded inadequately to one or two or more prior csDMARDs.","[Buchanan, Vanessa; Sullivan, Will] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Graham, Chris; Miles, LaStella] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Jugl, Steffen Marc] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Gunda, Praveen] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Halliday, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, England; [Kirkham, Bruce] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Kirkham, Bruce] Kings Coll London, London, England",Research Triangle Institute; Novartis; Novartis; Novartis; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; King's College London,"Halliday, A (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, England.",anna.halliday@novartis.com,,"Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095; Miles, LaStella/0000-0002-1394-070X","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.",,30,5,5,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2018,36.0,7,,,,,867,878,,10.1007/s40273-018-0674-x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GJ5BX,29797187.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435397300011,0

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the CS for BARI was based predominantly on three randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of BARI against adalimumab or placebo, as well as one long-term extension study. The clinical-effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of BARI against all the comparators within the scope. Therefore, the company performed network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two different populations: one in patients who had experienced an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (cDMARD-IR), and the other in patients who had experienced an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi-IR). The company's NMAs concluded BARI had comparable efficacy as the majority of its comparators in both populations. The company submitted a de novo discrete event simulation model that analysed the incremental cost-effectiveness of BARI versus its comparators for the treatment of RA from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in four different populations: (1) cDMARD-IR patients with moderate RA, defined as a 28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) > 3.2 and no more than 5.1; (2) cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA (defined as a DAS28 > 5.1); (3) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom rituximab (RTX) was eligible; and (4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom RTX in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated. In the cDMARD-IR population with moderate RA, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for BARI in combination with MTX compared with intensive cDMARDs was estimated to be 37,420 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the cDMARD-IR population with severe RA, BARI in combination with MTX dominated all comparators except for certolizumab pegol (CTZ) in combination with MTX, with the ICER of CTZ in combination with MTX compared with BARI in combination with MTX estimated to be 18,400 pound per QALY gained. In the TNFi-IR population with severe RA, when RTX in combination with MTX was an option, BARI in combination with MTX was dominated by RTX in combination with MTX. In the TNFi-IR population with severe RA for whom RTX in combination with MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated, BARI in combination with MTX dominated golimumab in combination with MTX and was less effective and less expensive than the remaining comparators. Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses after applying corrections to the methods used in the NMAs and two programming errors in the economic model that affected the company's probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) results. The ERG's NMA results were broadly comparable with the company's results. The programming error that affected the PSA of the severe cDMARD-IR population had only a minimal impact on the results, while the error affecting the severe TNFi-IR RTX-ineligible population resulted in markedly higher costs and QALYs gained for the affected comparators but did not substantially modify the conclusions of the analysis.

In this paper we show that in general this requires a crucial adjustment to the basic formula. The adjustment is based on a simple idea and straightforward to implement, yet delivers important improvements. It is based on recognizing that certain outcomes are theoretically impossible and the density of the MLE should then equal zero, rather than the positive density that a straight application of p* would suggest. This has implications for inference and we show how to use the new p**-formula to construct improved confidence regions. These can be disjoint as a consequence of the bimodality. The degree of bimodality depends heavily on the value of an approximate ancillary statistic and conditioning on the observed value of this statistic is therefore desirable. The p**-formula naturally delivers the relevant conditional distribution. We illustrate these results in small and large samples using a simple nonlinear regression model and errors in variables model where the measurement errors in dependent and explanatory variables are correlated and allow for weak proxies.","[Van Garderen, Kees Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sowell, Fallaw] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Amsterdam; Carnegie Mellon University,"Van Garderen, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ & Econometr, Roetersstraat 11,POB 15867, NL-1001 NJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",K.J.vanGarderen@uva.nl,"Sowell, Fallaw/AAS-2835-2021","Sowell, Fallaw/0000-0001-5042-7617",,,,,36,0,0,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a summary of the company's evidence, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance (TA440), issued on 26 April 2017. Clinical evidence for liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus 5-FU/LV was derived from 236 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in the multinational, open-label, randomised controlled NAPOLI-1 trial. Results from analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival showed statistically significant improvements for patients treated with liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV compared with those treated with 5-FU/LV. However, 5-FU/LV alone is rarely used in National Health Service clinical practice for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with gemcitabine. The company, ERG and Appraisal Committee (AC) all agreed that oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV is the most commonly used treatment. Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was compared with 5-FU/LV in two trials identified by the company. However, the company and the ERG both considered attempts to compare the efficacy of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV to be methodologically flawed; not only was there heterogeneity between trials and their populations but also the proportional hazards assumption required to conduct a robust indirect treatment comparison (ITC) was violated. Nonetheless, data derived from an ITC were used to inform the company's economic model. Using the discounted patient access scheme price for liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV, the company reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of A 54,412 pound for the comparison with oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. The ERG considered that the company's base-case cost-effectiveness results for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were underestimates and should be interpreted with extreme caution. Following implementation of a number of model amendments, the ERG's modified exploratory ICER for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV was A 106,898 pound per QALY gained. The AC accepted the majority of the ERG's amendments to the model, and also highlighted that the total QALYs for oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV were lower than for 5-FU/LV in the company's model, which the AC considered to be clinically implausible. The AC therefore considered results from exploratory analyses, undertaken by the ERG, which included altering the QALY difference between liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV by +/- 10%. These analyses resulted in ICERs for the comparison of liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV versus oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV of between A 201,019 pound per QALY gained to liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV being dominated by oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV. Therefore, despite uncertainty around the clinical-effectiveness evidence and cost-effectiveness results, the AC was confident that the ICER was in excess of A 50,000 pound per QALY gained. The final guidance issued by NICE is that liposomal irinotecan + 5-FU/LV is not recommended within its marketing authorisation for treating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in adults whose disease has progressed after gemcitabine-based therapy.","[Fleeman, Nigel; Abdulla, Ahmed; Bagust, Adrian; Beale, Sophie; Richardson, Marty; Stainthorpe, Angela; Boland, Angela; Kotas, Eleanor] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [McEntee, Joanne] North West Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England; [Palmer, Daniel] Univ Liverpool, Mol & Clin Canc Med, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Fleeman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",nigel.fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Richardson, Marty/0000-0002-7097-8704; Stainthorpe, Angela/0000-0002-2531-9371",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/121/02],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 15/121/02) [see the Health Technology Assessment programme website for further project information, www.hta.ac.uk].

This paper develops a life-cycle portfolio-choice model in which the investor experiences loss-averse utility over news and can ignore his portfolio. In such a model, the investor prefers to ignore and not rebalance his portfolio most of the time because he dislikes bad news more than he likes good news such that expected news causes a first-order decrease in utility. Consequently, the investor has a first-order willingness to pay a portfolio manager who rebalances actively on his behalf. Moreover, the investor can diversify over time and his consumption aligns with predictions of mental accounting. I structurally estimate the preference parameters by matching stock shares and stock-market non-participation over the life cycle. My parameter estimates are in line with the literature, generate reasonable intervals of inattention, and simultaneously explain consumption and wealth accumulation over the life cycle. Here, it matters that news utility preserves first-order risk aversion even in the presence of stochastic labor income, which also causes stock shares to rise in wealth.","[Pagel, Michaela] Columbia GSB, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Pagel, Michaela] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pagel, Michaela] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Pagel, M (通讯作者)，Columbia GSB, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Pagel, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Pagel, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",mpagel@columbia.edu,,,Psych-and-Econ group at UC Berkeley,Psych-and-Econ group at UC Berkeley,"I thank Adam Szeidl, Matthew Rabin, Nick Barberis, Ulrike Malmendier, Botond Koszegi, Gur Huberman, Tano Santos, Paul Tetlock, Brett Green, Martin Lettau, John Beshears, James Choi, Keith Chen, Max Kasy, Florian Peters, Aniko Oery, Sheng Li, Ana Rocca, Marco Schwarz, Lydia Ashton, Sebastian Ebert, Takeshi Murooka, Victoria Vanasco as well as seminar participants at Wharton, LBS, Columbia GSB, Yale SOM, University of Toronto, Michigan State University, University of Toronto Rotman, UCLA Anderson, USC Marshall, University of Washington Foster, Federal Reserve Board, and other places for their helpful comments and suggestions.

For some parameters, we may be uncertain around the true mean values of the variables, but the ordering of the values is known. Typical sampling approaches lack either statistical or clinical validity. For example, sampling using a common number generator results in extreme dependence, and independent sampling can lead to realisations with incorrect ordering. We propose a new sampling approach for ordered parameters, the difference method (DM) approach, which samples the parameters of interest via a difference parameter. If the parameters of interest are bounded, it involves transforming the variables so that they are unbounded and then sampling via the difference parameter. We have provided a Microsoft Excel workbook to implement the method. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example sampling ordered parameters for utility and cost. The DM approach has a number of advantages when comparing with the typical approaches used in practice. It generates PSA samples that have similar summary statistics as the given values in our examples, while maintaining the constraint that one value was greater than another. The method also implies plausible positive correlation between the two ordered variables. Both clinical and statistical validity should be checked when producing PSA samples. The DM approach should be considered as a solution to potential problems in generating PSA samples for ordered parameters.","[Ren, Shijie; Whyte, Sophie; Latimer, Nicholas R.; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Minton, Jonathan] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow,"Ren, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",s.ren@sheffield.ac.uk,,", Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124",,,,,6,5,5,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,341,347,,10.1007/s40273-017-0584-3,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29081060.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800007,0

These models have important applications in empirical work. The regions are derived from sufficiency conditions in Bougerol (1993) and take a nonstandard form. We show that the nonstandard shape of the sufficiency regions cannot be avoided by reparame-terizing the model or by rescaling the score steps in the transition equation for the correlation parameter. This makes the result markedly different from the volatility case. Observationally equivalent decompositions of the stochastic recurrence equation yield regions with different shapes and sizes. We use these results to establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. We illustrate our results with an analysis of time-varying correlations between U.K. and Greek equity indices.

We analyse real data observed for annuity prices in the German market followed by the examination of the impact of unisex calculation, allowing for different assumed and realised gender compositions. To this end, we develop a realistically calibrated asset and liability model for a PLA with stochastic mortality, interest rates, and equity returns. We show that for males, the disadvantages of PLA's unisex pricing as compared to the gender-specific calculation are substantially lower, if we measure them by considering a lifetime utility that accounts for both distributed surpluses and stochastic mortality. For the insurance company, the gender mix composition turns out to be less important than the capital market influence. Moreover, participating life annuities turn out to be an efficient means to share actual mortality experience between insurance company and the annuitant, and can be, at least to a certain extent, considered a substitute for indemnity longevity hedge.

Adverse selection can prevent profitable round-trip trading strategies that otherwise would arise if permanent price impact were included in the model.","[Kratz, Peter] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Schoneborn, Torsten] Deutsch Bank AG, London, England",Aix-Marseille Universite; Deutsche Bank,"Schöneborn, T (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bank AG, London, England.",schoeneborn@math.tu-berlin.de,,,Deutsche Bank through Quantitative Products Laboratory,Deutsche Bank through Quantitative Products Laboratory,"We wish to thank Swagato Acharjee, Christoph Baumgarten, Ulrich Horst, Sebastian Jaimungal, Werner Kratz, Daniel Nehren, and Mark van Achter for useful comments and discussions.

Previous studies concentrate on improving the finite-sample properties of tests under heteroskedasticity of unknown forms in linear models. The advantage of a heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator (HCCME)-type small-sample improvement for linear models does not carry over to the nonlinear model specifications since there is no obvious counterpart for the diagonal element of the projection matrix in linear models, which is crucial for implementing the finite-sample refinement. Within the framework of nonlinear models, we develop a straightforward approach by extending the applicability of HCCME-type corrections to the two-step GMM method. The Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed method not only refines the testing procedure in terms of the error of rejection probability, but also improves the coefficient estimation based on the mean squared error (MSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). The estimation of a constant elasticity of substitution (CES)-type production function is also provided to illustrate how to implement the proposed method empirically.","[Lin, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Chou, Ta-Sheng] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Business Adm, Chungli, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Lin, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,"National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 99-2410-H-007-022, NSC 102-2410-H-033-005]","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Financial support from the National Science Council of Taiwan in the form of grants NSC 99-2410-H-007-022 (Lin) and NSC 102-2410-H-033-005 (Chou) is greatly appreciated.,,51,3,3,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

As a consequence there is then no concept of a mean return compensating risk exposures, as zero is the only instantaneous risk-free return. From this perspective, all portfolios are subject to risk and there are only bad and better ways of holding risk. For the purpose of analysing portfolios, the univariate variance gamma model is extended to higher dimensions with an arrival rate function with full high-dimensional support and independent levels of marginal skewness and excess kurtosis. Investment objectives are given by concave lower price functionals formulated as measure distorted variations. Specific measure distortions are calibrated to data on S&P 500 index options and the time series of the index. The time series estimation is conducted by digital moment matching applied to uncentred data and it is shown that data centring is a noisy activity to be generally avoided. The evaluation of the instantaneous investment objective requires the computation of measure distorted integrals. This is done using Monte Carlo applied to gamma distributed ellipitical radii with a low shape parameter. The resulting risk reward frontiers are between finite variation as the reward and measure distorted variations as risk. In the absence of an instantaneous risk-free return, portfolios on the efficient frontier are characterized by differences in asset variations being given by differences in asset covariations with the risk charge differential of the efficient portfolio. Portfolio variations seen as the equivalent of excess returns. may optimally be negative. Lower price maximizing portfolios are presented in two, six and twenty five dimensions.","[Madan, Dilip B.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Madan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,,,,,37,10,11,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, the models used in applications make additional assumptions, beyond ambiguity aversion, on the structure of the investor's preferences. Therefore, it is not clear how to disentangle the effect of ambiguity aversion from other features of preferences on equilibrium prices. This paper offers a general theory of asset pricing assuming only ambiguity aversion. Price indeterminacy may result in equilibrium when preferences are not smooth. A set of priors, which is identifiable in all the models used in applications, contains the relevant information to price assets. Ambiguity enriches the standard pricing formula by an additional stochastic discount factor and we calculate its explicit form for various models.","[Pennesi, Daniele] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Pennesi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",daniele.pennesi@unibo.it,,"Pennesi, Daniele/0000-0001-8505-9666",,,,,40,2,2,2,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

In this paper, we investigate the co-movement of return and volatility measures in different commodity futures markets and how these measures are affected by liquidity risk. First, we find that commodity returns display co-movement and that liquidity risk plays a key role in shaping asset return patterns. Moreover, we show that the volatilities of commodity returns co-move, and we demonstrate the role of liquidity risk in this joint pattern. We also find that the commodity markets we investigated share a common volatility factor that determines their joint volatility co-movement. Because liquidity risk affects both commodity returns and volatility shocks, it might be interpreted as the common causal factor driving both measures simultaneously. Therefore, we affirm the view that liquidity shocks are firmly related to two residual risks originating from both market return and market volatility. Finally, we also show that liquidity spillovers can significantly drive cross-sectional correlation dynamics.","[Zhang, Yongmin] Ningbo Univ, Sch Business, 818 Fenghua Rd, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongmin; Ding, Shusheng] Univ Nottingham Ningbo, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, Ctr Global Finance, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Zhang, YM (通讯作者)，Ningbo Univ, Sch Business, 818 Fenghua Rd, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YM (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham Ningbo, Nottingham Univ Business Sch China, Ctr Global Finance, 199 Taikang East Rd, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yminzhang27@163.com,"DING, Aaron/AAH-7066-2019",,Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo Research [2017A610135]; Ningbo-CASS collaborative fund [NZKT201701],Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo Research; Ningbo-CASS collaborative fund,This work is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo Research [grant number 2017A610135] and Ningbo-CASS collaborative fund [grant number NZKT201701].,,40,15,17,4,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The underlying log-price process is contaminated by additive noise, which consists of two orthogonal components to accommodate alpha-mixing dependent exogenous noise and an asymptotically non-degenerate endogenous correlation structure. In the absence of jumps, the class of estimators is shown to be consistent, asymptotically unbiased, and mixed Gaussian at the optimal rate of convergence, n(1/4). Exact bounds on lower-order terms are obtained, and these are used to propose a selection rule for the flat-top shrinkage. Bounds on the optimal bandwidth for noise models of varying complexity are also provided. In theoretical and numerical comparisons with alternative estimators, including the realized kernel, the two-scale realized kernel, and a bias-corrected pre-averaging estimator, the flat-top realized kernel enjoys a higher-order advantage in terms of bias reduction, in addition to good efficiency properties. The analysis is extended to jump-diffusions where the asymptotic properties of a flat-top realized kernel estimate of the total quadratic variation are established. Apart from a larger asymptotic variance, they are similar to the no-jump case. Finally, the estimators are used to design two classes of (medium) blocked realized kernels, which produce consistent, non-negative estimates of integrated variance. The blocked estimators are shown to have no loss either of asymptotic efficiency or in the rate of consistency relative to the flat-top realized kernels when jumps are absent. However, only the medium blocked realized kernels achieve the optimal rate of convergence under the jump alternative.","[Varneskov, Rasmus Tangsgaard] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Varneskov, Rasmus Tangsgaard] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Varneskov, RT (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",rvarneskov@creates.au.dk,,"Varneskov, Rasmus/0000-0002-6533-5608","Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University; CREATES - Danish National Research Foundation","Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University; CREATES - Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","I wish to thank Torben G.

In this context, asset and liability management (ALM) frameworks for pension plan operators are increasingly based on multistage stochastic programming (MSP). The significant advances in MSP modeling notwithstanding, previous works ignore risk-based regulatory constraints such as those in the Solvency II Directive. In this work, we propose an ALM model for open pension schemes based on an MSP model with a thorough representation of a risk based regulation. Our proposal aims to define a dynamic optimal asset allocation including a detailed depiction of bond coupon payments, based on insolvency risk measures over a planning horizon. We present a realistic case study based on the Brazilian market, where the regulator imposes Solvency-II-compatible constraints on credit, underwriting, and operational risks. We develop a computationally tractable MSP model with explicit regulatory constraints, which induce risk aversion for even risk-neutral open pension plan operators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The alternative hypothesis is that the relevant part of the reduced form matrix has proper rank, that is, that the equation is identified. The usual linear model with normal disturbances is invariant with respect to linear transformations of the endogenous and of the exogenous variables. When the disturbance covariance matrix is known, it can be set to the identity, and the invariance of the endogenous variables is with respect to orthogonal transformations. The likelihood ratio test is invariant with respect to these transformations and is the best invariant test. Furthermore it is admissible in the class of all tests. Any other test has lower power and/or higher significance level. In particular, this likelihood ratio test dominates a test based on the Two-Stage Least Squares estimator.","[Anderson, Theodore W.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Anderson, TW (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"London School of Economics and University College, London","London School of Economics and University College, London","The author (deceased, September 17, 2016) thanked Naoto Kunitomo, Graduate School of Economics, University of Tokyo for his generous assistance.

Log-earnings are the sum of a general Markovian persistent component and a transitory innovation. The persistence of past shocks to earnings is allowed to vary according to the size and sign of the current shock. Consumption is modeled as an age-dependent nonlinear function of assets, unobservable tastes, and the two earnings components. We establish the nonparametric identification of the nonlinear earnings process and of the consumption policy rule. Exploiting the enhanced consumption and asset data in recent waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the earnings process features nonlinear persistence and conditional skewness. We confirm these results using population register data from Norway. We then show that the impact of earnings shocks varies substantially across earnings histories, and that this nonlinearity drives heterogeneous consumption responses. The framework provides new empirical measures of partial insurance in which the transmission of income shocks to consumption varies systematically with assets, the level of the shock, and the history of past shocks.","[Arellano, Manuel] CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Blundell, Richard] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Blundell, Richard] Inst Fiscal Studies, 7 Ridgmount St, London WC1E 7AE, England; [Bonhomme, Stephane] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Chicago,"Arellano, M (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain.",arellano@cemfi.es; r.blundell@ucl.ac.uk; sbonhomme@uchicago.edu,"Blundell, Richard William/C-1552-2008; Arellano, Manuel/AAD-8080-2021","Blundell, Richard William/0000-0003-1588-2299;","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2011-26342]; ESRC Centre CPP at IFS; ERC MicroConLab project; European Research Council/ERC [263107]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [263107] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); ESRC Centre CPP at IFS(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ERC MicroConLab project(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This paper was the basis for Arellano's Presidential Address to the Econometric Society in 2014.

This work proposes a new empirical design to investigate the dynamics of quarterly LETFs returns. Rather than relying on fund-by-fund overlapping regressions, as in existing literature, the paper exploits a large panel of non-overlapping data covering the whole universe of Proshares, the US primary LETFs provider. Overall, it is found that the variables prescribed by theory broadly explain cross-sectional variability. It is also found that inverse LETFs and more generally, leveraged funds operating in asset classes like international equity, bonds and commodities underperform theoretical predictions. This underperformance is mainly attributed to frictions in the process of implementing the required daily leverage.","[Giannetti, Antoine] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Finance Dept, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Giannetti, A (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Finance Dept, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",giannett@fau.edu,,,,,,,23,4,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

By aggregating lives covered under their many individual contracts with payers, PBMs have formidable negotiating power. They influence pharmaceutical insurance coverage, design the terms of coverage in a plan's drug benefit, and create competition among providers for inclusion in a plan's network. PBMs have, through intermediation, the potential to secure lower drug prices and to improve rational prescribing. Whether these potential outcomes are realized within the relevant budget is a function of the healthcare system and the interaction of benefit design and clinical processes-not just individually vetted components. Efficiencies and values achieved in price discounts and cost sharing can be nullified if there is irrational prescribing (over-utilization, under-utilization and mis-utilization), variable patient adherence to medication regimens, ineffective formulary processes, or fraud, waste and abuse. Rising prescription drug costs and the increasing prevalence of 'high deductible health plans', which require much greater patient out-of-pocket costs, is creating a crisis for PBM efforts towards an affordable pharmacy benefit. Since PBM rebate and incentive contracts are opaque to the public, whether they add value by restraining higher drug prices or benefit from them is debatable.","[Lyles, Alan] Univ Baltimore, Coll Publ Affairs, Govt Business & Nonprofit Partnerships, 1420 North Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Baltimore,"Lyles, A (通讯作者)，Univ Baltimore, Coll Publ Affairs, Govt Business & Nonprofit Partnerships, 1420 North Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",calyles@ubalt.edu,,,,,,,38,12,16,0,19,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2017,35.0,5,,,,,493,500,,10.1007/s40273-017-0489-1,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER9SS,28210864.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399167600001,0

We study the Nash equilibria of the resulting game of transfers. We show that equilibria maximize a concave potential function. We establish existence, uniqueness of equilibrium consumption, and generic uniqueness of equilibrium transfers. We characterize the geometry of the network of transfers and highlight the key role played by transfer intermediaries. We then study comparative statics. A positive income shock to an individual benefits all. For small changes in incomes, agents in a component of the network of transfers act as if they were organized in an income-pooling community.

It places emphasis on personal and social responsibility of managers for enterprise development. The Balanced Scorecard system increases transparency of these goals, personal responsibility for the strategy, and it causes the growth of competitiveness and expansion of the enterprise. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) defines financial and non-financial goals and indicators, which serve for measurement of performance and - after all - the successfulness of the enterprise. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is a model, which measures the efficiency by means of the rate of expended inputs to the produced outputs. The goal of this paper is to compare the technical efficiency of 13 insurance companies in Czech Republic with help of the non-parametric approach DEA, specially the input-oriented model with the use of Balanced Scorecard frame. Outputs of the paper will be determined by BSC indicators in the sphere of insurance industry and then will be compared with the technical efficiency by using DEA approach.

Risk transfer solutions are not yet fully developed, and when available they are expensive. A significant part of the risk must therefore be retained by the life insurer. So far, most of the research work on longevity risk has been mainly concerned with capital requirements and specific risk transfer solutions. However, the impact of longevity risk on shareholder value also deserves attention. While it is commonly accepted that a market-consistent valuation should be performed in this respect, the definition of a fair shareholder value for a life insurance business is not trivial. In this paper, we develop a multi-period market-consistent shareholder value model for a life annuity business. The model allows for systematic and idiosyncratic longevity risk and includes the most significant variables affecting shareholder value: the cost of capital (which in a market-consistent setting must be quantified in terms of frictional and agency costs, net of the value of the limited liability put option), policyholder demand elasticity and the cost of alternative longevity risk management solutions, namely indemnity-based and index-based solutions. We show how the model can be used for assessing the impact of different longevity risk management strategies on life insurer shareholder value and solvency.","[Blackburn, Craig; Hanewald, Katja; Sherris, Michael] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Olivieri, Annamaria] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Econ, Via Kennedy 6, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Sherris, Michael] Univ New South Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Parma; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hanewald, K (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",c.blackburn@unsw.edu.au; k.hanewald@unsw.edu.au; annamaria.olivieri@unipr.it; m.sherris@unsw.edu.au,"Sherris, Michael/E-6235-2010; Olivieri, Annamaria/AAJ-2613-2021","Olivieri, Annamaria/0000-0002-8461-3634; Hanewald, Katja/0000-0001-9932-2840",ARC Linkage Grant Project [LP0883398]; World Bank; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR) [CE110001029]; Italian MUR; PwC; APRA; Australian Research Council [LP0883398] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,"ARC Linkage Grant Project(Australian Research Council); World Bank(The World Bank India); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR)(Australian Research Council); Italian MUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); PwC; APRA; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of ARC Linkage Grant Project LP0883398 Managing Risk with Insurance and Superannuation as Individuals Age with industry partners PwC, APRA and the World Bank as well as the support of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR) (project number CE110001029).

In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of a recent, high-quality data set from a large electronic trading platform that utilizes QCLOBs to facilitate trade. We argue that the quote-relative framework often used to study other LOBs is not a sensible reference frame for QCLOBs, so we instead introduce an alternative, trade-relative framework, which we use to study the statistical properties of order flow and LOB state in our data. We also uncover an empirical universality: although the distributions that describe order flow and LOB state vary considerably across days, a simple, linear rescaling causes them to collapse onto a single curve. Motivated by this finding, we propose a semi-parametric model of order flow and LOB state for a single trading day. Our model provides similar performance to that of parametric curve-fitting techniques but is simpler to compute and faster to implement.","[Gould, Martin D.] Imperial Coll, CFM Imperial Inst Quantitat Finance, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Porter, Mason A.; Howison, Sam D.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Porter, Mason A.] Univ Oxford, CABDyN Complex Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Porter, Mason A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Math, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Howison, Sam D.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst Quantitat Finance, Oxford OX2 6ED, England",Imperial College London; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Oxford,"Gould, MD (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, CFM Imperial Inst Quantitat Finance, London SW7 2AZ, England.",gouldm@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Howison, Sam/JMP-9887-2023",,Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; EPSRC [08001834]; James S.

Sometimes this information is not available but non-utility measures of quality of life may have been collected from which the required utilities can be estimated. This paper examines the possibility of mapping a non-utility-based outcome, the Sydney Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ-S), onto five multi-attribute utility instruments: Assessment of Quality of Life 8 Dimensions (AQoL-8D), EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), 15 Dimensions (15D), and the Short-Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D). Data for 856 individuals with asthma were obtained from a large Multi-Instrument Comparison (MIC) survey. Four statistical techniques were employed to estimate utilities from the AQLQ-S. The predictive accuracy of 180 regression models was assessed using six criteria: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation, distribution of predicted utilities, distribution of residuals, and proportion of predictions with absolute errors < 0.0.5. Validation of initial 'primary' models was carried out on a random sample of the MIC data. Best results were obtained with non-linear models that included a quadratic term for the AQLQ-S score along with demographic variables. The four statistical techniques predicted models that performed differently when assessed by the six criteria; however, the best results, for both the estimation and validation samples, were obtained using a generalised linear model (GLM estimator). It is possible to predict valid utilities from the AQLQ-S using regression methods. We recommend GLM models for this exercise.","[Kaambwa, Billingsley; Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, A Block,202-16 Daws Rd,Daw Pk, Adelaide, SA 5041, Australia; [Chen, Gang; Iezzi, Angelo; Maxwell, Aimee; Richardson, Jeff] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Bldg 75,15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Monash University,"Kaambwa, B (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, A Block,202-16 Daws Rd,Daw Pk, Adelaide, SA 5041, Australia.",billingsley.kaambwa@flinders.edu.au,"Maxwell, Aimee/JAC-6426-2023; Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Maxwell, Aimee/0000-0003-4328-144X; Richardson, Jeff/0000-0002-4248-4280; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965; KAAMBWA, BILLINGSLEY/0000-0002-2128-3404; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [1006334],Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),This work was supported through an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) project Grant (Grant Number 1006334).,,78,18,18,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2017,35.0,1,,,,,111,124,,10.1007/s40273-016-0446-4,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EI1JA,27557995.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392231900009,0

However, in some practical cases, for example, due to the absence of historical data, the inherent uncertain characteristic of risks or different subject judgements from the decision-makers, risks may be hard or not appropriate to be estimated with probability distributions. Therefore, the traditional probabilistic risk aversion theory is ineffective. Thus, in order to deal with these cases, we suggest measuring these kinds of risks as fuzzy variables, and accordingly to present an alternative risk aversion approach by employing credibility theory. In the present paper, first, the definition of credibilistic risk premium proposed by Georgescu and Kinnunen [Fuzzy Inf. Eng., 2013, 5, 399-416] is revised by taking the initial wealth into consideration, and then a general method to compute the credibilistic risk premium is provided. Secondly, regarding the risks represented with the commonly used LR fuzzy intervals, a simple calculation formula of the local credibilistic risk premium is put forward. Finally, in a global sense, several equivalent propositions for comparative risk aversion under the credibility measurement are provided. Illustrated examples are presented to show the applicability of the theoretical findings.","[Liu, Yuanyuan; Zhou, Jian] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200044, Peoples R China; [Pantelous, Athanasios A.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZL, Merseyside, England; [Pantelous, Athanasios A.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool L69 7ZL, Merseyside, England",Shanghai University; University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200044, Peoples R China.",zhou_jian@shu.edu.cn,"liu, yuanyuan/GWZ-5838-2022; liu, yuanyuan/IQS-2755-2023; liu, 园园/HJI-4438-2023; liu, yuanyuan/HSG-8372-2023; Zhou, Jian/JXM-3929-2024; Pantelous, Athanasios/B-3721-2014","Zhou, Jian/0000-0001-7835-8879; Pantelous, Athanasios/0000-0001-5738-1471",'Shuguang Program' from Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [15SG36]; Recruitment Program of High-end Foreign Experts [GDW2016 3100009]; EPSRC; ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training on Quantification and Management of Risk & Uncertainty in Complex Systems Environments [EP/L015927/1],'Shuguang Program' from Shanghai Education Development Foundation; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (SHMEC)); Recruitment Program of High-end Foreign Experts; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training on Quantification and Management of Risk & Uncertainty in Complex Systems Environments,"The work is supported by 'Shuguang Program' from Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [grant number 15SG36], and the Recruitment Program of High-end Foreign Experts [grant number GDW2016 3100009].

However, this research is going to show how differentiation and competitive innovation strategy could affect the organizational performance, not only financially but also non-financially.","[Mitroulis, Dimitrios; Kitsios, Fotis] Univ Macedonia, Sch Informat Sci, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Mitroulis, D (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Sch Informat Sci, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece.",tm1133@uom.edu.gr; kitsios@uom.gr,"Kitsios, Fotis C./B-2286-2017","Kitsios, Fotis C./0000-0001-7269-5567; Mitroulis, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0830-3674",,,,,122,1,1,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-33003-7; 978-3-319-33001-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,85,112,,10.1007/978-3-319-33003-7_5,0.0,,,28,"Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BI0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405341000005,0

In compression, market participants share trade information via a third-party company, which then proposes a set of trades which will use multilateral netting to reduce counterparty exposures. In this paper, we propose and analyse a set of multilateral netting algorithms based on exposure minimization. As we assume fungibility, these methods are appropriate for derivative markets with wide-scale product standardization. We find that these compression algorithms all perform extremely well across a range of criteria and we discuss their relative attributes. We strongly favour compressions based on the -norm as we find that they eliminate a high fraction of bilateral connections and retain the greatest common divisor of existing positions. We argue that multilateral netting is an effective counterparty risk mitigation technique in OTC derivative markets if done optimally, and the benefits increase with the number of participants.","[O'Kane, Dominic] EDHEC Risk Inst, 393-400 Promenade des Anglais, Nice 3, France",Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"O'Kane, D (通讯作者)，EDHEC Risk Inst, 393-400 Promenade des Anglais, Nice 3, France.",dominic.okane@edhec-risk.com,,,French Banking Federation (FBF) Chair on Banking regulation and innovation under the aegis of the Louis Bachelier laboratory; Foundation Institut Europlace de Finance (IEF); EDHEC,French Banking Federation (FBF) Chair on Banking regulation and innovation under the aegis of the Louis Bachelier laboratory; Foundation Institut Europlace de Finance (IEF); EDHEC,This research benefited from the support of the French Banking Federation (FBF) Chair on Banking regulation and innovation under the aegis of the Louis Bachelier laboratory in collaboration with the Foundation Institut Europlace de Finance (IEF) and EDHEC.,,16,5,5,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The log-vMEM improves on existing models in two ways. First, it is a more general form model as it allows the error terms to be cross-dependent and relaxes weak exogeneity restrictions. Second, the log-vMEM specification guarantees that the conditional means are non-negative without any restrictions imposed on the parameters. We further propose a multivariate lognormal distribution and a joint maximum likelihood estimation strategy. The model is applied to high frequency data associated with a number of NYSE-listed stocks. The results reveal empirical support for full interdependence of trading duration, volume and volatility, with the log-vMEM providing a better fit to the data than a competing model. Moreover, we find that unexpected duration and volume dominate observed duration and volume in terms of information content, and that volatility and volatility shocks affect duration in different directions. These results are interpreted with reference to extant microstructure theory.","[Taylor, N.] Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Xu, Y.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 1EU, S Glam, Wales",University of Bristol; Cardiff University,"Taylor, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",nick.taylor@bristol.ac.uk,,"Xu, Yondeng/0000-0001-8275-1585",,,,,35,6,6,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In this paper, we tackle the open problem of deriving upper bounds for strictly concave distortion risk measures on moment spaces. Building on early results of Rustagi (1957, 1976), we show that in general this problem can be reduced to a parametric optimization problem. We completely specify the sharp upper bound (and corresponding maximizing distribution function) when the first moment and any other higher moment are fixed. Specifically, in the case of a fixed mean and variance, we generalize the Cantelli bound for (Tail) Value-at-Risk in that we express the sharp upper bound for a strictly concave distorted expectation as a weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation.

The scarcity of knowledge about the probability of an elderly person needing help with activities of daily living has hindered the development of insurance solutions that complement existing social systems. In this paper, we consider two models: a frailty level model that studies the evolution of a dependent person through mild, moderate and severe dependency states to death and a type of care model that distinguishes between care received at home and care received in an institution. We develop and interpret the expressions for the state- and time-dependent transition probabilities in a semi-Markov framework. Then, we empirically assess these probabilities using a novel longitudinal dataset covering all LTC needs in Switzerland over a 20-year period. As a key result, we are the first to derive dependence probability tables by acuity level, gender and age for the Swiss population. We find that the transition probabilities differ significantly by gender, age and time spent in the frailty level and type of care states. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, sharp convergence rates of this method for realistic financial payoffs, which are nonsmooth, are rarely available. In this paper, we solve this problem for general one-dimensional diffusion models, which play a fundamental role in financial applications. For such models, the Markov chain approximation method is equivalent to the method of lines using the central difference. Our analysis is based on the spectral representation of the exact solution and the approximate solution. By establishing the convergence rate for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions, we obtain sharp convergence rates for the transition density and the price of options with nonsmooth payoffs. In particular, we show that for call-/put-type payoffs, convergence is second order, while for digital-type payoffs, convergence is generally only first order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification for two well-known smoothing techniques that can restore second-order convergence for digital-type payoffs and explain oscillations observed in the convergence for options with nonsmooth payoffs.

It is assumed that accidents occur according to a Poisson point process, and each accident is accompanied by a claim developmental mark that contains the reporting time, the settlement time, and the size of (possibly multiple) payments between these two times. Under exponential reporting and settlement delays, we show that our model can be represented as a Markovian risk process with countably infinite number of states. This can in turn be transformed to an equivalent fluid flow model when the payments are phase-type distributed. As a result, classical measures such as ruin probability or more generally the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function follow directly. The joint Laplace transform and the pairwise joint moments involving the ruin time and the aggregate payments of different types (with and without claim settlement) are further derived. Numerical illustrations are given at the end, including the use of a real insurance dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although previous studies on causes of death focused on mortality indicators such as survival curves or life expectancy, our approach provides additional information by including birth patterns. As an important conclusion, our numerical results based on French data show that populations with identical life expectancies can present important differences in their age pyramid resulting from different cause-specific mortality reductions.

Since we work with simulated data, we are able to measure the performance of model selection by the success rate of the IC in selecting the model that was used to generate the data. In particular, we are interested in the relation between correct model selection and underlying sample size.

Based on observations of the spread, this paper provides recursive estimates for both the state of the market and all coefficients in the model.","[Elliott, Robert J.; Bradrania, Reza] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Elliott, Robert J.] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of South Australia; University of Calgary,"Elliott, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Elliott, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB, Canada.",relliott@ucalgary.ca,"; Bradrania, Reza/O-1609-2015","Elliott, Robert/0000-0002-5486-6999; Bradrania, Reza/0000-0003-4495-8408",SSHRC; Australian Research Council,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the SSHRC and the Australian Research Council.,,11,6,7,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

It deals with the estimation of parameters that characterize the nodes of a tree structure. That model is limited, however, by the fact that its parameters are assumed fixed over time. This causes the model's parameter estimates to track the parameters poorly when the latter are subject to variation over time. This paper seeks to remove this limitation by assuming the parameters in question to follow a process akin to a random walk over time, producing an evolutionary hierarchical model. The specific form of the model is compatible with the use of the Kalman filter for parameter estimation and forecasting. The application of the Kalman filter is conceptually straightforward, but the tree structure of the model parameters can be extensive, and some effort is required to retain organization of the updating algorithm. This is achieved by suitable manipulation of the graph associated with the tree. The graph matrix then appears in the matrix calculations inherent in the Kalman filter. A numerical example is included to illustrate the application of the filter to the model.","[Taylor, Greg] UNSW Business Sch, Level 6,East Lobby,UNSW Business Sch Bldg E12, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Taylor, G (通讯作者)，UNSW Business Sch, Level 6,East Lobby,UNSW Business Sch Bldg E12, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",gregory.taylor@unsw.edu.au,,,Australian Actuaries Institute; Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme [LP130100723],Australian Actuaries Institute; Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme(Australian Research Council),The principal financial support for this research was provided by a grant from the Australian Actuaries Institute.

We establish that the problem of recovering the probability density function (pdf) of random parameters falls into the class of convexly-constrained inverse problems. The framework offers an estimation method that separates computational solution of the structural model from estimation. We first discuss nonparametric identification. Then, we propose two alternative estimation procedures to estimate the density and derive their asymptotic properties. Our general framework allows us to deal with unobservable nuisance variables, e.g., measurement error, but also covers the case when there are no such nuisance variables.

This article provides an overview of the role and the development of CSPBMs, and presents a description of existing CSPBMs in the literature. The article also provides an overview of the psychometric properties of CSPBMs in comparison with generic preference-based measures (generic PBMs), and considers the advantages and disadvantages of CSPBMs in comparison with generic PBMs. CSPBMs typically include dimensions that are important for that condition but may not be important across all patient groups. There are a large number of CSPBMs across a wide range of conditions, and these vary from covering a wide range of dimensions to more symptomatic or uni-dimensional measures. Psychometric evidence is limited but suggests that CSPBMs offer an advantage in more accurate measurement of milder health states. The mean change and standard deviation can differ for CSPBMs and generic PBMs, and this may impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CSPBMs have a useful role in HTA where a generic PBM is not appropriate, sensitive or responsive. However, due to issues of comparability across different patient groups and interventions, their usage in health technology assessment is often limited to conditions where it is inappropriate to use a generic PBM or sensitivity analyses.","[Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John; Ara, Roberta] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Zouraq, Ismail Azzabi] Takeda Pharmaceut Int AG, Thurgauerstr 130, CH-8152 Glattpark Opfikon, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Sheffield; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk; Ismail.Azzabi-Zouraq@takeda.com,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,65,54,55,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S33,S41,,10.1007/s40273-017-0546-9,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052164.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400006,0

In particular, we consider an endowment insurance contract, that is a combination of a term insurance policy and a pure endowment, whose final value depends on the trend of a stock market where the premia the policyholder pays are invested. To allow for mutual dependence between the financial and the insurance markets, we use the progressive enlargement of filtration approach. We assume that the stock price process dynamics depends on an exogenous unobservable stochastic factor that also influences the mortality rate of the policyholder. We characterize the optimal hedging strategy in terms of the integrand in the Galtchouk Kunita Watanabe decomposition of the insurance claim with respect to the minimal martingale measure and the available information flow. We provide an explicit formula by means of predictable projection of the corresponding hedging strategy under full information with respect to the natural filtration of the risky asset price and the minimal martingale measure.

We use a flexible semi-parametric distribution for the unobserved heterogeneities to allow for either positive or negative spurious risk dependence. We find that the effect of losing one's spouse is asymmetric for the two sexes. Moreover, although the broken-heart syndrome explains a large portion of the dependency, there is evidence of positive spurious risk dependence. These findings have important implications for the pricing of joint insurance products. Failure to take into account either of these two effects leads to pricing error that can be either positive or negative, depending on the characteristics of the couple.","[Lu, Yang] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13001 Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Lu, Y (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13001 Marseille, France.",luyang000278@gmail.com,"Lu, Yang/O-3500-2018","Lu, Yang/0000-0002-7141-1048",,,,,42,10,11,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2017,47.0,3,,,,,837,874,,10.1017/asb.2017.8,0.0,,,38,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FE9ZW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408563000007,0

This paper fills one of the gaps by deriving weak diffusion limits of a modified version of the classical DCC model. The limiting system of stochastic differential equations is characterized by a diffusion matrix of reduced rank. The degeneracy is due to perfect collinearity between the innovations of the volatility and correlation dynamics. For the special case of constant conditional correlations, a nondegenerate diffusion limit can be obtained. Alternative sets of conditions are considered for the rate of convergence of the parameters, obtaining time-varying but deterministic variances and/or correlations. A Monte Carlo experiment confirms that the often used quasi-approximate maximum likelihood (QAML) method to estimate the diffusion parameters is inconsistent for any fixed frequency, but that it may provide reasonable approximations for sufficiently large frequencies and sample sizes.","[Hafner, Christian M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Laurent, Sebastien] aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Violante, Francesco] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Universite Catholique Louvain; Aix-Marseille Universite; Aarhus University,"Hafner, CM (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, ISBA, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Hafner, CM (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",Christian.hafner@uclouvain.be,"Violante, Francesco/AAW-8560-2020; Laurent, Sebastien/AAT-1573-2020","Laurent, Sebastien/0000-0002-4148-756X; Violante, Francesco/0000-0002-1529-0843",project Equip@Meso of the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-10-EQPX-29-01],project Equip@Meso of the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was granted access to the HPC resources of Aix-Marseille Universite financed by the project Equip@Meso (ANR-10-EQPX-29-01) of the program Investissements d'Avenir supervised by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche.,,42,4,4,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We show that a mechanism is optimal if and only if a measure derived from the buyer's type distribution satisfies certain stochastic dominance conditions. This measure expresses the marginal change in the seller's revenue under marginal changes in the rent paid to subsets of buyer types. As a corollary, we characterize the optimality of grand-bundling mechanisms, strengthening several results in the literature, where only sufficient optimality conditions have been derived. As an application, we show that the optimal mechanism for n independent uniform items each supported on [c,c+1] is a grand-bundling mechanism, as long as c is sufficiently large, extending Pavlov's result for two items Pavlov, 2011. At the same time, our characterization also implies that, for all c and for all sufficiently large n, the optimal mechanism for n independent uniform items supported on [c,c+1] is not a grand-bundling mechanism.","[Daskalakis, Constantinos; Tzamos, Christos] MIT, EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Deckelbaum, Alan] MIT, Math, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Daskalakis, C (通讯作者)，MIT, EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",costis@csail.mit.edu; deckel@alum.mit.edu; tzamos@mit.edu,,"Tzamos, Christos/0000-0002-7560-5069","Sloan Foundation Fellowship; Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship; NSF [CCF-0953960, CCF-1101491]; Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Daniel Stroock Fellowship; Simons Award for Graduate Students in TCS; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1650733] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Sloan Foundation Fellowship(Alfred P.

However, choosing the 'right' copula is not an easy task, and the temptation to prefer a tractable rather than a meaningful candidate from the encompassing copulas toolbox is strong. The ubiquitous applications of the Gaussian copula are just one illuminating example. Speaking generally, a 'good' copula should conform to the problem at hand, allow for asymmetry in the domain of definition and exhibit some extent of tail dependence. In this paper we introduce and study a new class of Multiple Risk Factor (MRF) copula functions, which we show are exactly such. Namely, the MRF copulas (1) arise from a number of meaningful default risk specifications with stochastic default barriers, (2) are in general non-exchangeable and (3) possess a variety of tail dependences. That being said, the MRF copulas turn out to be surprisingly tractable analytically. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The problem is a nonstandard mixed discrete/continuous optimal control problem, which we solve by a dynamic programming approach. When the utility has a general form, we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and characterize the optimal allocation in the illiquid asset. In the case of power utility, we establish the regularity of the value function needed to prove the verification theorem, providing the complete theoretical solution of the problem.

Methods A Markov cycle tree tracked FN events during chemotherapy (3-week cycles) and long-term survival (1-year cycles). Model inputs, including the efficacy of each strategy, risk of reduced relative dose intensity (RDI), and the impact of RDI on mortality, utilities, and costs (in a,notsign; 2014 values) were estimated from public sources and the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were assessed for each strategy for costs per FN event avoided, life-year (LY) saved, and quality-adjusted LY (QALY) saved. LYs and QALYs saved were discounted at 1.5% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSAs and PSAs) were conducted. Results Base-case ICERs for PP with pegfilgrastim relative to SP with pegfilgrastim were a,notsign15,500 per QALY and a,notsign14,800 per LY saved for stage II breast cancer and a,notsign7800 per QALY and a,notsign6900 per LY saved for NHL; other comparators were either more expensive and less effective than PP or SP with pegfilgrastim or had lower costs but higher ICERs (relative to SP with pegfilgrastim) than PP with pegfilgrastim. Results of the DSA for breast cancer and NHL comparing PP and SP with pegfilgrastim indicate that the model results were most sensitive to the cycle 1 risk of FN, the proportion of FN events requiring hospitalization, the relative risk of FN in cycles >= 2 versus cycle 1, no history of FN, and the mortality hazard ratio for RDI (< 90% vs >= 90% [for NHL]). In the PSAs for stage II breast cancer and NHL, the probabilities that PP with pegfilgrastim was cost effective or dominant versus all other prophylaxis strategies at a a,notsign30,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold were 52% (other strategies <= 24%) and 58% (other strategies <= 24%), respectively. Conclusion From a Belgian payer perspective, PP with pegfilgrastim appears cost effective compared to other prophylaxis strategies in patients with stage II breast cancer or NHL at a a,notsign30,000/QALY threshold.","[Fust, Kelly; Parthan, Anju] Optum, 950 Winter St, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Li, Xiaoyan; Barron, Richard] Amgen Inc, One Amgen Ctr Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Maschio, Michael] Optum, 5500 North Serv Rd,Suite 501, Burlington, ON L7L 6W6, Canada; [Villa, Guillermo] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, Zug, Switzerland; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, 718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Somers, Luc] OncoLogX Bvba, Arthur Boelstr 66, B-2990 Antwerp, Belgium; [Hoefkens, Caroline] Amgen Belgium SA, Ave Ariane 5, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Lyman, Gary H.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA",Optum; Amgen; Optum; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

We propose a continuous time fractionally integrated Wishart stochastic volatility (FIWSV) process, and derive the conditional Laplace transform of the FIWSV model in order to obtain a closed form expression of moments. A two-step procedure is used, namely estimating the parameter of fractional integration via the local Whittle estimator in the first step, and estimating the remaining parameters via the generalized method of moments in the second step. Monte Carlo results for the procedure show a reasonable performance in finite samples. The empirical results for the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indexes show that the data favor the new FIWSV process rather than the one-factor and two-factor models of the Wishart autoregressive process for the covariance structure.","[Asai, Manabu] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, 1-236 Tangi Cho, Hachioji, Tokyo 1928577, Japan; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid, Spain",Soka University; National Tsing Hua University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute; Complutense University of Madrid,"Asai, M (通讯作者)，Soka Univ, Fac Econ, 1-236 Tangi Cho, Hachioji, Tokyo 1928577, Japan.",m-asai@soka.ac.jp,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Asai, Manabu/D-3044-2011","Asai, Manabu/0000-0002-6682-4622","Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JSPS KAKENHI JP25380271]; Australian Academy of Science; Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Taiwan","Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Australian Academy of Science; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The first author acknowledges the financial support of the Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI JP25380271), and Australian Academy of Science.

We first discover the monolinearity of distorted utility, which means that after properly changing the underlying probability measure, distorted utility becomes locally linear in probabilities, and the derivative of distorted utility is simply an expectation of the sample path derivative under the new measure. From the monolinearity property, simulation algorithms for estimating the derivative of distorted utility can be developed, leading to gradient-based search algorithms for the optimum of distorted utility. We then apply the sensitivity-based approach to the portfolio selection problem under distorted utility with complete and incomplete markets. For the complete markets case, the first-order condition is derived and optimal wealth deduced. For the incomplete markets case, a dual characterization of optimal policies is provided; a solvable incomplete market example with unhedgeable interest rate risk is also presented. We expect this sensitivity-based approach to be generally applicable to optimization problems involving probability distortions.","[Cao, Xi-Ren; Wan, Xiangwei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xi-Ren] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xi-Ren] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Adv Study, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Wan, XW (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",xwwan@sjtu.edu.cn,"Wan, Xiangwei/AFE-0229-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61221003]; Collaborative Research Fund of the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [HKUST11/CRF/10]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [12PJC063]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401103]; Shanghai Jiao Tong University","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Collaborative Research Fund of the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Jiao Tong University","The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees, the associate editor, and Prof. Jerome Detemple, the editor, for their valuable comments.

The policy premiums are invested in a reference portfolio that is modeled by means of a regime switching Levy process where the model parameters depend on a continuous time, finite state Markov chain. Thereby, we can take into account persistent changes in the underlying (macro)economic conditions of financial markets and depart from the unsatisfactory assumption of stationary and independent increments in Levy models. While Levy models turn out to be satisfactory for the valuation of short-term financial contracts, the inclusion of macroeconomic changes is a relevant risk driver for (long-term) insurance contracts. This article demonstrates that a second advantage of regime switching Levy models is their mathematical tractability: In contrast to a large part of the related literature, the results in this article do not rely on simulation but are easy-to-implement and closed-form expressions based on (fast) Fourier techniques. A numerical example demonstrates the impact of regime switching on the fair value of cliquet-style return guarantees. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Product assortment planning involves listing decisions based on consumer behavior and substitution effects. Shelf space allocation involves facing and replenishment decisions based on space elasticity effects and constraints of limited shelf space and restocking capacity. The complexity of these questions has grown significantly in recent years due to product proliferation and various consumer choice effects in the retail environment. It is an increasingly difficult task for category managers to find an effective assortment due to consumer preferences instability and the extremely large number of possible assortments. This chapter presents an updated review on scientific models that deal with assortment and shelf space planning and other related topics, such as consumer response to stock-outs and consumer perceptions of assortment variety. One of the main objectives of this literature review is to show that shelf space allocation models do not clearly and comprehensively address assortment selection, neglect substitution effects between products, and ignore the stochastic nature of demand. Assortment planning models on the other hand mostly ignore shelf space constraints and neglect space depend demand.","[Karampatsa, Marina; Grigoroudis, Evangelos; Matsatsinis, Nikolaos F.] Tech Univ Crete, Decis Support Syst Lab, Khania, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Grigoroudis, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Crete, Decis Support Syst Lab, Khania, Greece.",mkarabatsa@isc.tuc.gr; vangelis@ergasya.tuc.gr; nikos@ergasya.tuc.gr,"Matsatsinis, Nikolaos F/Q-8291-2016; Grigoroudis, Evangelos/D-7716-2013","Grigoroudis, Evangelos/0000-0001-8613-9350",,,,,92,9,13,0,22,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-33003-7; 978-3-319-33001-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,35,67,,10.1007/978-3-319-33003-7_3,0.0,,,33,"Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BI0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405341000003,0

The existing literature relies on Monte Carlo simulations, which are not fast enough to be used in a market-making environment. This is because issuers need to compute thousands of price updates per second. By valuing leveraged certificates as multi-window barrier options, we explicitly model random jumps that occur at known times, such as between the exchange closing and re-opening. Our algorithm combines the one-day transition probability with Simpson's numerical integration rule. This yields a backward induction scheme which requires a significantly coarser spatial and time grid than finite-difference methods. We confirm its robustness and accuracy through Monte Carlo simulations.","[Zhang, Ally Quan] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Zhang, Ally Quan] Univ Zurich, Inst Banking & Finance, Plattenstr 32, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Thul, Matthias] Commerzbank AG, Equ Derivat Flow Trading, Equ Mkt & Commod, Mainzer Landstr 153, D-60327 Frankfurt, Germany",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Zurich; Commerzbank AG,"Zhang, AQ (通讯作者)，Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.;Zhang, AQ (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Banking & Finance, Plattenstr 32, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",quan.zhang@bf.uzh.ch,,,Swiss Finance Institute,Swiss Finance Institute,"We thank David Colwell, David Feldman, Felix Kubler, Detlef Mages, participants at the 9th World Congress of the Bachelier Finance Society as well as one anonymous reviewer for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Patiromer is a novel agent used to treat hyperkalemia and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated. The potential clinical outcomes and economic value of using patiromer and spironolactone in patients with HF unable to otherwise tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia are unclear. The objective of this analysis was to model the potential pharmacoeconomic value of using patiromer and spironolactone in patients with a history of hyperkalemia that prevents them from utilizing spironolactone.MethodsWe performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with patiromer, spironolactone, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV HF compared with ACEI alone. A Markov model was constructed to simulate a cohort of 65-year-old patients diagnosed with HF from the payer perspective across the lifetime horizon. Clinical inputs were derived from the RALES and OPAL-HK randomized trials of spironolactone and patiromer, respectively. Utility estimates and costs were derived from the literature and list prices. Outcomes assessed included hospitalization, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probability sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model findings.ResultsTreatment with patiromer-spironolactone-ACEI was projected to increase longevity compared with ACEI alone (5.29 vs. 4.62 life-years gained, respectively), greater QALYs (2.79 vs. 2.60), and costs (US$28,200 vs. US$18,200), giving an ICER of US$52,700 per QALY gained. The ICERs ranged from US$40,000 to US$85,800 per QALY gained in 1-way sensitivity analyses.ConclusionOur results suggest that the use of spironolactone-patiromer-ACEI may provide clinical benefit and good economic value in patients with NYHA class III-IV HF unable to tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia.","[Bounthavong, Mark; Veenstra, David L.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific St,HSB H375-P,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Butler, Javed] SUNY Stony Brook, Div Cardiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dolan, Chantal M.; Fisher, Kathryn A.] CMD Consulting, Sandy, UT USA; [Dunn, Jeffrey D.] Magellan Rx, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Oestreicher, Nina] Relypsa Inc, Epidemiol HEOR & Observat Res, Redwood City, CA USA; [Oestreicher, Nina] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Clin Pharm, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Pitt, Bertram] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hauptman, Paul J.] St Louis Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, St Louis, MO 63104 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Saint Louis University,"Veenstra, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific St,HSB H375-P,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",veenstra@uw.edu,,,"Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group Company","Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group Company","Funded by Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group Company.",,37,13,14,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12,,,,,1463,1473,,10.1007/s40273-018-0709-3,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30194623.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451183300007,0

Our approach to volatility management is univariate, in contrast to most of the existing approaches in the literature that are multivariate and more complex. Of particular relevance to pension funds is that we show substantial risk adjusted outperformance (in the range of an additional 100 to 350 basis points on average) relative to stock market index benchmarks, after transaction costs. Other features of the targeted constant volatility portfolios, relevant to insurers and pension funds, are a significantly reduced exposure to stock market crashes and low transaction costs relative to other approaches.

We show that a similar relationship between potential refutability of a model and existence of more efficient estimators is present in much broader settings. Specifically, a condition we name local overidentification is shown to be equivalent to both the existence of specification tests with nontrivial local power and the existence of more efficient estimators of some smooth parameters in general semi/nonparametric models. Under our notion of local overidentification, various locally nontrivial specification tests such as Hausman tests, incremental Sargan tests (or optimally weighted quasi likelihood ratio tests) naturally extend to general semi/nonparametric settings. We further obtain simple characterizations of local overidentification for general models of nonparametric conditional moment restrictions with possibly different conditioning sets. The results are applied to determining when semi/non-parametric models with endogeneity are locally testable, and when nonparametric plug-in and semiparametric two-step GMM estimators are semiparametrically efficient.

Although the efficacy of these therapies has been shown in recent studies, cost-effectiveness has not yet been determined in Japan. Objective This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of second-line endocrine therapies for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR + and HER2 - mBC. Methods A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the therapies over a 15-year time horizon from a public healthcare payer's perspective. The efficacy and utility parameters were determined via a systematic search of the literature. Direct medical care costs were used. A discount rate of 2% was applied for costs and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed for non-visceral metastasis. A series of sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and threshold analysis were performed. Results Base-case analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 3 million and 6 million Japanese yen (JPY)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for TOR and FUL 500 mg relative to EXE, respectively. FUL 250 mg and EXE + EVE were dominated. The overall survival (OS) highly influenced the ICER. With a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY, the probability of TOR being cost-effective was the highest. Subgroup analysis in non-visceral metastasis revealed 0.4 and 10% reduction in ICER from the base-case results of FUL5 500 mg versus EXE and TOR versus EXE, respectively, while threshold analysis indicated EVE and FUL prices should be reduced 73 and 30%, respectively. Conclusion As a second-line therapy for postmenopausal women with HR +/HER2 - mBC, TOR may be cost-effective relative to other alternatives and seems to be the most favorable choice, based on a WTP threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY.

If participants agree on a valuation rule, it can be decided whether or not, according to the given rule, these trades take place at equal value. If equality of values holds for all participants, then the exchange is said to be financially fair. It has been shown by Buhlmann and Jewell (1979) that, undermild assumptions, the constraint of financial fairness singles out a unique solution among the set of all Pareto efficient risk exchanges. In this paper, we find that an analogous statement is true if we limit ourselves to linear exchanges. Conditions are provided for existence and uniqueness of linear sharing rules that are both financially fair and Pareto efficient among all linear sharing rules. The performance of the linear rule is compared to that of the general (nonlinear) rule in a number of specific cases.","[Schumacher, Johannes M.] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Sect Quantitat Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Schumacher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Sect Quantitat Econ, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.m.schumacher@uva.nl,,"Schumacher, Johannes M./0000-0001-5753-3412",,,,,32,9,9,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2018,48.0,3,,,,,995,1024,,10.1017/asb.2018.25,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GV7RN,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446328300003,0

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company's submission for TOF is based predominantly on four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of TOF against placebo. Three RCTs investigated TOF in combination with methotrexate (MTX), and one RCT investigated TOF monotherapy. All four RCTs compared TOF with placebo plus cDMARDs, one RCT also included adalimumab as a comparator. The study population in the four RCTs comprised patients who were MTX inadequate responders or cDMARD inadequate responders (cDMARD-IR). The company performed network meta-analyses (NMA) to assess the relative efficacy of TOF compared with biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) in patients who were cDMARD-IR or bDMARD-IR with moderate-to-severe RA for European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response and change in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index at 6 months. The company's NMA concluded that TOF had comparable efficacy to bDMARDs currently recommended by NICE. The company submitted a de novo model that assessed the cost-effectiveness of TOF versus its comparators in six different populations: (1) cDMARD-IR with severe RA; (2) cDMARD-IR with severe RA for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; (3) bDMARD-IR; (4) bDMARD-IR for whom rituximab (RTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated; (5) bDMARD-IR for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; and, (6) cDMARD-IR with moderate RA. According to the company's economic analyses, in cDMARD-IR with severe RA, TOF plus MTX dominates or extendedly dominates most comparators, whilst TOF monotherapy is slightly less effective and less expensive than its comparators, with the cost saved per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) lost always higher than 50,000 pound. In bDMARD-IR with severe RA, RTX plus MTX dominated TOF plus MTX, but in patients for whom RTX was not an option, TOF plus MTX dominated all comparators included in the analysis (four comparators recommended by NICE were not included). In cDMARD-IR with moderate RA, the cost per QALY for TOF in combination with MTX or as monotherapy compared with a sequence of cDMARDs was estimated to be greater than 50,000 pound/QALY. The ERG identified a number of limitations in the company's analyses, including use of a fixed-effects model in the NMA and the use of treatment sequences in the cost-effectiveness model which did not reflect NICE recommendations. These limitations were addressed partly by the company during the clarification round and partly by the ERG. The exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG resulted in similar conclusions: (1) TOF plus MTX was dominated by RTX plus MTX; (2) TOF in combination with MTX or as monotherapy dominates or extendedly dominates some of its comparators in cDMARD-IR and bDMARD-IR with severe RA for whom RTX plus MTX was not an option; and (3) in cDMARD-IR with moderate RA, the cost per QALY of TOF in combination with MTX or as a monotherapy versus cDMARDs was in excess of 47,000 pound. The NICE Appraisal Committee consequently recommended TOF plus MTX as an option for patients whose disease has responded inadequately to intensive therapy with a combination of cDMARDs only if (1) disease is severe [a Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of more than 5.1] and (2) the company provides TOF with the discount agreed in the Patient Access Scheme (PAS). TOF plus MTX is also recommended as an option for adults whose disease has responded inadequately to, or who cannot have, other DMARDs, including at least one bDMARD, only if (1) disease is severe, (2) they cannot have RTX, and (3) the company provides TOF with the discount agreed in the PAS. For patients who are intolerant of MTX, or where MTX is contraindicated, TOF monotherapy is recommended where TOF plus MTX would be recommended.","[Uttley, Lesley; Bermejo, Inigo; Ren, Shijie; Martyn-St James, Marrissa; Wong, Ruth; Stevenson, Matt] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Scott, David L.] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Young, Adam] Univ Hertfordshire, Ctr Lifespan & Chron Illness Res, Coll Lane, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Sheffield; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; University of Hertfordshire,"Uttley, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",l.uttley@sheffield.ac.uk,"Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088; Uttley, Lesley/0000-0003-4603-9069; Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [19/04/17],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project Number 19/04/17).

Ixekizumab was compared with tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab), ustekinumab, secukinumab, best supportive care and, if non-biological treatment or phototherapy is suitable, also compared with systemic non-biological therapies and phototherapy with ultraviolet B radiation for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article presents a summary of the company submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the development of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the Appraisal Committee. The Evidence Review Group produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of ixekizumab based on the company submission. The company submission presented three randomised controlled trials identified in a systematic review. All randomised controlled trials were phase III, multicentre placebo-controlled trials including 3866 participants with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Two trials also included an active comparator (etanercept). All randomised controlled trials showed statistically significant increases in two primary outcomes, static Physician Global Assessment (0,1) and improvement of 75% from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Ixekizumab was generally well tolerated in the randomised controlled trials, with similar discontinuation rates because of adverse events as placebo or etanercept. The most frequent adverse events of special interest were infections and injection-site reactions. The company submission also included a network meta-analysis of relevant comparators. The Evidence Review Group highlighted some issues regarding the systematic review process and an issue with the generalisability of the findings in that the trials failed to include patients with moderate psoriasis according to a widely used definition. This issue was considered by the Appraisal Committee and the population was deemed generalisable to patients in England and Wales. Based on the network meta-analysis, the Appraisal Committee concluded that ixekizumab was more clinically effective than adalimumab and ustekinumab, and agreed it was likely that ixekizumab was similarly effective compared with secukinumab and infliximab while tolerability was similar to other biological treatments approved for treating psoriasis. The Evidence Review Group's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (1) the use of relative outcomes such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response to model the cost effectiveness; (2) the exclusion of the consequences of adverse events; (3) the assumption of no utility gain in the induction phase; (4) equal annual discontinuation rates for all treatments; (5) the selection of treatment sequences for consideration in the analyses and; (6) the transparency of the Visual Basic for Applications code used to develop the model. Although some of these issues were adjusted in the Evidence Review Group base case, the Evidence Review Group could not estimate the impact of all of these issues, and thus acknowledges that there are still uncertainties concerning the cost-effectiveness evidence. In the Evidence Review Group base-case incremental analysis, the treatment sequence incorporating ixekizumab in the second line has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 25,532 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. the etanercept sequence. Ixekizumab in the first-line sequence has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 39,129 pound per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with the treatment sequence incorporating ixekizumab in the second line. Consistent with its conclusion regarding clinical effectiveness, the Appraisal Committee concluded that the cost effectiveness of ixekizumab for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis was similar to that of other biological treatments, already recommended in previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. The committee concluded that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was within the range that could be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.","[Ramaekers, Bram L.

Since 2010, there has been increased activity in the development of treatments that aim to delay progression of the disease. Objective Our study involves a comprehensive review of the literature for evidence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), healthcare resource use (HCRU) and costs, and an assessment of the burden of illness of the condition. Methods We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify economic evaluations and HRQoL studies. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process for relevant studies from database origins to April 2017. Alongside the presentation of the study characteristics and the available evidence, we carried out a qualitative comparison using reference population estimates for HRQoL and national health expenditure for costs. Results Our search identified a total of 3241 records. After removing duplicates and not relevant articles, we analysed 124 publications referring to 88 studies published between 2000 and 2017. Sixty studies were HRQoL and 28 were studies on costs or HCRU. We observed an exponential growth of publications in the last 3-5 years, with the majority of the studies conducted in Europe and North America. Among the HRQoL studies, and despite regional differences, there was some agreement between estimates on the absolute and relative level of HRQoL for patients with IPF compared with the general population. Regarding costs, after adjustments for the cost years and currency, the suggested annual per capita cost of patients with IPF in North America was estimated around US$20,000, 2.5-3.5 times higher than the national healthcare expenditure. Additionally, studies that analysed patients with IPF alongside a matched control cohort suggested a significant increase in resource use and cost. Conclusion The reviewed evidence indicates that IPF has considerable impact on HRQoL, relative to the general population levels. Furthermore, in studies of cost and resource use, most estimates of the burden were consistent in suggesting an excess cost for patients with IPF compared with a control cohort or the national health expenditure. This confirms IPF as a growing threat for public health worldwide, with considerable impact to the patients and healthcare providers.","[Diamantopoulos, Alex; Wright, Emily; Vlahopoulou, Katerina; Cornic, Laura] Symmetron Ltd, Elstree, England; [Schoof, Nils] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Maher, Toby M.] Royal Brompton Hosp, NIHR Biomed Res Unit, London, England; [Maher, Toby M.] Imperial Coll London, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, Fibrosis Res Grp, London, England",Boehringer Ingelheim; Royal Brompton Hospital; Imperial College London,"Diamantopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Symmetron Ltd, Elstree, England.",alexd@symmetron.net,"Maher, Toby/AAM-1618-2020; Maher, Toby M/C-1575-2008","Maher, Toby/0000-0001-7192-9149; Diamantopoulos, Alex/0000-0002-5700-6265; Schoof, Nils/0000-0003-0509-9217",Boehringer Ingelheim,Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim),This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim.,,153,56,62,1,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2018,36.0,7,,,,,779,807,,10.1007/s40273-018-0631-8,0.0,,,29,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GJ5BX,29492843.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435397300006,0

We extend the standard GLM model structure to adopt Lagrange methods and P-splines such that smoothing and constraints are applied simultaneously as the parameters are estimated. Our results on Australian, Canadian and Norwegian data show that this modification results in an improvement in mortality projection in terms of producing more accurate forecasts in the out-of-sample testing. At the same time, projected male-to-female ratio of death rates at each age converges to a constant and the residuals of the models are sufficiently random, indicating that the use of smoothing does not adversely affect the fit of the model. Further, the irregular patterns in the estimates of the age-specific parameters are moderated as a result of smoothing and this model can be used to produce more regular projected life tables for pricing purposes.","[Pitt, David; Li, Jackie; Lim, Tian Kang] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",david.pitt@mq.edu.au; jackie.li@mq.edu.au; tian.lim@mq.edu.au,,"Li, Jackie/0000-0001-8399-6584; Pitt, David/0000-0002-6976-7168",,,,,40,9,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2018,48.0,2,,,,,509,541,,10.1017/asb.2017.44,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GF5UG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432032700002,0

This leads to the definition of buyer's and seller's XVA, which in turn identify a no-arbitrage interval. In the case that borrowing and lending rates coincide, we provide a fully explicit expression for the unique XVA, expressed as a percentage of the price of the traded claim, and for the corresponding replication strategies. In the general case of asymmetric funding, repo, and collateral rates, we study the semilinear partial differential equations characterizing buyer's and seller's XVA and show the existence of a unique classical solution to it.

In the unit root case, Anderson-Hsiao lagged variable instruments satisfy orthogonality conditions but are well known to be irrelevant. For a fixed time series sample size (T) IV is inconsistent and approaches a shifted Cauchy-distributed random variate as the cross-section sample size n -> infinity. But when T -> infinity, either for fixed n or as n -> infinity, IV is root T consistent and its limit distribution is a ratio of random variables that converges to twice a standard Cauchy as n -> infinity. In this case, the usual instruments are uncorrelated with the regressor but irrelevance does not prevent consistent estimation. The same Cauchy limit theory holds sequentially and jointly as (n, T)-> infinity with no restriction on the divergence rates of n and T. When the common autoregressive root rho = 1 + c/root T the panel comprises a collection of mildly integrated time series. In this case, the IV estimator is root n consistent for fixed T and root nT consistent with limit distribution N ( 0,4) when n, T -> infinity sequentially or jointly. These results are robust for common roots of the form rho = 1 + c/T-gamma for all gamma is an element of(0,1) and joint convergence holds. Limit normality holds but the variance changes when gamma = 1. When gamma > 1 joint convergence fails and sequential limits differ with different rates of convergence. These findings reveal the fragility of conventional Gaussian IV asymptotics to persistence in dynamic panel regressions.","[Phillips, Peter C.

Based on the analysis of the martingale problem, we introduce the notion of weak solution for stochastic differential equations under nonlinear expectations and obtain an existence theorem under the Lipschitz continuity condition of the coefficients. The approach to establish the existence of weak solutions generalizes the classical Girsanov transformation method in that it no longer requires the two (probability) measures to be absolutely continuous.","[Guo, Xin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pan, Chen] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore; [Peng, Shige] Shandong Univ, Sch Math, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National University of Singapore; Shandong University,"Pan, C (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, Singapore, Singapore.",xinguo@berkeley.edu; huoshanpc@126.com; peng@sdu.edu.cn,,,,,,,41,6,6,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The QLU-C10D contains ten dimensions (Physical, Role, Social and Emotional Functioning; Pain, Fatigue, Sleep, Appetite, Nausea, Bowel Problems), each with four levels. To be used in cost-utility analysis, country-specific valuation sets are required. Objective The aim of this study was to provide Australian utility weights for the QLU-C10D. Methods An Australian online panel was quota-sampled to ensure population representativeness by sex and age (>= 18 years). Participants completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) consisting of 16 choice-pairs. Each pair comprised two QLU-C10D health states plus life expectancy. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression, parameterised to fit the quality-adjusted life-year framework. Utility weights were calculated as the ratio of each QOL dimension-level coefficient to the coefficient on life expectancy. Results A total of 1979 panel members opted in, 1904 (96%) completed at least one choice-pair, and 1846 (93%) completed all 16 choice-pairs. Dimension weights were generally monotonic: poorer levels within each dimension were generally associated with greater utility decrements. The dimensions that impacted most on choice were, in order, Physical Functioning, Pain, Role Functioning and Emotional Functioning. Oncology-relevant dimensions with moderate impact were Nausea and Bowel Problems. Fatigue, Trouble Sleeping and Appetite had relatively small impact. The value of the worst health state was - 0.096, somewhat worse than death. Conclusions This study provides the first country-specific value set for the QLU-C10D, which can facilitate cost-utility analyses when applied to data collected with the EORTC QLQ-C30, prospectively and retrospectively.","[King, Madeleine T.; Costa, Daniel S.

Specifically, analysing the recent high frequency dynamics of a set of US stocks, we find that since 2001 the level of synchronization of large price movements across assets has significantly increased. We find that only a minor fraction of these systemic events can be connected with the release of pre-announced macroeconomic news. Finally, the larger is the multiplicity of the event-i.e. how many assets have swung together-the larger is the probability of a new event occurring in the near future, as well as its multiplicity. To reproduce these facts, due to the self- and cross-exciting nature of the event dynamics, we propose an approach based on Hawkes processes. For each event, we directly model the multiplicity as a multivariate point process, neglecting the identity of the specific assets. This allows us to introduce a parsimonious parametrization of the kernel of the process and to achieve a reliable description of the dynamics of large price movements for a high-dimensional portfolio.","[Calcagnile, Lucio Maria; Treccani, Michele] LIST SpA, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Calcagnile, Lucio Maria; Bormetti, Giacomo; Treccani, Michele; Lillo, Fabrizio] QUANTLab, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo; Lillo, Fabrizio] Univ Bologna, Dept Math, Piazza Porta San Donato 5, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Marmi, Stefano; Lillo, Fabrizio] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Marmi, Stefano] CNRS, Lab Fibonacci, UMI 3483, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Treccani, Michele] Mediobanca SpA, Piazzetta E Cuccia 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy",University of Bologna; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI),"Calcagnile, LM (通讯作者)，LIST SpA, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.;Calcagnile, LM (通讯作者)，QUANTLab, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",l.calcagnile@list-group.com,"Marmi, Stefano/AAB-6240-2022","Marmi, Stefano/0000-0001-5105-8876; Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505","European Commission H Program [INFRAIA-1- 2014-2015, 654024]; Scuola Normale Superiore [SNS14BBORMETTI]; [SNS13LILLB]",European Commission H Program; Scuola Normale Superiore;,FL was partially supported by the 'Systemic risk in financial markets across time scales' [grant number SNS13LILLB]; the European Commission H2020 Program under the scheme [INFRAIA-1- 2014-2015]: Research Infrastructures [grant agreement number 654024] SoBigData: Social Mining & Big Data Ecosystem.

Our main result is that log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable timescale. This leads us to adopt the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault [Long memory in continuous-time stochastic volatility models. Math. Finance, 1998, 8(4), 291-323]. We call our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H < 1/2. We demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not a long memory process in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility has been widely accepted as a stylized fact.","[Gatheral, Jim] CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Jaisson, Thibault; Rosenbaum, Mathieu] Ecole Polytech, CMAP, Paris, France",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Gatheral, J (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",jim.gatheral@baruch.cuny.edu,,,Risk Foundation; French Banking Federation; ERC [679836 STAQAMOF]; chair 'Analytics and Models for Regulation',Risk Foundation; French Banking Federation; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); chair 'Analytics and Models for Regulation',Thibault Jaisson was financially supported by the chair 'Risques Financiers' of the Risk Foundation and the chair 'Marches en Mutation' of the French Banking Federation.

In this paper, we propose and develop a new method for estimation of their parameters-the method of Winsorized moments (MWM)-which is conceptually similar to the method of trimmed moments (MTM) and thus is robust and computationally efficient. Both approaches yield explicit formulas of parameter estimators for log-location-scale families and their variants, which are commonly used to model claim severity. Large-sample properties of the new estimators are provided and corroborated through simulations. Their performance is also compared to that of MTM and the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE). In addition, the effect of model choice and parameter estimation method on risk pricing is illustrated using actual data that represent hurricane damages in the United States from 1925 to 1995. In particular, the estimated pure premiums for an insurance layer are computed when the lognormal and log-logistic models are fitted to the data using the MWM, MTM and MLE methods.","[Zhao, Qian] Robert Morris Univ, Dept Math, Moon Township, PA 15108 USA; [Brazauskas, Vytaras; Ghorai, Jugal] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Math Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Robert Morris University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Brazauskas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Math Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",zhao@rmu.edu; vytaras@uwm.edu; jugal@uwm.edu,"Zhao, Qian/JXW-7901-2024",,,,,,35,8,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2018,48.0,1,,,,,275,309,,10.1017/asb.2017.30,0.0,,,35,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FT3FK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423032500011,0

However, there are only a few applicable candidate models that have the full-range tail dependence property. In this paper, we present a general approach to constructing bivariate copulas that have full-range tail dependence in both upper and lower tails and are able to account for both reflection symmetry and reflection asymmetry. The general approach is based on mixtures of positive regularly varying random variables, and the full-range tail dependence property is established for such a general model. In order to construct copulas that possess the above dependence properties and are fast to compute, we construct a full-range tail dependence copula based on mixtures of Pareto random variables. We derive dependence properties of the proposed copula, and the extreme value copula based on it. A comparison with the full-range tail dependence copula proposed in Hua (2017) has been conducted, and the computational speed has been largely improved by the copula proposed in the current paper.

Similar deformations were used in one-factor Levy models to price options with barrier and lookback features and credit default swaps (CDSs). In the present paper, we generalize this approach to models, where the dynamics of the assets is modeled as eXt, where X is a Levy process, and the interest rate rt is stochastic. Assuming that X and r are independent, and Lr, the infinitesimal generator of the pricing semigroup in the model for the short rate, satisfies weak regularity conditions, which hold for popular models of the short rate, we develop a variation of the pricing procedure for Levy models which is almost as fast as in the case of the constant interest rate. Numerical examples show that about 0.15 second suffices to calculate prices of 8 options of same maturity in a two-factor model with the error tolerance 510-5 and less; in a three-factor model, accuracy of order 0.001-0.005 is achieved in about 0.2 second. Similar results are obtained for quanto CDS, where an additional stochastic factor is the exchange rate. We suggest a class of Levy models with the stochastic interest rate driven by 1-3 factors, which allows for fast calculations. This class can satisfy the current regulatory requirements for banks mandating sufficiently sophisticated credit risk models.","[Boyarchenko, Svetlana] Univ Texas Austin, 1 Univ Stn C3100, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Levendorskii, Sergei] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Leicester,"Boyarchenko, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Stn C3100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sboyarch@eco.utexas.edu,,"Boyarchenko, Svetlana/0000-0002-6120-1821",,,,,48,7,8,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

We pay particular attention to the case where central limit theorems may fail to hold, due to relatively strong time-series dependence and/or the nonexistence of higher-ordermoments. Several previous studies have presented various versions of laws of large numbers for sequences/triangular arrays, but their convergence rates were not fully investigated. This study is the first to investigate the convergence rates of the sums of alpha-mixing triangular arrays whose mixing coefficients are permitted to decay arbitrarily slowly. We consider two kinds of asymptotic assumptions: one is that the time distance between adjacent observations is fixed for any sample size n; and the other, called the infill assumption, is that it shrinks to zero as n tends to infinity. Our convergence theorems indicate that an explicit trade-off exists between the rate of convergence and the degree of dependence. While the results under the infill assumption can be seen as a direct extension of those under the fixed-distance assumption, they are new and particularly useful for deriving sharper convergence rates of discretization biases in estimating continuous-time processes from discretely sampled observations. We also discuss some examples to which our results and techniques are useful and applicable: a moving-average process with long lasting past shocks, a continuous-time diffusion process with weak mean reversion, and a near-unit-root process.","[Kanaya, Shin] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kanaya, Shin] IER, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",CREATES; Aarhus University,"Kanaya, S (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.;Kanaya, S (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, IER, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",skanaya@econ.au.dk,,,"CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences [DFF - 4182-00279]","CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","The author thanks Bruce E.

Many of these assignment schemes use lotteries to ration seats when schools are oversubscribed. The resulting random assignment opens the door to credible quasi-experimental research designs for the evaluation of school effectiveness. Yet the question of how best to separate the lottery-generated randomization integral to such designs from non-random preferences and priorities remains open. This paper develops easily-implemented empirical strategies that fully exploit the random assignment embedded in a wide class of mechanisms, while also revealing why seats are randomized at one school but not another. We use these methods to evaluate charter schools in Denver, one of a growing number of districts that combine charter and traditional public schools in a unified assignment system. The resulting estimates show large achievement gains from charter school attendance. Our approach generates efficiency gains over ad hoc methods, such as those that focus on schools ranked first, while also identifying a more representative average causal effect. We also show how to use centralized assignment mechanisms to identify causal effects in models with multiple school sectors.","[Abdulkadiroglu, Atila] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Abdulkadiroglu, Atila; Angrist, Joshua D.; Pathak, Parag A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Angrist, Joshua D.; Pathak, Parag A.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Narita, Yusuke] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Narita, Yusuke] Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yale University; Yale University,"Abdulkadiroglu, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Abdulkadiroglu, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",atila.abdulkadiroglu@duke.edu; angrist@mit.edu; yusuke.narita@yale.edu; ppathak@mit.edu,"Angrist, Josh/ADL-8782-2022",,"Laura and John Arnold Foundation; National Science Foundation [SES-1056325, SES-1426541]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1056325] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Laura and John Arnold Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Alisha Chiarelli, Brian Eschbacher, Van Schoales, and the staff at Denver Public Schools for answering our questions and facilitating access to data.

To reduce ex post moral hazard, we assume that both the insured and the insurer would pay more for a larger realization of the insurable loss. When the insurance premium principle preserves the convex order, we show that any admissible insurance contract is suboptimal to a two-layer insurance policy under the criterion of minimizing the insured's total risk exposure quantified by value at risk, tail value at risk or an expectile. The form of optimal insurance can be further simplified to be one-layer by imposing an additional weak condition on the premium principle. Finally, we use Wang's premium principle and the expected value premium principle to illustrate the applicability of our results, and find that optimal insurance solutions are affected not only by the size of the excluded loss but also by the risk measure chosen to quantify the insured's risk exposure.

The appraisal assessed adalimumab as monotherapy in adult patients with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the technology based on the company's submission to NICE. The evidence was mainly derived from three randomised controlled trials comparing adalimumab with placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe HS. The clinical-effectiveness review found that significantly more patients achieved a clinical response in the adalimumab groups than in the control groups but that the treatment effect varied between trials and there was uncertainty regarding its impact on a range of other relevant outcomes as well as long-term efficacy. The company's submitted Markov model assessed the incremental cost effectiveness of adalimumab versus standard care for the treatment of HS from the perspective of the UK NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) over a lifetime horizon. The original submitted model, including a patient access scheme (PAS), suggested that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for adalimumab versus standard care was expected to be A 16,162 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Following a critique of the model, the ERG's preferred base case, which corrected programming errors and structural problems surrounding discontinuation rules and incorporated a lower unit cost for HS surgery, resulted in a probabilistic ICER of A 29,725 pound per QALY gained. Based on additional analyses undertaken by the company and the ERG following the publication of the appraisal consultation document (ACD), the Appraisal Committee concluded that the maximum possible ICER for adalimumab compared with supportive care was between A 28,500 pound and A 33,200 pound per QALY gained but was likely to be lower. The Appraisal Committee recommended adalimumab (with the PAS) for the treatment of active moderate-to-severe HS in adults whose disease has not responded to conventional systemic therapy.","[Tappenden, Paul; Carroll, Christopher; Stevens, John W.; Rawdin, Andrew; Grimm, Sabine; Clowes, Mark; Kaltenthaler, Eva] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Ingram, John R.] Cardiff Univ, Inst Infect & Immun, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Collier, Fiona] Stirling Community Hosp, Stirling, Scotland; [Ghazavi, Mohammad] Nottingham NHS Treatment Ctr, Nottingham, England",University of Sheffield; Cardiff University,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,"Carroll, Chris/HHC-1512-2022; Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/HSE-7402-2023","Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/0000-0002-2175-7999; Tappenden, Paul/0000-0001-6612-2332",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/06/09],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project No. 15/06/09).

Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, beta(0), are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity {A(i0)}(i=1)(N) as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated.

Such early models can be used to inform research and development about the design and management of new medical technologies to mitigate the risks, perceived by industry and the public sector, associated with market access and reimbursement. Over the past 25 years it has been suggested that health economic evaluation in the early stages may benefit the development and diffusion of medical products. Early health technology assessment has been suggested in the context of iterative economic evaluation alongside phase I and II clinical research to inform clinical trial design, market access, and pricing. In addition, performing early health technology assessment was also proposed at an even earlier stage for managing technology portfolios. This scoping review suggests a generally accepted definition of early health technology assessment to be all methods used to inform industry and other stakeholders about the potential value of new medical products in development, including methods to quantify and manage uncertainty. The present review also aimed to identify recent published empirical studies employing an early-stage assessment of a medical product. With most included studies carried out to support a market launch, the dominant methodology was early health economic modeling. Further methodological development is required, in particular, by combining systems engineering and health economics to manage uncertainty in medical product portfolios.","[IJzerman, Maarten J.; Koffijberg, Hendrik] Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Enschede, Netherlands; [IJzerman, Maarten J.] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Evidence Synth & Hlth Econ Unit, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Fenwick, Elisabeth] ICON Plc, Oxford, England; [Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment Collaborat, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Twente; Luxembourg Institute of Health; ICON plc; University of Toronto,"IJzerman, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Enschede, Netherlands.;IJzerman, MJ (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Evidence Synth & Hlth Econ Unit, Strassen, Luxembourg.",m.j.ijzerman@utwente.nl,"IJzerman, Maarten/AAB-6894-2020","IJzerman, Maarten/0000-0001-5788-5805; Koffijberg, Hendrik/0000-0002-1753-0652; Krahn, Murray/0000-0001-5836-397X; van Tinteren, Harm/0000-0002-4626-8702",,,,,77,100,104,3,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2017,35.0,7,,,,,727,740,,10.1007/s40273-017-0509-1,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EY0YS,28432642.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403688100006,0

There is, however, no consensus on how to take these differences into account when evaluating policies. While prominent in the economic literature, the standard utilitarian criterion is controversial. According to some, interpersonal comparability of utilities involves value judgments with little objective basis. Others argue that social justice is primarily about the distribution of commodities assigned to individuals, rather than their subjective satisfaction or happiness. In this paper, we propose and axiomatically characterize a criterion, named opportunity-equivalent utilitarian, that addresses these claims. First, our criterion ranks social alternatives on the basis of individuals' ordinal preferences. Second, it compares individuals based on the fairness of their assignments. Opportunity-equivalent utilitarianism requires society to maximize the sum of specific indices of well-being that are cardinal, interpersonally comparable, and represent each individual's preferences.","[Piacquadio, Paolo Giovanni] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Piacquadio, Paolo Giovanni] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; Statistics Norway,"Piacquadio, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway.;Piacquadio, PG (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",p.g.piacquadio@econ.uio.no,,,"Centre for the Study of Equality, Social Organization, and Performance (ESOP) - Research Council of Norway [179552]","Centre for the Study of Equality, Social Organization, and Performance (ESOP) - Research Council of Norway","The author thanks the editor, three anonymous referees, Rolf Aaberge, Geir Asheim, Claude d'Aspremont, Bard Harstad, Aanund Hylland, Edwin Leuven, Kalle Moene, Frikk Nesje, and, particularly, Francois Maniquet and William Thomson.

Adherence to nebulised treatments is low; improving adherence is hypothesised to reduce rates of exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics and lung function decline. Objective A state transition model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of an intervention aimed at increasing patient adherence to nebulised and inhaled antibiotics compared with current CF care, in advance of the forthcoming CFHealthHub randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods The model estimated the costs and health outcomes for each option from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. Health gains were valued in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) trajectories were predicted over three lung function strata: (1) FEV1 >= 70%, (2) FEV1 40-69% and (3) FEV1 <40%. Additional states were included to represent 'post-lung transplantation' and 'dead'. The model was populated using CF Registry data, literature and expert opinion. Costs were presented at 2016 values. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results If effective, the adherence intervention is expected to produce an additional 0.19 QALYs and cost savings of 64,078 pound per patient. Across all analyses, the intervention dominated current care. Over a 5-year period, the intervention is expected to generate cost savings of 49.5 pound million for the estimated 2979 patients with CF with Pseudomonas aeruginosa currently aged >= 16 years in the UK. If applied to a broader population of adult patients with CF receiving any nebulised therapy, the expected savings could be considerably greater. Conclusions If effective, the adherence intervention is expected to produce additional health gains at a lower cost than current CF care. However, the economic analysis should be revisited upon completion of the full RCT. More generally, the analysis suggests that considerable gains could be accrued through the implementation of adherence interventions that shift care from expensive hospital-based rescue to community-based prevention.","[Tappenden, Paul; Sadler, Susannah] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Wildman, Martin] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Sadler, Susannah/0000-0001-5935-8507; Tappenden, Paul/0000-0001-6612-2332",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [RP-PG-1212-20015]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-1212-20015] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-1212-20015] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This study represents an early evaluation undertaken as part of the CFHealthHub ACtiF programme, funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (grant number RP-PG-1212-20015).

The primary goal of this paper is to explain family investment decisions under the assumptions of household member's preferences and efficient risk sharing based on the collective household model. In particular, by examining the absolute (relative) risk aversion of the household welfare function, we demonstrate how household's portfolio allocation in stocks changes with family wealth. We examine two types of preference heterogeneity between family members: parameter heterogeneity and functional form heterogeneity. This study offers an alternative explanation of household portfolio choice corresponding with the observation that wealthier households tend to hold greater share of their wealth in risky assets. Specifically, if two decision-makers have standard constant relative risk aversion preference with different relative risk aversions in a household, family's relative risk aversion decreases as household wealth increases (decreasing relative risk aversion).","[Zhang, Weiwei] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, 361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Zhang, WW (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, 361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",wzhang41@crimson.ua.edu,,"Zhang, Weiwei/0000-0003-4579-1849",,,,,21,3,3,12,48,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

The probability of ruin, in continuous and finite time, is numerically evaluated under the classical Cramer-Lundberg risk process framework for a large motor insurance portfolio, where we allow for a posteriori premium adjustments, according to the claim record of each individual policyholder. Focusing on the classical model for bonus-malus systems, we propose that the probability of ruin can be interpreted as a measure to decide between different bonus-malus scales or even between different bonus-malus rules. In our work, the required initial surplus can also be evaluated. We consider an application of a bonus-malus system for motor insurance to study the impact of experience rating in ruin probabilities. For that, we used a real commercial scale of an insurer operating in the Portuguese market, and we also work on various well-known optimal bonus-malus scales estimated with real data from that insurer. Results involving these scales are discussed.","[Afonso, Lourdes B.; Cardoso, Rui M.

First, we detail the application of the strong stability method in risk models realized by V. Kalashnikov in 2000. In particular, we investigate the conditions and the approximation error of the real model, in which the probability distribution of the claim amounts is not known, by the classical risk model with exponentially distributed claim sizes. Using the nonparametric approach, we propose different kernel estimators for the density of claim amounts in the real model. A simulation study is performed to numerically compare between the approximation errors (stability bounds) obtained using the different proposed kernel densities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This prohibition prevents the use of the standard actuarial fairness principle to price life insurance products. According to current actuarial practice, unisex premiums are calculated with a simple weighting rule of the gender-specific life tables. This procedure is likely to violate portfolio fairness principles. Up to our knowledge, in the actuarial literature there is no unisex mortality model that respects the unisex fairness principle. This paper is the first attempt to fill this gap. First, we recall the notion of unisex fairness principle and the corresponding unisex fair premium. Then, we provide a unisex stochastic mortality model for the mortality intensity that is underlying the pricing of a life portfolio of females and males belonging to the same cohort. Finally, we calibrate the unisex mortality model using the unisex fairness principle. We find that the weighting coefficient between the males' and females' own mortalities depends mainly on the quote of portfolio relative to each gender, on the age, and on the type of insurance products. The knowledge of a proper unisex mortality model could help life insurance companies to better understanding the nature of the risk of a mixed portfolio. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we make an effort to remove this restriction as it excludes the cases with asymptotically dependent X and Y. We also extend the study to the infinite-time ruin probability.

Objective The aim of this paper was to review the recent literature valuating the costs of informal care in a group of selected diseases from 2005 to 2015. Methods We carried out a systematic review on the economic impact of informal care, focusing on six selected diseases: arthritis or osteoarthritis, cancer, dementia, mental diseases, multiple sclerosis and stroke. Results We selected 91 cost-of-illness articles. The average weight attributed to the informal care cost over the total cost was highly relevant for dementia, stroke, mental diseases, cancer and multiple sclerosis. The most frequent valuation method applied was the opportunity cost method, followed by the proxy good method. The annual cost of informal care presented a high variability depending on the disease and geographic location. Distinguishing by type of illness, the disease with the highest annual value of informal caregiving was dementia, followed by mental illness and multiple sclerosis. The average hourly unit cost was (sic)11.43 (2015 values), varying noticeably depending on the geographic location. Conclusion This paper identifies several aspects that should be enhanced to promote comparability between studies and countries, and it sends key messages for incorporating informal care costs to adequately measure the economic impact of diseases.","[Oliva-Moreno, Juan; Maria Pena-Longobardo, Luz] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Toledo, Spain; [Trapero-Bertran, Marta] Univ Int Catalunya, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [del Pozo-Rubio, Raul] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Cuenca, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Oliva-Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Toledo, Spain.",Juan.OlivaMoreno@uclm.es,"DEL POZO RUBIO, RAUL/KBD-4150-2024; Trapero-Bertran, Marta/AAA-9442-2021; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Pena Longobardo, Luz Maria/K-6413-2017","Trapero-Bertran, Marta/0000-0002-9233-1776; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Pena Longobardo, Luz Maria/0000-0001-7224-2189","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48217-C2-1, ECON2013-48217-C2-2-R]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Programa Estatal de Investigacion, Desarrollo e Innovacion Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica Tecnica y de Innovacion 2013-2016'' programme.

First, a portfolio of traded financial instrument aimed at replicating the liability cash flow is fixed. Then the residual cash flow is managed by repeated one-period replication using only cash funds. The latter part takes capital requirements and costs into account, as well as limited liability and risk averseness of capital providers. The cost-of-capital margin is the value of the residual cash flow. We set up a general framework for the cost-of-capital margin and relate it to dynamic risk measurement. Moreover, we present explicit formulas and properties of the cost-of-capital margin under further assumptions on the model for the liability cash flow and on the conditional risk measures and utility functions. Finally, we highlight computational aspects of the cost-of-capital margin, and related quantities, in terms of an example from life insurance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and the large (approximately $13,500) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a patient's stay reaches a threshold number of days. Discharges increase substantially after the threshold, with the marginal discharged patient in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and behavioral response in a high mortality population, we are unable to detect any compelling evidence of an impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, we estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge decisions. When we conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about $2,100 per admission, or about 5% of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate substantially greater savings, but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our results highlight how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare spending, without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.","[Einav, Liran] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Einav, Liran; Finkelstein, Amy; Mahoney, Neale] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mahoney, Neale] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago,"Einav, L (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Einav, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",leinav@stanford.edu; afink@mit.edu; Neale.Mahoney@chicagobooth.edu,,,NIA [R01 AG032449]; Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago; National Science Foundation [SES-1730466],NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, five anonymous referees, our discussants Judy Chevalier and Mark Shepard, and many seminar participants for helpful comments.

The insurer can buy proportional reinsurance business to hedge its insurance risks. However, the insurer is ambiguous about the insurance claims and risky assets. Specifically, the insurance claim is exponentially distributed and the rate parameter is uncertain. Besides, the return of a stock is uncertain. The insurer holds ambiguous beliefs over these states. The goal of the insurer is to maximize the smooth ambiguity utility proposed in Klibanoff et al. (2005). The equilibrium control is introduced to derive the time-consistent solution. In the end, a sensitivity analysis is presented to show the economic behaviors of the insurer under the smooth ambiguity. Results reveal that the uncertain beliefs play an important role in the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies. When the insurer is more risk averse towards ambiguity, the insurer will invest less in the ambiguous asset and more in the non-ambiguous asset. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There are many public goods and each public good benefits a different group of players. The structure of the game induces a bipartite network structure, where players are listed on one side and the public good groups they form are listed on the other side. The main result of the paper shows the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium. The unique Nash equilibrium is also shown to be asymptotically stable. Then the paper provides some comparative statics analysis regarding pure redistribution, taxation and subsidies. It appears that small redistributions of wealth may sometimes be neutral, but generally, the effects of redistributive policies depend on how public good groups are related in the contribution network structure.","[Richefort, Lionel] Univ Nantes, IAE Nantes Inst Econ & Management, LEMNA, Batiment Erdre,Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France",Nantes Universite,"Richefort, L (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, IAE Nantes Inst Econ & Management, LEMNA, Batiment Erdre,Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",lionel.richefort@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,47,4,4,1,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

The STA was a review of NICE's 2015 guidance (TA360) in which Nab-Pac+Gem was not recommended for patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The review was prompted by a proposed Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount on the price of Nab-Pac and new evidence that might lead to a change in the guidance. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group at the University of Liverpool was the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarises the ERG's review of the company's evidence submission for Nab-Pac+Gem, and the Appraisal Committee (AC) decision. The final scope issued by NICE listed three comparators: gemcitabine monotherapy (Gem), gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine (Gem+Cap), and a combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil (FOLFIRINOX). Clinical evidence for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem was from the phase III CA046 randomized controlled trial. Analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) showed statistically significant improvement for patients treated with Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem. Clinical evidence for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus FOLFIRINOX and versus Gem+Cap was derived from a network meta-analysis (NMA). Results of the NMA did not indicate a statistically significant difference in OS or PFS for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus either Gem+Cap or FOLFIRINOX. The ERG's main concerns with the clinical effectiveness evidence were difficulties in identifying the patient population for whom treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem is most appropriate, and violation of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption in the CA046 trial. The ERG highlighted methodological issues in the cost-effectiveness analysis pertaining to the modelling of survival outcomes, estimation of drug costs and double counting of adverse-event disutilities. The AC accepted all the ERG's amendments to the company's cost-effectiveness model; however, these did not make important differences to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The company's base-case ICER was 46,932 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the comparison of Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem. Treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem was dominated both by treatment with Gem+Cap and with FOLFIRINOX in the company's base case. The AC concluded that the most plausible ICER for treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem versus Gem was in the range of 41,000- pound 46,000 pound per QALY gained. The AC concluded that Nab-Pac+Gem was not cost effective compared with Gem+Cap or FOLFIRINOX, and accepted that treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem met the end-of-life criteria versus Gem but did not consider Nab-Pac+Gem to meet the end-of-life criteria compared with Gem+Cap or FOLFIRINOX. The AC also concluded that although patients who would receive Nab-Pac+Gem rather than FOLFIRINOX or Gem+Cap were difficult to distinguish, they were identifiable in clinical practice. The AC recommended treatment with Nab-Pac+Gem for patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer for whom other combination chemotherapies were unsuitable and who would otherwise receive Gem.","[Stainthorpe, Angela; Greenhalgh, Janette; Bagust, Adrian; Richardson, Marty; Boland, Angela; Beale, Sophie; Duarte, Rui; Kotas, Eleanor; Palmer, Daniel] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Banks, Lindsay] North West Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Stainthorpe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",angela.stainthorpe@liverpool.ac.uk,"Duarte, Rui/C-9635-2012","Duarte, Rui/0000-0001-6485-7415; Richardson, Marty/0000-0002-7097-8704; Stainthorpe, Angela/0000-0002-2531-9371",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Programme [14/90/01],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Programme,"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Programme (project number 14/90/01; see the Health Technology Assessment programme website for further project information, http://www.hta.ac.uk).

We define two types of ICC: the one period integrated chance constraint (OICC) and the multiperiod integrated chance constraint (MICC). As their names suggest, the OICC covers only one period, whereas several periods are taken into account with the MICC. A multistage stochastic linear programming model is therefore developed for this purpose and a special mention is paid to the modeling of the MICC. Based on a numerical example, we first analyze the effects of the OICC and the MICC on the optimal decisions (asset allocation and contribution rate) of a pension fund. By definition, the MICC is more restrictive and safer compared to the OICC. Second, we quantify this MICC safety increase. The results show that although the optimal decisions from the OICC and the MICC differ, the total costs are very close, showing that the MICC is definitely a better approach since it is more prudent.","[Toukourou, Youssouf A.

In this article, we examine the medicines appraisal process in Wales, its timeliness and its impact on medicines availability in Wales, and compare its processes and recommendations with the two other UK health technology appraisal bodies [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC)]. Methods We reviewed the medicines appraisals conducted by AWMSG between October 2010 and September 2015. The duration of the process and the recommendations made by AWMSG were compared with those of NICE and SMC. Only publicly available data were considered in this review. Results AWMSG conducted 171 single technology appraisals for 137 medicines during the study period (34 were for medicines previously appraised by AWMSG but these were for new indications). Of these, 152 appraisals were supported for use in NHS Wales (33 with restrictions) and 19 were not supported. Recommendations broadly concurred with SMC and NICE for the majority of appraisals. Compared with NICE recommendations, the median time advantage gained in Wales for those medicines that received a positive AWMSG recommendation and which were subsequently superseded by NICE advice was 10.6 months (range 3.5-48.3 months; n = 17). Conclusion This review highlights the work carried out by AWMSG over a 5-year period, and provides evidence to support the effectiveness of the appraisal process in terms of patients in Wales gaining earlier access to medicines and efficiency through reduced duplication with NICE.","[Varnava, Alice; Bracchi, Robert; Samuels, Karen; Routledge, Philip A.] Univ Hosp Llandough, Acad Ctr, All Wales Therapeut & Toxicol Ctr, Penlan Rd, Llandough CF64 2XX, Vale Of Glamorg, Wales; [Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Varnava, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Llandough, Acad Ctr, All Wales Therapeut & Toxicol Ctr, Penlan Rd, Llandough CF64 2XX, Vale Of Glamorg, Wales.",alice.varnava@wales.nhs.uk,"Varnava, Alice/A-9699-2012; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459; Varnava, Alice/0000-0002-5090-9541",,,,,54,10,10,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36.0,5,,,,,613,624,,10.1007/s40273-018-0632-7,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29520603.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430399300009,0

Objective Our objective was to analyse the cost effectiveness of combinations of different DAAs compared with ribavirin and peginterferon-alpha-2a, taking into account rebates from tender negotiations. Methods We used a compartmental model specifically developed for Norway to simulate hepatitis C and complications with and without different DAAs. All costs were based on Norwegian fees and estimates, estimating healthcare sector costs for the year 2016. We performed Monte Carlo simulations on uncertain input parameters to facilitate probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results For patients diagnosed with genotype 1, the combination of paritaprevir, ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir was cost effective compared with eight other available alternatives, given a cost-effectiveness threshold of (sic)70,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. For genotype 2, the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin was the most effective and cost-effective alternative for all patients. Among available alternatives for patients with genotype 3, sofosbuvir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin was the most cost-effective alternative, although the combination of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir was somewhat more effective. Conclusions For each of the hepatitis C genotypes 1, 2 and 3, there were combinations of DAAs that were cost effective in a Norwegian setting. As a result of recent tender negotiations in Norway, treating all diagnosed patients with hepatitis C with the most cost-effective DAAs will result in lower total expenditure on these medications compared with 2015.","[Wisloff, Torbjorn; White, Richard; Meijerink, Hinta] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol & Modelling, Oslo, Norway; [Wisloff, Torbjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Dalgard, Olav] Akershus Univ Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Lorenskog, Norway; [Dalgard, Olav] Univ Oslo, Div Med & Lab Sci, Oslo, Norway; [Amundsen, Ellen J.] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Subst Use, Oslo, Norway; [Lovlie, Astrid Louise] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Registries, Oslo, Norway; [Klovstad, Hilde] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept TB Blood Borne & Sexually Transmitted Infect, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Wisloff, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol & Modelling, Oslo, Norway.;Wisloff, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway.",twisloff@gmail.com,"Wisløff, Torbjørn/AFM-8289-2022","Wisløff, Torbjørn/0000-0002-7539-082X; White, Richard Aubrey/0000-0002-6747-1726; Meijerink, Hinta/0000-0002-5898-2778",,,,,36,9,11,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36.0,5,,,,,591,601,,10.1007/s40273-017-0604-3,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29396744.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430399300007,0

In a two-period decentralized model, this paper shows that when a market culture allows firms to make exploding offers, unraveling is more likely to occur and lead to a less socially desirable matching outcome. A market with a larger uncertainty in early stages is not necessarily more vulnerable to the presence of exploding offers: the conclusion depends on the specific information structure. A market tends to be less vulnerable to exploding offers when there is an excess supply of labor. While a banning policy on exploding offers tends to be supported by high quality firms and workers, it can be opposed by those of low qualities. This explains the prevalence of exploding offers in practice.","[Pan, Siqi] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Pan, SQ (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",siqi.pan@unimelb.edu.au,,"Pan, Siqi/0000-0002-3148-1922",,,,,27,4,5,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Objective We sought to document all applications of LCA in the stated-preference literature in health and to inform future studies by identifying current norms in published applications. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases. We included stated-preference studies that used LCA to explore preference heterogeneity in healthcare or public health. Two co-authors independently evaluated titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Abstracted key outcomes included segmentation methods, preference elicitation methods, number of attributes and levels, sample size, model selection criteria, number of classes reported, and hypotheses tests. Study data quality and validity were assessed with the Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, and Significance (PREFS) quality checklist. Results We identified 2560 titles, 99 of which met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two-thirds of the studies focused on the preferences of patients and the general population. In total, 80% of the studies used discrete choice experiments. Studies used between three and 20 attributes, most commonly four to six. Sample size in LCAs ranged from 47 to 2068, with one-third between 100 and 300. Over 90% of the studies used latent class logit models for segmentation. Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and log-likelihood (LL) were commonly used for model selection, and class size and interpretability were also considered in some studies. About 80% of studies reported two to three classes. The number of classes reported was not correlated with any study characteristics or study population characteristics (p > 0.05). Only 30% of the studies reported using statistical tests to detect significant variations in preferences between classes. Less than half of the studies reported that individual characteristics were included in the segmentation models, and 30% reported that post-estimation analyses were conducted to examine class characteristics. While a higher percentage of studies discussed clinical implications of the segmentation results, an increasing number of studies proposed policy recommendations based on segmentation results since 2010. Conclusions LCA is increasingly used to study preference heterogeneity in health and support decision-making. However, there is little consensus on best practices as its application in health is relatively new. With an increasing demand to study preference heterogeneity, guidance is needed to improve the quality of applications of segmentation methods in health to support policy development and clinical practice.","[Zhou, Mo; Thayer, Winter Maxwell; Bridges, John F.

[Econometrica, 2000, 68, 1343-1376]. Our approach is based on the classic methodology of approximating a density function with an orthogonal expansion of polynomials weighted by a kernel. Orthogonal expansions based on the Gaussian distribution, such as Edgeworth or Gram-Charlier expansions, have been successfully employed by a number of authors in the context of equity options. However, these expansions are not quite suitable for volatility or variance densities as they inherently assign positive mass to the negative real line. Here we approximate option prices via expansions that instead are based on kernels defined on the positive real line. Specifically, we consider a flexible family of distributions, which generalizes the gamma kernel associated with the classic Laguerre expansions. The method can be employed whenever the moments of the underlying variance distribution are known. It provides fast and accurate price computations, and therefore it represents a valid and possibly more robust alternative to pricing techniques based on Fourier transform inversions.","[Barletta, Andrea; Nicolato, Elisa] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Nicolato, E (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",eln@econ.au.dk,,"Barletta, Andrea/0000-0002-8961-5495",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA [289032],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA(European Union (EU)),Andrea Barletta's research was supported by the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/ under REA [grant agreement no 289032].,,45,5,6,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We sought to review the economic costs and benefits of prescribed CBMs in any chronic illness, and the frameworks used for their economic evaluation. A systematic review of eight medical and economic databases, from inception to mid-December 2016, was undertaken. MeSH headings and text words relating to economic costs and benefits, and CBMs were combined. Study quality was assessed using relevant checklists and results were synthesised in narrative form. Of 2514 identified records, ten studies met the eligibility criteria, all for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Six contained economic evaluations, four studies reported utility-based quality of life, and one was a willingness-to-pay study. Four of five industry-sponsored cost-utility analyses for MS spasticity reported nabiximols as being cost-effective from a European health system perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for these five studies were A 49,257 pound (UK); A 10,891 pound (Wales); a,notsign11,214 (Germany); a,notsign4968 (Italy); and dominant (Spain). Nabiximols for the management of MS spasticity was not associated with statistically significant improvements in EQ-5D scores compared with standard care. Study quality was moderate overall, with limited inclusion of both relevant societal costs and discussions of potential bias. Prescribed CBMs are a potentially cost-effective add-on treatment for MS spasticity; however, this evidence is uncertain. Further investment in randomised trials with in-built economic evaluations is warranted for a wider range of clinical indications.

This article explicitly models this observed heterogeneity using a generalized model of endogenous ordered switching. Our approach captures the endogenous choice that credit unions make when adding new products to their financial services mix. The model that we consider also allows for the dependence between unobserved effects and regressors in both the selection and outcome equations and can accommodate the presence of predetermined covariates in the model. We use this model to estimate returns to scale for U.S. retail credit unions from 1996 to 2011. We document strong evidence of persistent technological heterogeneity among credit unions offering different financial service mixes, which, if ignored, can produce quite misleading results.

Finite-sample versions of the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter are described that can be used to implement the methods in a common way.The frequency-domain method, which is also implemented in the IDEOLOG program, employs an ideal frequency selective filter that depends on identifying the ordinates of the Fourier transform of a detrended data sequence that should lie in the pass band of the filter and those that should lie in its stop band.

Regularization is a statistical approach for avoiding over-parameterization, and it can reduce estimation and predictive variances compared to MLE. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, regularization is accomplished by the use of mean-zero priors, and the degree of parsimony can be optimized by numerically efficient out-of-sample cross-validation. This provides a consistent framework for comparing a variety of regularized MCMC models, such as those built with cubic splines, linear splines (as ours is), and the limiting case of non-regularized estimation.

More than one third of PC patients develop metastatic disease, and the 5-year expected survival in distant disease is about 35%. During the last few years, new treatments have been launched for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We aimed to review the current literature on health economic analysis on the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), compare the studies, summarize the findings and make the results available to administrators and decision makers. A systematic literature search was done for economic evaluations (cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-of-illness, cost-of-drug, and cost-benefit analyses). We employed the PubMed(A (R)) search engine and searched for publications published between 2012 and 2016. The terms used were prostate cancer, metastatic and cost. An initial screening of all headlines was performed, selected abstracts were analysed, and finally the full papers investigated. Study characteristics, treatment and comparator, country, type of evaluation, perspective, year of value, time horizon, efficacy data, discount rate, total costs and sensitivity analysis were analysed. The quality was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. A total of 227 publications were detected and screened, 58 selected for full-text assessment and 31 included in the final analyses. Despite the significant international literature on the treatment of mCRPC, there were only 15 studies focusing on cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Medical treatment constituted two thirds of the selected studies. Significant costs in the treatment of mCRPC were disclosed. In the pre-docetaxel setting, both abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide were concluded beyond accepted cost/quality-adjusted life year limits. In the docetaxel refractory setting, most studies concluded that enzalutamide was cost-effective and superior to AA. In most studies, cabazitaxel was not recommended, because of high cost. Looking at bone-targeting drugs, generic zoledronic acid (ZA) was recommended. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was analysed in three studies, and single fraction radiotherapy was concluded to be cost saving. Radium-223 was documented as beneficial, but costly. The quality of the studies was generally good, but sensitivity analyses, discounting and the measurement of health outcomes were present in less than two thirds of the selected studies. The treatment of mCRPC was associated with significant cost. In the post-docetaxel setting, single fraction radiotherapy and enzalutamide were considered cost-effective in most studies. Generic ZA was the recommended bone-targeting therapy.","[Norum, Jan] Finnmark Hosp Trust, Dept Surg, N-9600 Hammerfest, Norway; [Norum, Jan; Nieder, Carsten] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Clin Med, Fac Hlth Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Nieder, Carsten] Nordland Hosp, Dept Oncol & Palliat Med, N-8092 Bodo, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Norum, J (通讯作者)，Finnmark Hosp Trust, Dept Surg, N-9600 Hammerfest, Norway.;Norum, J (通讯作者)，UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Clin Med, Fac Hlth Sci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",jan.norum@helse-nord.no,,,,,,,59,40,40,0,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,12,,,,,1223,1236,,10.1007/s40273-017-0555-8,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FM8GP,28756597.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415324600003,0

When the losses of an insurer and a reinsurer are both measured by the Tail-Value-at-Risk (TVaR) risk measures, we obtain the explicit forms of the Pareto-optimal reinsurance contracts under the expected value premium principle. For the purpose of practice, we use numerical examples to show how to determine the mutually acceptable Pareto-optimal reinsurance contracts among the available Paretooptimal reinsurance contracts such that both the insurer's aim and the reinsurer's goal can be met under the mutually acceptable Pareto-optimal reinsurance contracts.

We condition individual decisions on wages, education, and an index of family attitudes. A match-specific, stochastic bliss shock induces variation in matching given wages, education, and family values, and triggers renegotiation and divorce. Using BHPS (1991-2008) data, we take as given changes in wages, education, and family values by gender, and study their impact on marriage decisions and intrahousehold resource allocation. The model allows to evaluate how much of the observed gender differences in labor supply results from wages, education, and family attitudes. We find that family attitudes are a strong determinant of comparative advantages in home production of men and women, whereas education complementarities induce assortative mating through preferences.","[Gousse, Marion] Laval Univ, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Jacquemet, Nicolas] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Jacquemet, Nicolas] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Robin, Jean-Marc] Sci Po, Dept Econ, CNRS, UMR8259, Paris, France; [Robin, Jean-Marc] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England",Laval University; Paris School of Economics; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); University of London; University College London,"Goussé, M (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",marion.gousse@ecn.ulaval.ca; nicolas.jacquemet@univ-paris1.fr,"Gousse, Marion/AAY-3194-2020; Jacquemet, Nicolas/F-4736-2010","Jacquemet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5056-9225; Gousse, Marion/0000-0003-2725-4521",ANR-GINDHILA; Institut Universitaire de France; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice [RES-589-28-0001]; European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2010-AdG-269693-WASP],ANR-GINDHILA(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Institut Universitaire de France; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We benefited from comments by Elizabeth Caucutt, Nicole Fortin, Pierre-Andre Chiappori, Bernard Fortin, Guy Lacroix, Costas Meghir, Rob Shimer, Edoardo Ciscato, as well as conference participants at Congres annuel de la Societe Canadienne de Sciences Economiques, Montebello, 2008, Annual CIRPEE Workshop, Mont-Orford, 2008, INED Workshop Recent advances in the economics of the household, Paris, 2010, ANR-Cemmap workshop Matching and sorting: theory and applications, Sciences-Po, Paris, 2010, ICREA-MOVE Conference on Family Economics, Autonoma Barcelona, 2011, Conference Economic analysis using linked employer and employee data: bringing together theory and empirics, Porto University, 2011, SED Annual Meeting, Gent, 2011, the 2015 joint SOLE-EALE Conference (where a version of this paper was presented during the Adam Smith lecture), and seminar participants at various seminars.

In this paper, we propose a time-varying coefficient (TVC) mortality model aiming to combine the good characteristics of existing models with efficient model calibration methods. Nonparametric kernel smoothing techniques have been applied in the literature of mortality modeling and based on the findings from Li et al:s (2015) study, such techniques can significantly improve the forecasting performance of mortality models. In this study we take the same path and adopt a kernel smoothing approach along the time dimension. Since we follow the model structure of the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (CBD) model, the TVC model we propose can be seen as a semi-parametric extension of the CBD model and it gives specific model design according to different countries' mortality experience. Our empirical study presented here includes Great Britain, the United States, and Australia amongst other developed countries. Fitting and forecasting results from the empirical study have shown superior performances of the model over a selection of well-known mortality models in the current literature.

Our objective was to identify and characterize publicly available cases and related trends for these arrangements. We performed a review of PBRSAs from 1993 to 2016 using the University of Washington PBRSA Database. Arrangements were categorized according to a previously published taxonomy. Macro-level trends were identified related to the timing of adoption, countries involved, types of arrangements, and disease areas. Our search yielded 437 arrangements. Among these, 183 (41.9%) were categorized as currently active, while 58.1% have expired. Five main types of arrangements have been identified, namely coverage with evidence development (149 cases, 34.1%), performance-linked reimbursement (104 cases, 23.8%), conditional treatment continuation (78 cases, 17.8%), financial or utilization (71 cases, 16.2%), and hybrid schemes with multiple components (35 cases, 8.0%). The pace of adoption varies across countries but has renewed an upward trend after a lull in 2012/2013. Conditions in the USA may be changing toward a more favorable environment of PBRSAs. Interest in PBRSAs remains high, suggesting they are a viable coverage and reimbursement mechanism for a wide range of medical products.","[Carlson, Josh J.; Chen, Shuxian; Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Carlson, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",carlsojj@u.washington.edu,,"Carlson, Josh J/0000-0001-7664-8370",,,,,26,62,68,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2017,35.0,10,,,,,1063,1072,,10.1007/s40273-017-0535-z,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FH7AR,28695544.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411333800007,0

We used a previously developed Markov model that evaluated the cost effectiveness of nine urate-lowering strategies: no treatment, allopurinol-only fixed dose (300 mg), allopurinol-only dose escalation (up to 800 mg), febuxostat-only fixed dose (80 mg), febuxostat-only dose escalation (up to 120 mg), allopurinol-febuxostat sequential therapy fixed dose, allopurinol-febuxostat sequential therapy dose escalation, febuxostat-allopurinol sequential therapy fixed dose, and febuxostat-allopurinol sequential therapy dose escalation. Each strategy was evaluated over the lifetime of a hypothetical gout patient. We calculated population expected value of perfect information (EVPI). We used a linear regression meta-modeling approach to calculate population expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI), and a Gaussian approximation to calculate the population expected value of sample information for parameters (EVSI) and the expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS) for four potential study designs: (1) an allopurinol efficacy trial; (2) a febuxostat efficacy trial; (3) a prospective observational study evaluating health utilities; and (4) a comprehensive study evaluating the efficacy of allopurinol and febuxostat and health utilities. A 5-year decision time horizon was used in the base-case analysis. EVPI varied by a decision maker's willingness-to-pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and was $US900 million for WTP of $US60,000 per QALY. Population EVPPI was highest across all WTP values for study design #4. For study design #4 and a WTP of $US60,000 per QALY, the optimal sample size was 735 patients per study arm. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of allopurinol and febuxostat dose escalation.","[Jutkowitz, Eric] Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Policy & Practice, 121 S Main St,6th Floor,Box G-S121-6, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Alarid-Escudero, Fernando; Kuntz, Karen M.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Choi, Hyon K.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Gout & Crystal Arthropathy Ctr,Clin Epidemiol & H, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Jalal, Hawre] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Brown University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Jutkowitz, E (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Policy & Practice, 121 S Main St,6th Floor,Box G-S121-6, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Eric_Jutkowitz@Brown.edu,"Alarid-Escudero, Fernando/D-7418-2018","Alarid-Escudero, Fernando/0000-0001-5076-1172; Jalal, Hawre/0000-0002-8224-6834",,,,,48,9,12,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2017,35.0,10,,,,,1073,1085,,10.1007/s40273-017-0526-0,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FH7AR,28631197.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411333800008,0

Colleges have strict preferences over sets of students and value money only to the extent that it allows them to enroll better or additional students. A student can attend at most one college and receive a stipend from it. Each student has preferences over college-stipend bundles. Although in the presence of budget constraints, the conditions that are essential for most of the results on stability in the literature fail, Abizada (Theor Econ 11(2), 735-756, 2016) shows that for this model a pairwise stable allocation always exists.

Estimation and inference are usually done via maximum likelihood. Although some progress has been made recently, a complete distribution theory of MLE for EGARCH models is still missing. Furthermore, the estimation procedure itself may be highly sensitive to starting values, the choice of numerical optimization algorithm, etc. We present an alternative estimator that is available in a simple closed form and which could be used, for example, as starting values for MLE. The estimator of the dynamic parameter is independent of the innovation distribution. For the other parameters we assume that the innovation distribution belongs to the class of Generalized Error Distributions (GED), profiling out its parameter in the estimation procedure.

Some monotonicity properties of the distribution function of the beta distribution are established which enable the derivation of an efficient algorithm for the implementation of the procedure. The methodology has important applications to financial risk management. Specifically, the analysis of loss given default (LGD) data are often modeled with a beta distribution. This new approach properly addresses model risk caused by inadequate sample sizes of LGD data, and can be used in conjunction with the standard recommendations provided by regulators to provide enhanced and more informative analyses.

We assume that the goal of each insurance company is to maximize its utility of the difference between its terminal surplus and that of its competitor at the terminal time T. Moreover, at the beginning of the game, two insurance companies acquire some information about the future realization of the claims process. However, they treat with it differently, since one company trusts it while its competitor does not. Our focus is to study how the companies are affected by this information. By utilizing the dynamic programming principle and the enlargement of filtration techniques, the existence of the Nash equilibrium solutions can be verified. For the exponential utility, we derive three kinds of the candidate forms for the equilibrium strategies in the special situations and also provide the numerical method for the general situation. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate how the reinsurance strategies change when the information level and other parameters vary. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that realized variance attains the efficiency bound for integrated variance under both regular and irregular sampling schemes. For estimating higher powers such as integrated quarticity, the block-based procedures of Mykland and Zhang (2009) can get arbitrarily close to the nonparametric bounds, when observation times are equidistant. Moreover, the estimator in Jacod and Rosenbaum (2013), whose efficiency was documented for the submodel assuming constant volatility, is efficient also for nonconstant volatility paths. When the observation times are possibly random but predictable, we provide an estimator, similar to that of Kristensen (2010), which can get arbitrarily close to the nonparametric bound. Finally, parametric information about the functional form of volatility leads to a lower efficiency bound, unless the volatility process is piecewise constant.","[Renault, Eric] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Sarisoy, Cisil; Werker, Bas J.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990). The social conflict game is a class of strategic games that includes the prisoners' dilemma and the chicken game. We first show that the stable set generally fails to exist in a system that is directly derived from the social conflict game. In this system, the stable set exists if and only if the strong equilibrium exists in the underlying game. If the stable set exists, it coincides with the set of the strong equilibria that is equivalent to the core for the system. Then, we turn to a modified system where the players are allowed to make commitments. In the system with commitments, the stable set always exists, and it consists of efficient outcomes with a certain property. We also discuss the relationship between the core and the stable set for the system with commitments.","[Hirai, Toshiyuki] Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Toyama, Japan",University of Toyama,"Hirai, T (通讯作者)，Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Toyama, Japan.",thirai@eco.u-toyama.ac.jp,,"Hirai, Toshiyuki/0000-0002-2230-4123","JSPS [22730155, 24310110]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730155, 26780118] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author is grateful to an associate editor, two anonymous reviewers, the participants of SING 9 and the seminar held at University of Naples, Federico II for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Our approach yields a coefficient which in many practical cases depends on the initial values of both the portfolio and its benchmark. It can also be used to take into account extreme risks and not only the variance. We study several classical diffusion processes and give a full analysis in the case of Jacobi processes.

However, microstructure theory states that trade duration, volume and transaction prices are simultaneously determined. We propose Lagrange-multiplier (LM) tests for weak exogeneity for the MEMs. Our LM tests are extensions of the weak exogeneity tests applicable to VAR or VECM models with Gaussian distributions. Empirical assessments show that (i) weak exogeneity is widely rejected by the data in the MEMs and (ii) the failure of weak exogeneity seriously biases parameter estimates.

The introduction of the family of Johnson distributions allows a better fit to empirical financial data. Additionally, this class can be extended to a quite general family of distributions by considering all possible regular transformations of the standard Gaussian distribution. In this framework, we consider the portfolio optimal positioning problem, which has been first addressed by Brennan and Solanki [J. Financial Quant. Anal., 1981, 16, 279-300], Leland [J.

We determine and analyse the optimal portfolio for log return having Johnson distributions. The solution is characterized for arbitrary utility functions and illustrated in particular for a CRRA utility. Our findings show how the profiles of financial structured products must be selected when taking account of non Gaussian log-returns.","[Naguez, N.] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA 33 Bd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Prigent, J.

As with conventional risk types, systemic risks need to be quantified. Currently, global regulators propose a range of bank-specific indicators that measure size and interconnectedness to proxy systemic risk. In this study, we gauge the capacity of such indicators to explain contagion losses triggered by realizations of sizeable idiosyncratic shocks. We study contagion impact through different channels, separating these effects into first-round, nth-round, asset fire sale and mark-to-market losses. We evaluate the predictive power of models selected by best-subset selection and Lasso by applying 10-fold panel cross validation. We provide constructive proofs for the existence of clearing payment vectors and associated market equilibria for these contagion channels in a model of interlinked balance sheets. We provide algorithms that converge to the greatest market equilibrium in a finite number of steps. Our empirical results suggest that the Basel III indicator set performs well in comparison to alternative data-sets of bank-specific indicators. We also find, however, that the proposed data-sets without bank dummies do not perform well in capturing the relevance of the average network position for predicting contagion effects.","[Siebenbrunner, Christoph] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Sigmund, Michael; Kerbl, Stefan] Oesterreich Natl Bank OeNB, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Oxford,"Siebenbrunner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",christoph.siebenbrunner@maths.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,80,12,12,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This problem is a variant of optimal transport (Monge-Kantorovich) between two measure spaces where one of the measures is discrete (capacities) and the costs of transport are the wisdoms of the agents. We concentrate on the individual value for each agent under optimal partition and show that, counter-intuitively, this value may decrease if the agent's wisdom is increased. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the monotonicity with respect to the wisdom functions of the individual values will be given, independently of the other agents. The sharpness of these conditions is also discussed.

The task will be to find stable assignments of agents to activities, for different concepts of stability such as Nash or core stability, and Pareto optimal assignments respectively. In this respect, particular focus is laid on two natural special cases of agents' preferences inherent in the considered model, namely increasing and decreasing preferences, where agents want to share an activity with as many (as few, respectively) agents as possible.","[Darmann, Andreas] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Darmann, A (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria.",andreas.darmann@uni-graz.at,,,University of Graz; University of Graz project Voting-Selection-Decision,University of Graz; University of Graz project Voting-Selection-Decision,"Open access funding provided by University of Graz.

Methods The research design and data collection followed a protocol developed by the EuroQol Group. The EuroQol Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) software was administered using computer-assisted personal interviews to a representative sample of adults resident in Ireland between 2015 and 2016. Utility values were elicited using two stated-preference techniques: time trade-off (TTO) and discrete-choice experiment (DCE). Each respondent completed a valuation exercise in which the EQ-VT system randomly selected one block of ten TTO questions from ten blocks relating to a possible 86 health states. One block of seven DCE pairs from 28 blocks of a possible 196 pairs of health states were randomly selected to accompany this. The relationship between utility values and health states was analysed using a hybrid regression model that combined data from the TTO and DCE techniques and expressed these as a function of the health state presented to the individual. This model estimated coefficients for 20 dummy variables that characterised each health state in the EQ-5D-5L framework, with the lowest level of severity providing the reference category in each domain. The relationship between weighted and unweighted TTO and DCE analyses of main effects was analysed separately. Results Comparison of weighted and unweighted models revealed no substantive differences in results with respect to either DCE or TTO models. The unweighted hybrid model produced estimated effects, the ordering of which was intuitively consistent within each domain: lower levels of health were associated with lower utility values. Differences were evident between domains with respect to valuations; the disutility associated with conditions related to anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort was higher than for other domains. The decrement in utility associated with movement from the highest to the lowest level of health was 0.344 for mobility, 0.287 for self-care, 0.187 for usual activities, 0.510 for pain/discomfort and 0.646 for anxiety/depression. Discussion The results present the first value set based on the EQ-5D-5L framework for a representative sample of residents in Ireland. The set reveals a higher decrement in utility associated with anxiety/depression than with other domains of health. Caution is warranted in comparisons with other value sets. That said, those in England, the Netherlands, Uruguay and China reveal that, whereas Irish values are broadly consistent with respect to mobility, self-care and usual activities, residents of Ireland attach a higher decrement to pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression than do other populations.","[Barry, Luke; Kelleher, Dan] NUI Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Galway, Ireland; [Shah, Koonal; Devlin, Nancy] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Goni, Juan Manuel Ramos] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hobbins, Anna; O'Neill, Ciaran] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Queens University Belfast,"O'Neill, C (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Publ Hlth, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",Ciaran.oneill@qub.ac.uk,"Kelleher, Dan P./JNT-6194-2023; Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; o'neill, ciaran/0000-0001-7668-3934; Hobbins, Anna/0000-0002-5532-3830",Health Research Board [RL/2013/16]; EuroQol Foundation; Health Research Board (HRB) [RL-2013-16] Funding Source: Health Research Board (HRB),Health Research Board; EuroQol Foundation; Health Research Board (HRB)(Health Research Board - Ireland),This study was funded by the Health Research Board under a Research Leader Award held by Ciaran O'Neill RL/2013/16.

The risk is measured by a so-called weighted value-at-risk (WVaR) risk measure, which is a generalization of both value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). The feasibility, well-posedness, and existence of the optimal solution are examined. We obtain the optimal solution (when it exists) and show how risk measures change asset allocation patterns. In particular, we characterize three classes of risk measures: the first class will lead to models that do not admit an optimal solution, the second class can give rise to endogenous portfolio insurance, and the third class, which includes VaR and ES, two popular regulatory risk measures, will allow economic agents to engage in regulatory capital arbitrage, incurring larger losses when losses occur.","[Wei, Pengyu] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Wei, Pengyu] Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst Quantitat Finance, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Wei, PY (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.;Wei, PY (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Man Inst Quantitat Finance, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",weip@maths.ox.ac.uk,"Wei, Pengyu/AAU-5392-2021","Wei, Pengyu/0000-0002-9738-2177",Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; Oxford-Nie Financial Big Data Lab,Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; Oxford-Nie Financial Big Data Lab,"I am grateful to helpful comments from Suleyman Basak, Hanqing Jin, Michael Monoyios, Xunyu Zhou, seminar participants at Oxford, as well as conference participants at the 10th Actuarial and Financial Mathematics Conference in Brussels.

Management of longevity risk has been an ongoing issue for insurance companies and pension funds who offer products with payout depending on the lifetime of policyholders. One of the major difficulties in pricing longevity instruments is the determination of a longevity risk-premium. This problem arises from the fact that the longevity market is illiquid and is considered to be incomplete. In this paper we provide an insight to the study of several pricing approaches for longevity instruments that have been proposed in the literature. To account for parameter uncertainty in mortality forecasts and longevity instruments pricing, our analysis hinges on a Bayesian state-space mortality model. The sampling-based Bayesian approach allows us to obtain a distribution of the longevity risk-premium, thus providing an alternative perspective in analyzing the pricing methods. We also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the considered pricing approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Missing data are, however, a common issue that can seriously undermine their validity. A major concern is that the chance of data being missing may be directly linked to the unobserved value itself [missing not at random (MNAR)]. For example, patients with poorer health may be less likely to complete quality-of-life questionnaires. However, the extent to which this occurs cannot be ascertained from the data at hand. Guidelines recommend conducting sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of conclusions to plausible MNAR assumptions, but this is rarely done in practice, possibly because of a lack of practical guidance. This tutorial aims to address this by presenting an accessible framework and practical guidance for conducting sensitivity analysis for MNAR data in trial-based CEA. We review some of the methods for conducting sensitivity analysis, but focus on one particularly accessible approach, where the data are multiply-imputed and then modified to reflect plausible MNAR scenarios. We illustrate the implementation of this approach on a weight-loss trial, providing the software code. We then explore further issues around its use in practice.","[Leurent, Baptiste; Carpenter, James R.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Gomes, Manuel; Morris, Stephen] UCL, Dept Appl Hlth Res, London, England; [Faria, Rita] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Grieve, Richard] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Carpenter, James R.] UCL, MRC, Clin Trials Unit, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; University College London; University of York - UK; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; University of London; University College London,"Leurent, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",baptiste.leurent@lshtm.ac.uk,"Faria, Rita/H-3198-2019","Faria, Rita/0000-0003-3410-1435; Gomes, Manuel/0000-0002-1428-1232; fattahi, elahe/0000-0002-8626-9566; Grieve, Richard/0000-0001-8899-1301; Morris, Stephen/0000-0002-5828-3563; Leurent, Baptiste/0000-0001-6420-6567; Carpenter, James/0000-0003-3890-6206","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-12437, SRF-2013-06-016]; NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust; Medical Research Council (MRC) [MC_UU_12023/21]; MRC [MC_UU_12023/21] Funding Source: UKRI",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust; Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This report is independent research supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (Doctoral Research Fellowship, B.

Given the relatively high costs of biological therapies, cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) may be required as a prerequisite for coverage and reimbursement. Objective We aimed to systematically review published literature on the economic impact of biological asthma therapies and to identify key drivers that impact cost-effectiveness in order to provide recommendations for future economic evaluations. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar. We included studies that assessed the cost-effectiveness of asthma biologics and were published in English between 2000 and 2018. The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument was used to evaluate quality. Results Twenty asthma biological CEAs were identified. Nineteen studies analyzed the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab, and one study analyzed mepolizumab. Ten studies concluded that omalizumab was cost-effective in base-case scenarios, four studies concluded omalizumab was not cost-effective, and the remaining studies concluded omalizumab or mepolizumab was cost-effective only when targeted to specific severe subgroups or given considerable price discounts. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included day-to-day health-related quality of life (HRQoL), asthma-related mortality, acquisition price of the biological therapy, and time horizon. Conclusions Most studies recommended carefully targeting biological therapy to specific populations such as responders or discounting acquisition price in order to further improve value. The quality of the studies was generally satisfactory, but improved evidence is needed linking HRQoL to utilities as well as understanding interventions' impact on asthma-related mortality. Key recommendations from this review may allow for greater comparability across future cost-effectiveness studies.","[McQueen, R.

The MM has access to a risk-free asset, a bond and a stock in a financial market. We assume that the interest rate is described by an affine model, which includes the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model and the Vasicek model as special cases, while the stock price is driven by the Heston's stochastic volatility model. Moreover, the MM has different levels of ambiguity aversion about the diffusion parts of the interest rate and the stock's price and volatility. She attempts to maximize the expected power utility of her terminal wealth under the worst-case scenario. By applying the stochastic dynamic programming approach, we derive a robust optimal investment strategy and the corresponding value function explicitly, and subsequently two special cases are discussed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the impact of model parameters on the robust optimal investment strategy and to explain the economic meaning of our theoretical results. The numerical example shows that the AAM's ambiguity aversion levels about the interest rate and the stock's price and volatility have different impacts on the proportions invested in the risky assets, and that ignoring model uncertainty always incurs utility losses for the MM.

One of the most common sites of metastasis is the bone, with several therapeutic options currently available for managing bone metastases. In a resource-constrained environment, policy makers and practitioners need to know which options are cost effective. The aim of this systematic review was to review and appraise published economic evaluations on treatments for the management of bone metastases. We searched eight bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CSDR, DARE, HTA, EED and CPCI) for relevant economic evaluations published from each database's inception date until March 2017. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were carried out according to published guidelines. Twenty-four relevant economic analyses were identified. Seventeen of these studies focused on bone metastases resulting from a particular type of cancer, i.e. prostate (n = 8), breast (n = 7), lung (n = 1) or renal (n = 1), while seven report results for various primary tumours. Across types of cancer, evidence suggests that bisphosphonates result in lower morbidity and improved quality of life, for an additional cost, which is typically below conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. While denosumab leads to health gains compared with zoledronic acid, it also results in substantial additional costs and is unlikely to represent value for money. The limited literature on the radiopharmaceutical strontium-89 (Sr89) and external beam radiotherapy (EBR) suggest that these treatments are cost effective compared with no treatment. The reviewed evidence suggests that bisphosphonate treatments are cost-effective options for bone metastases, while denosumab is unlikely to represent value for money. Evidence on EBR and Sr89 is limited and less conclusive.","[Andronis, Lazaros; Goranitis, Ilias] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Andronis, Lazaros] Univ Warwick, Div Hlth Sci, Populat Evidence & Technol Grp, Off A 103, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Bayliss, Sue] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Duarte, Rui] Univ Liverpool, Dept Hlth Serv Res, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Birmingham; University of Warwick; University of Birmingham; University of Liverpool,"Andronis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Andronis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Div Hlth Sci, Populat Evidence & Technol Grp, Off A 103, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",l.andronis@warwick.ac.uk,"Duarte, Rui/C-9635-2012","Duarte, Rui/0000-0001-6485-7415; Andronis, Lazaros/0000-0001-7998-7431",,,,,67,11,12,0,13,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,301,322,,10.1007/s40273-017-0595-0,0.0,,,22,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29224174.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800005,0

MS is considered incurable; however, disease treatment has advanced significantly over the past several decades with the introduction of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The current study reviewed the cost-effectiveness analyses of DMTs in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. Methods A systematic literature search of bibliographic databases was conducted to identify economic evaluations published after 2007. The relevant population, intervention, comparators, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) were considered. The outcomes of interest were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), net monetary benefits, incremental benefits, and incremental costs. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement was used to assess the reporting quality of published studies. Results A total of 1370 potentially relevant citations were identified, of which 33 published articles and four Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports prepared for the UK were included in the final analysis. Almost all studies were based on a health economic model and considered RRMS as the phase of disease at study entry. The studies were conducted in 10 different countries, with approximately 50% based in the US. Study outcomes were rarely comparable due to the different settings, input data, and assumptions. Even within the same country, the discrepancy between study criteria was considerable. The compliance with reporting standards of the CHEERS statement was generally high. Conclusions Internationally, a large number of health economic assessments of DMTs in RRMS were available, yielding difficult to compare, and at times conflicting, results.","[Iannazzo, Sergio] IMAC, Via Caboto 45, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Iliza, Ange-Christelle; Perrault, Louise] IMAC, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Iliza, Ange-Christelle] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Iliza, Ange-Christelle] Hosp Ctr Univ Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Iannazzo, S (通讯作者)，IMAC, Via Caboto 45, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",sergio.iannazzo@icloud.com,,,,,,,58,23,26,0,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2018,36.0,2,,,,,189,204,,10.1007/s40273-017-0577-2,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FV6LA,29032493.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424691300006,0

Our study gives a closed-form expression for a regime-switching pairs trading value function consisting of probability and expectation of the double boundary stopping time of the Markov-modulated O-U process. We derive analytic solutions for the homogenous and non-homogenous ODE systems with initial value conditions for probability and expectation of the double boundary stopping time, and translate the solutions with boundary value conditions into solutions with initial value conditions. Based on the smoothness and continuity of the value function, we can obtain the optimum of the value function with thresholds and guarantee the existence of optimal thresholds in a finite closed interval. Our numerical analysis illustrates the rationality of theoretical model and the shape of transition probability and expected stopping time, as well as discusses sensitivity analysis in both one-state and two-state regime-switching models. We find that the optimal expected return per unit time in the two-state regime-switching model is higher than that of one-state regime-switching model. Likewise, the regime-switching model's optimal thresholds are closer and more symmetric to the long-term mean.","[Bai, Yang] Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wu, Lan] Peking Univ, Key Lab Math Econ & Quantitat Finance, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Wu, L (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Key Lab Math Econ & Quantitat Finance, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",lwu@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,47,12,12,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

To evaluate our procedure, we compare baseline and option augmented monthly density forecasts for the S&P 500 index over the period 1997-2013.

From a financial point of view, Orlicz risk measures assess the stochastic nature of returns, in contrast to the common use of risk measures to assess the stochastic nature of a position's monetary value. The correspondence with shortfall risk leads to several robustified versions of Orlicz risk measures, and of their optimized translation invariant extensions (Rockafellar and Uryasev in J Risk 2:21-42, 2000, Goovaerts et al. in Insur Math Econ 34:505-516, 2004), arising from an ambiguity averse approach as in Gilboa and Schmeidler (J Math Econ 18:141-153, 1989), Maccheroni et al.

Our main goal is to link performance and the stochastic process of the traded asset. Our study reports short-, medium- and long-term effects by looking at the Sharpe ratio (SR). We calculate the Sharpe ratio of our trading rule as a function of the probability distribution function of the underlying traded asset and compare it with data. We show that if the performance is mainly due to presence of autocorrelation in the returns of the traded assets, the SR as a function of the portfolio formation period (look-back) is very different from performance due to the drift (average return). The SR shows that for look-back periods of a few months the investor is more likely to tap into autocorrelation. However, for look-back larger than few months, the drift of the asset becomes progressively more important. Finally, our empirical work reports a new long-term effect, namely oscillation of the SR and proposes a non-stationary model to account for such oscillations.","[Ferreira, Fernando F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Complex Syst, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Silva, A.

Mortality risk is introduced to the valuation framework by incorporating a two-factor affine stochastic mortality model proposed in Blackburn and Sherris (2013). The paper considers both, static and dynamic policyholder withdrawal behaviour associated with GMWB riders and assesses how model parameters influence the fees levied on providing such guarantees. Our numerical experiments reveal that the GMWB fees are very sensitive to regime-switching parameters; a percentage increase in the force of interest results in significant decrease in guarantee fees. The guarantee fees increase substantially with increasing volatility levels. Numerical experiments also highlight an increasing importance of mortality as maturity of the VA contract increases. Mortality has less impact on shorter maturity contracts regardless of the policyholder's withdrawal behaviour. As much as mortality influences pricing results for long maturities, the associated guarantee fees are decreasing functions of maturities for the VA contracts. Robustness checks of the Fourier Space Time-Stepping algorithm are performed by making numerical comparisons with several existing valuation approaches.","[Ignatieva, Katja] Univ New South Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Song, Andrew] Taylor Fry Analyt & Actuarial Consulting, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Ziveyi, Jonathan] Univ New South Wales, CEPAR, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Ziveyi, J (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, CEPAR, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",k.ignatieva@unsw.edu.au; sinan418@hotmail.com; j.ziveyi@unsw.edu.au,"Ignatieva, Katja/W-8813-2019","Ignatieva, Katja/0000-0001-7472-5475",,,,,39,13,13,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2018,48.0,1,,,,,139,169,,10.1017/asb.2017.23,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FT3FK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423032500007,0

It is well known that ignoring the sample selectivity may result in inconsistency of the estimator due to the correlation between the statistical errors in the selection and main equations. In this article, we reconsider the maximum likelihood estimator for the panel sample selection model in Keane et al. (1988). Since the panel data model contains individual effects, such as fixed or random effects, the likelihood function is more complicated than that of the classical Heckman model. As an alternative to the existing derivation of the likelihood function in the literature, we show that the conditional distribution of the main equation follows a closed skew-normal (CSN) distribution, of which the linear transformation is still a CSN. Although the evaluation of the likelihood function involves high-dimensional integration, we show that the integration can be further simplified into a one-dimensional problem and can be evaluated by the simulated likelihood method. Moreover, we also conduct a Monte Carlo experiment to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator and find that our estimator provides reliable and quite satisfactory results.","[Lai, Hung-Pin] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Tsay, Wen-Jen] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Lai, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",ecdhpl@ccu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China [NSC101-2410-H-194-017],"Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Lai gratefully acknowledges the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China (NSC101-2410-H-194-017) for research support.,,28,1,1,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Through analysis of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we find that a large number of variables provide useful information for predicting stock market behaviors.","[Ohno, Saburo] Amundi Japan Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Ando, Tomohiro] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Keio University,"Ohno, S (通讯作者)，Amundi Japan Ltd, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",saburo.ohno@jp.amundi.com,,,"Seimeikai Foundation, Japan","Seimeikai Foundation, Japan","This research was partially supported by a grant from the Seimeikai Foundation, Japan.",,69,6,6,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

History dependent impact models,QUANTITATIVE FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Market microstructure; Price formation; Market impact model; Liquidity modelling,MARKET; TRADES; BOOK; TIME,"Market impact is a key concept in the study of financial markets and several models have been proposed in the literature so far. The propagator model posits that the price at high frequency time scales is a linear combination of the signs of the past executed market orders, weighted by a so-called propagator function. This model needs to be extended since prices are a priori influenced not only by the past order flow, but also by the past realization of returns themselves. In this paper, we propose a two-event framework, where price-changing and non price-changing events are considered separately. We show that two-event propagator models provide a remarkable improvement of the description of the market impact, especially for large tick stocks, where the events of price changes are very rare and very informative. Specifically the extended approach captures the excess anti-correlation between past returns and subsequent order flow which is missing in one-event models.","[Taranto, Damian Eduardo; Lillo, Fabrizio] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo; Lillo, Fabrizio] Univ Bologna, Dept Math, Piazza Porta San Donato 5, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe; Toth, Bence] Capital Fund Management, 23-25 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; University of Bologna,"Taranto, DE (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",damian.taranto@sns.it,,"Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505",,,,,26,11,11,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Nevertheless, a robust review of the literature is required to ensure that the health state utility values (HSUVs) used in the economic model are the most appropriate available. This article provides a synopsis of literature relating to identifying, reviewing and synthesising HSUVs. The process begins with scoping the needs of the economic model, including the definitions of health states and the requirements of any reimbursement agencies. A sequence of searches may be required as the economic model evolves. The terminology used for HRQoL measures may be problematic, and as there is no robust HRQoL filter [equivalent to that applied for randomised control trial (RCTs)], sifting the results of sensitive searches can be resource intensive. Alternative approaches such as forward and backward citation searches may reduce the resources required, while maintaining the integrity of the search. Any included studies should be assessed in terms of quality using a recommended checklist, and insufficient detail in the primary studies should be noted as a short-coming in this exercise. Subject to homogeneity (similar populations, same measure and preference weights) evidence can be pooled in some way, although methodological research into the appropriateness of alternative techniques for meta-analysis is in its infancy. Reporting standards are key and as a minimum should include details on searches, inclusion/exclusion criteria (together with rationale for exclusion at each stage), assessment of quality and relevance of included studies, and justification for the choice of final HSUVs.","[Ara, Roberta; Brazier, John; Peasgood, Tessa; Paisley, Suzy] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Peasgood, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",t.peasgood@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Peasgood, Tessa/0000-0001-8024-7801",Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd),This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,16,26,26,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S43,S55,,10.1007/s40273-017-0547-8,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052156.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400007,0

The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimate expected value of perfect information but not partial expected value of perfect information (owing to computational expense associated with typical methodologies). The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility and utility of estimating partial expected value of perfect information via a computationally efficient, non-parametric regression approach. This was a retrospective analysis of evaluations on drugs for cancer that had been submitted to the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (January 2010 to December 2014 inclusive). Drugs were excluded if cost effective at the submitted price. Drugs were excluded if concerns existed regarding the validity of the applicants' submission or if cost-effectiveness model functionality did not allow required modifications to be made. For each included drug (n = 14), value of information was estimated at the final reimbursement price, at a threshold equivalent to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at that price. The expected value of perfect information was estimated from probabilistic analysis. Partial expected value of perfect information was estimated via a non-parametric approach. Input parameters with a population value at least a,notsign1 million were identified as potential targets for research. All partial estimates were determined within minutes. Thirty parameters (across nine models) each had a value of at least a,notsign1 million. These were categorised. Collectively, survival analysis parameters were valued at a,notsign19.32 million, health state utility parameters at a,notsign15.81 million and parameters associated with the cost of treating adverse effects at a,notsign6.64 million. Those associated with drug acquisition costs and with the cost of care were valued at a,notsign6.51 million and a,notsign5.71 million, respectively. This research demonstrates that the estimation of partial expected value of perfect information via this computationally inexpensive approach could be considered feasible as part of the health technology assessment process for reimbursement purposes within the Irish healthcare system. It might be a useful tool in prioritising future research to decrease decision uncertainty.","[McCullagh, Laura; Barry, Michael] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Dublin, Ireland; [McCullagh, Laura; Schmitz, Susanne; Barry, Michael] St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin, Ireland; [Schmitz, Susanne] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ & Evidence Synth Res Unit, Strassen, Luxembourg; [Walsh, Cathal] Univ Limerick, Hlth Res Inst, Limerick, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; Luxembourg Institute of Health; University of Limerick,"McCullagh, L (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Dublin, Ireland.;McCullagh, L (通讯作者)，St James Hosp, Natl Ctr Pharmacoecon, Dublin, Ireland.",mcculllm@tcd.ie,"McCullagh, Laura/HOF-9342-2023; Schmitz, Susanne/K-8854-2019; Walsh, Chloe/AAM-1093-2020","Barry, Michael/0000-0002-6232-3003; McCullagh, Laura/0000-0001-8342-8739; Walsh, Cathal/0000-0001-6599-9562",Health Research Board Research Leader Award [RL2013/04],Health Research Board Research Leader Award(Health Research Board - Ireland),CW was supported by the Health Research Board RL2013/04 Research Leader Award.,,29,2,3,1,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2017,35.0,11,,,,,1177,1185,,10.1007/s40273-017-0552-y,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FK9WZ,28770453.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413863900007,0

A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database to identify trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations in obstetrics and gynaecology published between January 1, 2000 and May 16, 2017. Studies performed in middle- and low-income countries and studies related to prevention, midwifery, and reproduction were excluded. Reporting quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard (CHEERS) statement (a modified version with 21 items, as we focused on trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations) and the statistical quality was assessed using a literature-based list of criteria (8 items). Exploratory regression analyses were performed to assess the association between reporting and statistical quality scores and publication year. The electronic search resulted in 5482 potentially eligible studies. Forty-five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 22 in obstetrics and 23 in gynaecology. Twenty-seven (60%) studies did not adhere to 50% (n = 10) or more of the reporting quality items and 32 studies (71%) did not meet 50% (n = 4) or more of the statistical quality items. As for the statistical quality, no study used the appropriate method to assess cost differences, no advanced methods were used to deal with missing data, and clustering of data was ignored in all studies. No significant improvements over time were found in reporting or statistical quality in gynaecology, whereas in obstetrics a significant improvement in reporting and statistical quality was found over time. The focus of this review was on trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations in obstetrics and gynaecology, so further research is needed to explore whether results from this review are generalizable to other medical disciplines. The reporting and analysis of trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations in gynaecology and obstetrics is generally poor. Since this can result in biased results, incorrect conclusions, and inappropriate healthcare decisions, there is an urgent need for improvement in the methods of cost-effectiveness evaluations in this field.","[El Alili, Mohamed; van Dongen, Johanna M.; van Tulder, Maurits W.; Bosmans, Judith E.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Hlth Sci, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Amsterdam Publ Hlth Res Inst, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huirne, Judith A.

In such situations, naturally, the classical Pearson correlation coefficient is of little use. On the other hand, it has been observed that when light-tailed situations are of interest, and hence when both the Gini-type and Pearson correlation coefficients are well defined and finite, these coefficients are related and sometimes even coincide. In general, understanding how these correlation coefficients are related has been an illusive task. In this paper, we put forward arguments that establish such a connection via certain regression-type equations. This, in turn, allows us to introduce a Gini-type weighted insurance pricing model that works in heavy-tailed situations and thus provides a natural alternative to the classical capital asset pricing model. We illustrate our theoretical considerations using several bivariate distributions, such as elliptical and those with heavy-tailed Pareto margins.","[Furman, Edward] York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Zitikis, Ricardas] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",York University - Canada; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Furman, E (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",efurman@mathstat.yorku.ca; zitikis@stats.uwo.ca,,,CAS,CAS(Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO)Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We are indebted to two anonymous referees for their very thorough readings of the paper, and the many suggestions that resulted in a major revision of the original submission.

This framework can be used to derive a wide range of non-Gaussian time series models with time varying coefficients and has shown to be very successful in financial applications. In this paper we propose five probability models (Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, Gaussian and beta) based on the GAS framework to estimate the Lee-Carter parameters and dynamically forecast the mortality rates using a single unified step. The models are applied to the mortality rates time series for the male population of the United States, Sweden, Japan and the UK. Diagnostic tests are performed on quantile residuals, model selection is made via AIC and predictive accuracy of the models is compared using the Diebold-Mariano test. We conclude that, amongst the proposed models, the negative binomial extension of the Lee-Carter model is the most appropriate for forecasting mortality rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we consider a setting in which in each period, the pension fund's investment and indexation policy is the outcome of a bargaining process between representatives of the then living generations. Because some generations might be under- or overrepresented in the board, we use the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution to allow for differences in bargaining powers. In a numerical study, we compare the welfare that the generations derive from the outcome of this repeated bargaining to the welfare that they would derive if a social planner's optimal policy would instead be implemented. We find that as compared to the social optimum, older generations benefit substantially from the repeated bargaining, even if all generations are equally well-represented in the board. If older generations are relatively over-represented, as is sometimes argued, these effects are attenuated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This so-calledWeissman estimator allows tests to be applied for extreme VaR, where extant tests mostly fail. In view of applications, we allow for weakly dependent observations. Our test statistics rely on self-normalization, which obviates the need to estimate the complicated asymptotic variance. Consistency is shown under local alternatives, where multiple breaks can occur. A simulation study shows that in finite samples our tests compare favourably in the tail region with extant tests based on order statistic estimators and also with tail index break tests.

The literature was reviewed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the four principal methods of cost determination: micro-costing, activity-based costing, charge-based costing, and gross costing. A scoping review was conducted to identify key trends in healthcare delivery and to identify costing issues associated with these changes. Existing guidelines provide information on how to implement various costing methods. Bottom-up costing is needed when accuracy is paramount, but top-down approaches are often the only feasible approach. We describe six healthcare trends that have important implications for costing methodology: (1) reform in payment mechanisms; (2) care delivery in less restrictive settings; (3) the growth of telehealth interventions; (4) the proliferation of new technology; (5) patient privacy concerns; and (6) growing efforts to implement guidelines. Some costs are difficult to measure and have been overlooked. These include physician services for inpatients, facility costs for outpatient services, the cost of developing treatment innovations, patient and caregiver costs, and the indirect costs of organizational interventions. Standardized methods are needed to determine social welfare and productivity costs. In the future, cost determination will be facilitated by technological advances but hindered by the shift to capitated payment, to the provision of care in less restrictive settings, and by heightened concern for medical record privacy.","[Jacobs, Josephine C.; Barnett, Paul G.] VA Hlth Econ Resource Ctr, 795 Willow Rd 152, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Barnett, Paul G.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hlth Res & Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Jacobs, JC (通讯作者)，VA Hlth Econ Resource Ctr, 795 Willow Rd 152, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",josephine.jacobs@va.gov,,,,,,,80,28,33,0,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2017,35.0,2,,,,,129,139,,10.1007/s40273-016-0465-1,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EJ3LU,27838912.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393114500001,0

Such conditions arise when estimation is based on moment conditions that are valid and can be divided into two subsets: one that identifies the parameters and another that provides no further information. Their framework highlights an important concept in the moment-based estimation literature, namely, that not all valid moment conditions need be informative about the parameters of interest. In this article, we demonstrate the empirical relevance of the concept in the context of the impact of government health expenditure on health outcomes in England. Using a simulation study calibrated to this data, we perform a comparative study of the finite performance of inference procedures based on the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) and info-metric (IM) estimators. The results indicate that the properties of GMM procedures deteriorate as the number of redundant moment conditions increases; in contrast, the IM methods provide reliable point estimators, but the performance of associated inference techniques based on first order asymptotic theory, such as confidence intervals and overidentifying restriction tests, deteriorates as the number of redundant moment conditions increases. However, for IM methods, it is shown that bootstrap procedures can provide reliable inferences; we illustrate such methods when analysing the impact of government health expenditure on health outcomes in England.","[Andrews, Martyn; Elamin, Obbey; Hall, Alastair R.; Kyriakoulis, Kostas; Sutton, Matthew] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kyriakoulis, Kostas; Sutton, Matthew] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC USA; [Elamin, Obbey] British Univ Egypt, Cairo, Egypt",University of Manchester; North Carolina State University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); British University in Egypt,"Hall, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alastair.hall@manchester.ac.uk,"Elamin, Obbey/C-9225-2018","Elamin, Obbey/0000-0002-2883-9815; Sutton, Matt/0000-0002-6635-2127",National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research Methods Funding Scheme; National Institute for Health Research [RMOFS 09-12] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research Methods Funding Scheme; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This work was performed as part of a project titled Towards Improved Inferences in Health Economics Analyses Using Moment-Based Econometric Methods supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research Methods Funding Scheme.,,27,25,25,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Various model specifications fall under this general approach based on defining the credit-quality process as an innovative time-change of a standard Brownian motion where the volatility process is mean reverting Levy driven OU type process. Our models are bottom-up and can account for sudden moves in the level of CDS spreads representing the so-called credit gap risk. We develop FFT computational tools for calculating the distribtition of losses and we show how to apply them to several specifications of the time-changed Brownian motion.

A logistic function with the product of one-step-ahead expectations of return and volume as a transition variable is used to depict the time-varying weight of a mixture copula. This paper then employs a mixture copula of a Gumbel copula and a rotated Gumbel copula to detect the asymmetric V-type pattern and uses a mixture copula of a Gumbel copula and a survival Gumbel copula to measure the asymmetric increasing-type pattern. Empirical results demonstrate that the asymmetric V-type pattern is a more appropriate specification to characterize the return-volume nexus than the asymmetric increasing-type pattern, irrespective of the types of energy-related futures products and futures exchanges. The time-varying dependence has greater dependence in the lower-upper corner of the joint distribution than in the upper-upper corner of the joint distribution, implying that market participants believe that market reversals are more likely during periods of price declines than in periods of price increases. Moreover, this paper shows the inappropriateness of the two-step estimation method that has been widely used in the existing literature.","[Chang, Kuang-Liang] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan; [Yu, Shih-Ti] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; National Tsing Hua University,"Chang, KL (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan.",klchang@mail.ncyu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 103-2410-H-415-003],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Kuang-Liang Chang acknowledges financial support from Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 103-2410-H-415-003).,,41,2,2,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Limiting distributions of these tests are derived under a sequence of local alternatives, and analytic expressions show how their means and variances are functions of the break date and the time dimension of the panel. The considered tests have nontrivial local power in a N-1/2 neighborhood of unity when the panel data model includes individual intercepts. For panel data models with incidental trends, the power of the tests becomes trivial in this neighborhood. However, this problem does not always appear if the tests allow for serial correlation in the error term and completely vanishes in the presence of cross-section correlation. These results show that fixed-T tests have very different theoretical properties than their large-T counterparts.

So far, however, limited research effort has been devoted on the development process of innovative services within cultural and creative industries and particularly Museums. Given the crucial importance of cultural organisations for the dynamic cultural and creative industries, this research work aims at studying the development of new innovative services in the Museums of Athens and their ability and capacity to adopt innovation management (i.e., development, organisational, functional and technological aspects of management) as the basic strategy for diversification. To achieve this task, a systematic desk-top research took place in order to identify and analyse models, practices and processes available on the design and development of new services. Based on the results of this work, a survey was designed aiming to identify the current status with regards to innovative services development and innovation management within Athenian Museums. The fieldwork was carried out in 62 museums in Athens and investigated the development process of 184 different services. The analysis was based on data collected via an in depth structured interview with questionnaires from museum directors knowledgeable about new service development in their organisation. A multicriteria methodology was used to examine the potential of a predictive model for successful new service development projects in the cultural industry.","[Kitsios, Fotis] Univ Macedonia, Sch Informat Sci, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Champipi, Eleni] Hellen Open Univ, Cultural Org Management, Patras, Greece; [Grigoroudis, Evangelos] Tech Univ Crete, Decis Support Syst Lab, Khania, Greece",University of Macedonia; Hellenic Open University; Technical University of Crete,"Kitsios, F (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Sch Informat Sci, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece.",kitsios@uom.gr; lenahabipi@yahoo.gr; vangelis@ergasya.tuc.gr,"Kitsios, Fotis C./B-2286-2017; Grigoroudis, Evangelos/D-7716-2013","Kitsios, Fotis C./0000-0001-7269-5567; Grigoroudis, Evangelos/0000-0001-8613-9350",,,,,39,1,1,3,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-33003-7; 978-3-319-33001-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,69,84,,10.1007/978-3-319-33003-7_4,0.0,,,16,"Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BI0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405341000004,0

There are currently few methods that are specifically adapted for efficient option risk measurement. Moreover, current methods rely on series approximations and incur significant model risks, which inhibit their applicability for risk management. In this paper we propose a new approach to computationally efficient option risk measurement, using the idea of a replicating portfolio and coherent risk measurement. We find our approach to option risk measurement provides fast computation by practically eliminating nonlinear computational operations. We reduce model risk by eliminating calibration and implementation risks by using mostly observable data, we remove internal model risk for complex option portfolios by not admitting arbitrage opportunities, we are also able to incorporate liquidity or model misspecification risks. Additionally, our method enables tractable and convex optimisation of portfolios containing multiple options. We conduct numerical experiments to test our new approach and they validate it over a range of option pricing parameters. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, estimating the standard error of these estimators is often challenging. The root of the problem is that traditionally, standard errors rely on estimating a theoretically derived asymptotic variance, and often this asymptotic variance involves substantially more complex quantities than the original parameter to be estimated. Standard errors are important: they are used to assess the precision of estimators in the form of confidence intervals, to create feasible statistics for testing, to build forecasting models based on, say, daily estimates, and also to optimize the tuning parameters. The contribution of this paper is to provide an alternative and general solution to this problem, which we call Observed Asymptotic Variance. It is a general nonparametric method for assessing asymptotic variance (AVAR). It provides consistent estimators of AVAR for a broad class of integrated parameters Theta = integral theta(t) dt, where the spot parameter process. can be a general semimartingale, with continuous and jump components. The observed AVAR is implemented with the help of a two-scales method. Its construction works well in the presence of microstructure noise, and when the observation times are irregular or asynchronous in the multivariate case. The methodology is valid for a wide variety of estimators, including the standard ones for variance and covariance, and also for more complex estimators, such as, of leverage effects, high frequency betas, and semivariance.","[Mykland, Per A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, 5747 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhang, Lan] Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, 601 South Morgan St,Mc 168, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Chicago; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Mykland, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, 5747 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",mykland@pascal.uchicago.edu; lanzhang@uic.edu,,"Mykland, Per/0009-0007-0101-5772","National Science Foundation [SES 11-24526, DMS 14-07812, DMS 14-07820]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1407820] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1407812, 1713129] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We would like to thank Ole Barndorff-Nielsen, Dachuan Chen, Jean Jacod, Eric Renault, Mathieu Rosenbaum, Olivier Scaillet, Neil Shephard, Kevin Sheppard, Christina D.

Tail risk is limited, with maximum drawdown at 6.57%. The high returns can only partially be explained by common sources of systematic risk. We benchmark the vine copula strategy against other variants relying on the multivariate Gaussian and t-distribution and we find its results to be superior in terms of risk and return characteristics.

On the other hand, the algorithm proposed by Knuth is a decentralized algorithm. In this article, we discuss conditions leading to the convergence of Knuth's decentralized algorithm. In particular, we show that Knuth's decentralized algorithm converges to a stable matching if either the Sequential Preference Condition (SPC) holds or if the market admits no cycle. In fact, acyclicity turns out to be a special case of SPC. We then consider markets where agents may prefer to remain single rather than being matched with someone. We introduce a generalized version of SPC for such markets. Under this notion of generalized SPC, we show that the market admits a unique stable matching, and that Knuth's decentralized algorithm converges. The generalized SPC seems to be the most general condition available in the literature for uniqueness in two-sided matching markets.","[Ramani, Vinay] Mohanlal Sukhadia Univ Campus, Indian Inst Management Udaipur, Udaipur 313001, India; [Rao, K.

Within this submission, they reported evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of etelcalcetide for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis. The Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC), part of the Wessex Institute at the University of Southampton, was the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) commissioned to appraise the company's submission. This article describes the ERG's review and critique of the company's submission and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (issued in June 2017). The clinical-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company consisted of two double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing etelcalcetide with placebo, one RCT comparing etelcalcetide with cinacalcet, two single-arm extension studies of the above trials, and one single-arm study evaluating the effect of switching from cinacalcet to etelcalcetide. No study specifically examined the population specified in the NICE appraisal scope: patients refractory to standard therapy with phosphate binders and vitamin D (PBVD). None of these trials were designed to collect long-term efficacy data for outcomes such as mortality, bone fractures, cardiovascular events, or parathyroidectomies. Instead, biomarker data from the trials were mapped to long-term outcomes by an assumed linear relationship between the trial outcome, reduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by > 30%, and the log-hazard ratios for the occurrence of clinical events derived from a large, long-term RCT of cinacalcet (the EVOLVE trial). After submission of a confidential Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount reducing etelcalcetide drug costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet was 14,778 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the company's base case. While this value is lower than the NICE threshold range of 20,000 pound and 30,000 pound per QALY gained, it was the opinion of the ERG that the ICER was highly uncertain due to efficacy data limitations for etelcalcetide, inadequate synthesis of clinical-effectiveness evidence, and strong assumptions connecting short-term biomarker data with long-term clinical outcomes. The ERG produced an alternative base case for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet, with an ICER of 22,400 pound per QALY gained, also subject to uncertainty. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended etelcalcetide as an option for the treatment of SHPT in adults with CKD only if treatment with a calcimimetic is indicated and cinacalcet is not suitable, subject to the company's provision of the agreed PAS discount.","[Rose, Micah; Shepherd, Jonathan; Harris, Petra; Pickett, Karen; Lord, Joanne] Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Shepherd, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England.",jps@southampton.ac.uk,"Lord, Joanne/H-1417-2011","Lord, Joanne/0000-0003-1086-1624; Shepherd, Jonathan/0000-0003-1682-4330; Pickett, Karen/0000-0002-8631-6465",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA Program [16/10/01 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA Program,"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA Program (project number 16/10/01 STA) [see the NIHR Journals Library website for further information-https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/#/].

We analyze the effect of trade decentralization and adverse selection on information diffusion, expected profits, trading costs, and welfare. Information diffusion through prices is not affected by dealers' strategic trading motives, and there is an informational externality that constrains the informativeness of prices. Trade decentralization can both increase or decrease welfare. A dealer's trading cost is driven by both her own and her counterparties' centrality.

The benefits paid to the participants are deterministic. The contributions to the fund are designed by a spread amortization method, which takes into account the size of the unfunded actuarial liability, defined as the difference between the actuarial liability and the fund assets. We address the case where the fund manager wishes to minimize the solvency risk at the final date of the plan when the fund is underfunded, as well as the case where the fund manager wishes to maximize an increasing, constant elasticity utility function of the fund surplus, when the fund is overfunded. The optimal portfolio and contributions are obtained in both scenarios, with the help of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A numerical illustration shows the evolution of the plan for several values of the elasticity parameter of the CEV price processes and the risk aversion of the manager, yielding some tips on the main properties of the optimal portfolio.

We consider per-loss optimal reinsurance for the CPP after first determining optimal reinsurance for the diffusion that approximates this CPP. For both the CPP claim process and its diffusion approximation, the financial market in which the insurer invests follows the Black-Scholes model, namely, a single riskless asset that earns interest at a constant rate and a single risky asset whose price process follows a geometric Brownian motion. Under minimal assumptions about admissible forms of reinsurance, we show that optimal per-loss reinsurance is excess-of-loss. Therefore, our result extends the work of the optimality of excess-of-loss reinsurance to the problem of minimizing the probability of ruin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we consider a problem of optimal choice of a contingent claim so as to minimize a non-linear pricing functional (or a distortion risk measure), subject to a minimum expected performance measure (or a minimum expected return or utility), where expectations with respect to distorted probabilities are taken in the sense of Choquet. Such contingent claims are called cost-efficient. We give an analytical characterization of cost-efficient contingent claims under very mild assumptions on the probability weighting functions, thereby extending some of the results of Ghossoub (Math Financ Econ 10(1): 87111, 2016), and we provide examples of some special cases of interest. In particular, we show how a cost-efficient contingent claim exhibits a desirable monotonicity property: It is anti-comonotonic with the random mark-to-market value (or return, etc.) of the underlying financial position, and it is hence a hedge against such variability.","[Ghossoub, Mario] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Ghossoub, M (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",mario.ehossoub@uwaterloo.ca,,"Ghossoub, Mario/0000-0002-6718-783X",,,,,40,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

NICE commissioned Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC) as an independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) to provide a critique of the manufacturer's submitted evidence. Reslizumab is compared with best standard of care and omalizumab, for a small 'overlap' population of patients who have both eosinophilic and IgE-mediated severe asthma. This paper provides a summary of the ERG's review of the manufacturer's submission, and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (issued in August 2017). The ERG considered that there were limitations in the approach proposed by the manufacturer for the exacerbation rate and the utility for severe exacerbation. The company amended their initial analysis, following comments from the ERG and the NICE committee, whereby the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was A 29,870 pound per QALY gained for reslizumab compared with best standard care. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) concluded that reslizumab was recommended as an option for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma that is inadequately controlled in adults despite maintenance therapy with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another drug, only if (1) the blood eosinophil count has been recorded as 400 cells per microlitre or more and (2) the patient has had three or more asthma exacerbations in the past 12 months, and (3) the company provides reslizumab with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.","[Cooper, Keith; Frampton, Geoff; Harris, Petra; Rose, Micah; Chorozoglou, Maria; Pickett, Karen] Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Fac Med, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Cooper, K (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Fac Med, Alpha House,Enterprise Rd,Southampton Sci Pk, Southampton SO16 7NS, Hants, England.",kc@soton.ac.uk,"Frampton, Geoff/B-5818-2017","Frampton, Geoff/0000-0003-2005-0497; Cooper, Keith/0000-0002-0318-7670; Chorozoglou, Maria/0000-0001-5070-4653; Pickett, Karen/0000-0002-8631-6465",National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme [15/121/14],National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This work was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme as Project number 15/121/14.,,16,12,13,0,2,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2018,36.0,5,,,,,545,553,,10.1007/s40273-017-0608-z,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GD3JD,29582406.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430399300004,0

A set of guards form a dominating set on a graph and at the beginning of each round, a vertex not in the dominating set is attacked. To defend against the attack, the guards move (each guard either passes or moves to a neighboring vertex) to form a dominating set that includes the attacked vertex. The minimum number of guards required to defend against any sequence of attacks is the eternal domination number of the graph. In 2005, it was conjectured [Goddard et al. (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 52:169-180, 2005)] there would be no advantage to allow multiple guards to occupy the same vertex during a round. We show this is, in fact, false.

The aim of this paper was to critically review the Australian MES experience. We performed a comprehensive review of publicly available Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee online documents from January 2010 to July 2017. Relevant information on each MES agreement was systematically extracted, including its rationale, the conditions that guided its implementation and its policy outcomes. We identified 11 drugs where an MES was considered. Most of the identified drugs (75%) were antineoplastic agents and the main uncertainty was the overall survival benefit. More than half of the MES proposals were made by sponsors and most of the schemes were considered after previous rejected/deferred submissions for reimbursement. An MES was not established in 8 of 11 drugs (73%) despite the high evidence uncertainty. Nevertheless, six of these eight drugs were listed after the sponsors reduced their prices. Three MESs were established and implemented by Deeds of Agreement. The three cases were concluded and the required data were submitted within the agreed time frames. The need for feasibility and value of an MES should be carefully considered by stakeholders before embarking on such an agreement. It is essential to engage major stakeholders, including patient representatives, in this process. The conditions governing MESs should be clear, transparent and balanced to address the expectations of various stakeholders.","[Tuffaha, Haitham W.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Tuffaha, Haitham W.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Griffith University,"Tuffaha, HW (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.;Tuffaha, HW (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Sch Med, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",haitham.tuffaha@griffith.edu.au,"Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021; Tuffaha, Haitham W/P-2676-2016","Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Tuffaha, Haitham W/0000-0003-2993-3480",Australian NHMRC fellowship [GNT1121232],Australian NHMRC fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Haitham Tuffaha is supported by an Australian NHMRC fellowship (GNT1121232).

This class exhibits desirable properties relevant to actuarial science and inference. The proposed distribution can be related to some well known distributions like Moyal, folded-normal and chi-square. Statistical inference of the model parameters is discussed using the method of quantiles and the method of maximum likelihood estimation. Three celebrated data sets, namely, Norwegian fire insurance losses, Danish fire insurance losses and vehicle insurance losses, are used to show the applicability of the new class of distributions. Parametric regression modelling is discussed assuming that the response variable follows the generalized log-Moyal distribution.

The embedded longevity put (call) options give the annuity provider (annuitant) the right to periodically adjust the benefit payments downwards (upwards) if the observed survivorship rates are higher (lower) than those predicted at the contract initiation, transferring part of the longevity risk to the annuitant. Alternative decompositions for the payout stream of a capped longevity-linked life annuity are also explored. We incorporate capital market risk and assess how individuals with different risk aversion and subjective time preferences value the stochastic payout stream of both index-linked and participating contract structures. We discuss the valuation of the embedded longevity options using a risk-neutral simulation approach. The paper revisits and expands previous results on the problem of designing and pricing life annuity contracts which aim at sharing longevity and investment risk between annuity provider and annuitants within the context of building the post-retirement income.

Furthermore, since the quadratic specification guarantees the positive definiteness of the covariance matrix without restricting the sign of factors, it allows for a flexible specification of the physical drift as does the Gaussian term structure model, contributing also to accurate level prediction.","[Takamizawa, Hideyuki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Commerce & Management, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Takamizawa, H (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Commerce & Management, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",Hi.Takamizawa@r.hit-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [15K03538]; Tokio Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation Research Grant; JCER Research Grant; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03538] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Tokio Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation Research Grant; JCER Research Grant; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Support from JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 15K03538]; Tokio Marine Kagami Memorial Foundation Research Grant, and JCER Research Grant are gratefully acknowledged.",,24,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In particular, we focus on the U-shaped pricing kernel against the stock index return, which is closely related to the negative call returns. We assume that the stock index return follows a time-changed Levy process and that a representative investor has power utility over the aggregate consumption that forms a linear regression of the stock index return and its stochastic activity rate. This model offers a macroeconomic interpretation of the stylized facts from the perspective of the sensitivity of the activity rate and stock index return on aggregate consumption as well as the investor's risk aversion.","[Yamazaki, Akira] Hosei Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Chiyoda Ku, 2-17-1 Fujimi, Tokyo 1028160, Japan; [Yamazaki, Akira] Hosei Univ, Res Inst Innovat Management, Chiyoda Ku, 2-17-1 Fujimi, Tokyo 1028160, Japan",Hosei University; Hosei University,"Yamazaki, A (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Chiyoda Ku, 2-17-1 Fujimi, Tokyo 1028160, Japan.;Yamazaki, A (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Res Inst Innovat Management, Chiyoda Ku, 2-17-1 Fujimi, Tokyo 1028160, Japan.",akira2yamazaki@hosei.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [26380402]; Research Institute for Innovation Management at Hosei University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26380402, 17K03815] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Research Institute for Innovation Management at Hosei University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author gratefully acknowledges the financial support of JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 26380402].

If all items are goods and utility functions are homogeneous of degree 1 and concave (and monotone), the competitive division maximizes the Nash product of utilities (Gale-Eisenberg): hence it is welfarist (determined by the set of feasible utility profiles), unique, continuous, and easy to compute. We show that the competitive division of a mixed manna is still welfarist. If the zero utility profile is Pareto dominated, the competitive profile is strictly positive and still uniquely maximizes the product of utilities. If the zero profile is unfeasible (for instance, if all items are bads), the competitive profiles are strictly negative and are the critical points of the product of disutilities on the efficiency frontier. The latter allows for multiple competitive utility profiles, from which no single-valued selection can be continuous or resource monotonic. Thus the implementation of competitive fairness under linear preferences in interactive platforms like SPLIDDIT will be more difficult when the manna contains bads that overwhelm the goods.","[Bogomolnaia, Anna; Moulin, Herve] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Bogomolnaia, Anna; Moulin, Herve; Sandomirskiy, Fedor; Yanovskaya, Elena] Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",University of Glasgow; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Bogomolnaia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Bogomolnaia, A (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",Anna.Bogomolnaia@glasgow.ac.uk; herve.moulin@glasgow.ac.uk; fsandomirskiy@hse.ru; eyanovskaya@hse.ru,"Sandomirskiy, Fedor/AAZ-7437-2020; Sandomirskiy, Fedor A/F-1733-2017; Moulin, Herve/F-3475-2015","Sandomirskiy, Fedor/0000-0001-9886-3688; Sandomirskiy, Fedor A/0000-0001-9886-3688;",Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-01-00269],Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics; Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"Support from the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics is gratefully acknowledged.

However, not all willing donors can donate to their intended recipients because of medical incompatibilities. These incompatibilities can be overcome by an exchange of donors between patients. For kidneys, such exchanges have become widespread in the last decade with the introduction of optimization and market design techniques to kidney exchange. A small but growing number of liver exchanges have also been conducted. Over the last two decades, a number of transplantation procedures emerged where organs from two living donors are transplanted to a single patient. Prominent examples include dual-graft liver transplantation, lobar lung transplantation, and simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. Exchange, however, has been neither practiced nor introduced in this context. We introduce dual-donor organ exchange as a novel transplantation modality, and through simulations show that living-donor transplants can be significantly increased through such exchanges. We also provide a simple theoretical model for dual-donor organ exchange and introduce optimal exchange mechanisms under various logistical constraints.","[Ergin, Haluk] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sonmez, Tayfun; Unver, M.

I present a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator for , which does not require prescribing a functional form for phi, let alone a parametrization. Furthermore, the rate of convergence in probability is equal to at least n-2/7, and approaches n-1/2 if a certain density is sufficiently differentiable around the origin. This method allows both heteroscedasticity and skewness of the distribution of e|X,V. Moreover, under suitable conditions, the proposed estimator exhibits an oracle property, namely the rate of convergence is identical to that when phi is known. A Monte Carlo study is conducted, and reveals the benefits of this estimator with fat-tailed and/or skewed data.

These health policy models represent the social and biological mechanisms that determine health and economic outcomes, combine multiple sources of evidence about how policy alternatives will impact those outcomes, and synthesize outcomes into summary measures salient for the policy decision. Calibrating these health policy models to fit empirical data can provide face validity and improve the quality of model predictions. Bayesian methods provide powerful tools for model calibration. These methods summarize information relevant to a particular policy decision into (1) prior distributions for model parameters, (2) structural assumptions of the model, and (3) a likelihood function created from the calibration data, combining these different sources of evidence via Bayes' theorem. This article provides a tutorial on Bayesian approaches for model calibration, describing the theoretical basis for Bayesian calibration approaches as well as pragmatic considerations that arise in the tasks of creating calibration targets, estimating the posterior distribution, and obtaining results to inform the policy decision. These considerations, as well as the specific steps for implementing the calibration, are described in the context of an extended worked example about the policy choice to provide (or not provide) treatment for a hypothetical infectious disease.

In this paper, we provide a natural definition of structural causality in cross-section and panel data and forge a direct link between Granger (G-) causality and structural causality under a key conditional exogeneity assumption. To put it simply, when structural effects are well defined and identifiable, G-non-causality follows from structural noncausality, and with suitable conditions (e.g., separability or monotonicity), structural causality also implies G-causality. This justifies using tests of G-non-causality to test for structural noncausality under the key conditional exogeneity assumption for both cross-section and panel data. We pay special attention to heterogeneous populations, allowing both structural heterogeneity and distributional heterogeneity. Most of our results are obtained for the general case, without assuming linearity, monotonicity in observables or unobservables, or separability between observed and unobserved variables in the structural relations.","[Lu, Xun] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [White, Halbert] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Singapore Management University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Lu, X (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xunlu@ust.hk,"SU, Liangjun/D-1445-2009","Su, Liangjun/0000-0002-0565-6928",Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund [MOE2012-T2-2-021],"Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","This paper is dedicated to the memory of Hal White, who is profoundly missed.

With this in mind, we consider multi-period MV optimal portfolio allocation in the presence of periodic withdrawals. The investment portfolio can be allocated between a risk-free investment and a risky asset, the price of which is assumed to follow a jump diffusion process. We consider two wealth management applications: optimal de-accumulation rates for a defined contribution pension plan and sustainable withdrawal rates for an endowment. Several numerical illustrations are provided, with some interesting implications. In the pension de-accumulation context, Bengen (1994)'s [J. Financial Planning, 1994, 7, 171-180], historical analysis indicated that a retiree could safely withdraw 4% of her initial retirement savings annually (in real terms), provided that her portfolio maintained an even balance between diversified equities and U.S. Treasury bonds. Our analysis does support 4% as a sustainable withdrawal rate in the pension de-accumulation context (and a somewhat lower rate for an endowment), but only if the investor follows an MV optimal portfolio allocation, not a fixed proportion strategy. Compared with a constant proportion strategy, the MV optimal policy achieves the same expected wealth at the end of the investment horizon, while significantly reducing the standard deviation of wealth and the probability of shortfall. We also explore the effects of suppressing jumps so as to have a pure diffusion process, but assuming a correspondingly larger volatility for the latter process. Surprisingly, it turns out that the MV optimal strategy is more effective when there are large downward jumps compared to having a high volatility diffusion process. Finally, tests based on historical data demonstrate that the MV optimal policy is quite robust to uncertainty about parameter estimates.","[Duy-Minh Dang] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Forsyth, P.

Our results imply that an additional premium should be added when evaluating debt in order to account for rollover risks, especially for short-matured bonds.

This diagnostic test extends the time-domain gof statistic of Maravall(2003) by taking into account the effects of model parameter uncertainty, utilizing theoretical results of McElroy and Holan(2009). We demonstrate that omitting this correction results in a severely undersized statistic. Adequate size and power are obtained in Monte Carlo studies for fairly short time series (10 to 15 years of monthly data). Our Monte Carlo studies of finite sample size and power consider different combinations of both signal and noise components using seasonal, trend, and irregular component models obtained via canonical decomposition. Details of the implementation appropriate for SARIMA models are given. We apply the gof diagnostic test statistics to several U.S. Census Bureau time series. The results generally corroborate the output of the automatic model selection procedure of the X-12-ARIMA software, which in contrast to our diagnostic test statistic does not involve hypothesis testing. We conclude that these diagnostic test statistics are a useful supplementary model-checking tool for practitioners engaged in the task of model-based seasonal adjustment.","[Blakely, Chris; McElroy, Tucker] US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Blakely, C (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",cblakely@econometricainc.com,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We first show how to adjust greeks to take correlation into account and reduce P&L volatility. Then we embed correlation-adjusted greeks in a global hedging strategy that reduces cost of hedging without increasing P&L volatility, by optimization of hedge re-adjustments. The strategy is justified in terms of a balance between transaction costs and risk-aversion, but, unlike more complex proposals from previous literature, it is completely defined by observable parameters, geometrically intuitive, and easy to implement for an arbitrary number of risk factors. We test our findings on a CVA hedging example. We first consider daily re-hedging: in this test, correlation-adjusted greeks allow the reduction of P&L volatility by more than 30% compared to standard deltas. Then we apply our general strategy to a context where a CVA portfolio is exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. The strategy keeps P&L volatility in line with daily standard delta-hedging, but with massive cost-saving: only six rebalances of the illiquid credit hedge are performed, over a period of six months.","[Daluiso, Roberto; Morini, Massimo] Banca IMI, Interest Rate & Credit Models, Largo Mattioli 3, Milan, Italy",,"Morini, M (通讯作者)，Banca IMI, Interest Rate & Credit Models, Largo Mattioli 3, Milan, Italy.",massimo.morini@bancaimi.com,"Meneghetti, Massimo/AAB-4321-2020","DALUISO, ROBERTO/0000-0001-5943-5808",,,,,11,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The information criteria proposed by Bai and Ng (2002) require the cross-sectional correlations between the error terms to be weak. Violation of this weak correlation assumption may lead to inconsistent estimates of the number of factors. We establish two data-dependent estimators that are consistent whether the error terms are weakly or strongly correlated in the cross-sectional dimension. To handle potentially strong cross-sectional correlations between the error terms, we use a block structure in which the within-block correlation may either be weak or strong, but the between-block correlation is limited. Our estimators allow imperfect knowledge and a moderate misspecification of the block structure. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that our estimators perform similarly to existing methods for cases in which the conventional weak correlation assumption is satisfied.

This paper investigates whether the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can improve option pricing and implied volatility forecasting. This is done with special attention to foreign exchange and index options. To this end, we carried out an empirical analysis on the prices of call and put options on the US S&P 500 index and Eurodollar futures using a generalization of the Heston model in the stochastic interest rate framework. Specifically, the dynamics of the option's underlying asset is described by two factors: a stochastic variance and a stochastic interest rate. The volatility is not allowed to be negative, but the interest rate is. Explicit formulas for the transition probability density function and moments are derived. These formulas are used to estimate the model parameters efficiently. Three empirical analyses are illustrated. The first two show that the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can efficiently reproduce implied volatility and forecast option prices (i.e. S&P index and foreign exchange options). The last studies how the US three-month government bond yield affects the US S&P 500 index.","[Recchioni, Maria Cristina] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Management, Ancona, Italy; [Sun, Yu] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Ancona, Italy; [Tedeschi, Gabriele] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University; Universitat Jaume I,"Tedeschi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",gtedesch@uji.es,"Tedeschi, Gabriele/JNE-2457-2023; Recchioni, Maria Cristina/A-6121-2016","Tedeschi, Gabriele/0000-0003-2638-7373; Recchioni, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9049-6964",National Social Science Foundation of China [15BGL158],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the National Social Science Foundation of China, on the project of Evaluation and Research on the Policy Effectiveness of National 'Famous Medical Studio' Based on the Inter-generational Transfer of Knowledge [grant agreement number 15BGL158].",,37,8,8,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We construct extreme risk spillover networks at 1% and 5% risk levels (which we denote 1% and 5% VaR networks) based on the daily returns of 84 publicly listed financial institutions from four sectorsbanks, diversified financials, insurance and real estateduring the period 2006-2015. We find that extreme risk spillover networks have a time-lag effect. Both the static and dynamic networks show that on average the real estate and bank sectors are net senders of extreme risk spillovers and the insurance and diversified financials sectors are net recipients, which coheres with the evidence from the recent global financial crisis. The networks during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis exhibited distinctive topological features that differed from those in tranquil periods. Our approach supplies new information on the interconnectedness across financial agents that will prove valuable not only to investors and hedge fund managers, but also to regulators and policy-makers.","[Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Xie, Chi] Hunan Univ, Ctr Finance & Investment Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang-Jin; Stanley, H.

Literature reviews of the modeling methods and results from these CEAs have also been published. The last literature review that focused on modeling methods, without country or time horizon in the inclusion criteria, included studies published up to 2012. Since then, new DMTs have become available, and new models and data sources have been used to assess their cost effectiveness.ObjectiveThe aim of this systematic review was to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the relevant aspects of economic models used in CEAs of DMTs for RRMS, to understand how these models have progressed from recommendations provided in past reviews, what new approaches have been developed, what issues remain, and how they could be addressed.MethodsEMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the National Health System (NHS) Economic Evaluations Database, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, and EconLit were searched for cost-effectiveness studies of DMTs for RRMS that used decision-analytic models, published in English between 1 January 2012 and 24 December 2017. The inclusion criteria were as follows: being a full economic evaluation, a decision-analytic model was used, the target population concerned adult patients with RRMS, and being available in full-text format. Studies were not excluded based on the methodological quality. The background information of the included studies, as well as specific information on the components of the economic models related to the areas of recommendation from previous reviews were extracted.ResultsTwenty-three studies from ten countries were included. The model structure of these studies has converged over time, characterizing the course of disease progression in terms of changes in disability and the occurrence of relapses over time. Variations were found in model approach; data sources for the natural course of the disease and comparative efficacy between DMTs; number of lines of treatment modeled; long-term efficacy waning and treatment discontinuation assumptions; type of withdrawal; and criteria for selecting adverse events. Main areas for improvement include using long-term time horizons and societal perspective; reporting relevant health outcomes; conducting scenario analyses using different sources of natural history and utility values; and reporting how the model was validated.ConclusionThe structure of economic models used in CEAs of DMTs for RRMS has converged over time. However, variation remains in terms of model approach, inputs, and assumptions. Though some recommendations from previous reviews have been incorporated in later models, areas for improvement remain.","[Hernandez, Luis; O'Donnell, Malinda] Evidera, 500 Totten Pond Rd,Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Hernandez, Luis; Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, UMCG, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, GRIP, Unit Pharmacotherapy Epidemiol & Econ, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, Groningen, Netherlands",Evidera; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Hernandez, L (通讯作者)，Evidera, 500 Totten Pond Rd,Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.;Hernandez, L (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, UMCG, Dept Hlth Sci, Groningen, Netherlands.",luis.hernandez@evidera.com,"Hernandez, Luis/AAH-1819-2021","Hernandez, Luis/0000-0002-9532-546X; Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",,,,,118,13,13,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1223,1252,,10.1007/s40273-018-0683-9,0.0,,,30,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29971666.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800006,0

Pharmaceutical manufacturers recently released transparency reports disclosing net price increases after accounting for rebates and other discounts. Objective Our objective was to determine whether manufacturer net prices (MNPs) could approximate the discounted prices observed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Methods We compared the annual, average price discounts voluntarily reported by three pharmaceutical manufacturers with the VA price for specific products from each company. The top 10 drugs by total sales reported from company tax filings for 2016 were included. The discount observed by the VA was determined from each drug's list price, reported as WAC, in 2016. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the VA discount observed and a weighted price index was calculated using the lowest price to the VA (Weighted VA Index), which was compared with the manufacturer index. Results The discounted price as a percentage of the WAC ranged from 9 to 74%. All three indexes estimated by the average discount to the VA were at or below the manufacturer indexes (42 vs. 50% for Eli Lilly, 56 vs. 65% for Johnson & Johnson, and 59 vs. 59% for Merck). Conclusions Manufacturer-reported average net prices may provide a close approximation of the average discounted price granted to the VA, suggesting they may be a useful proxy for the true pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) or payer cost. However, individual discounts for products have wide variation, making a standard discount adjustment across multiple products less acceptable.","[Mattingly, T.

Two results that contrast with the previous literature are that (a) the relationship between market liquidity and economic efficiency is independent of the activist's initial stake for a broad set of activism technologies, and (b) an increase in noise trading can reduce market liquidity because it increases uncertainty about the activist's trades (the activist trades in the opposite direction of noise traders) and thereby increases information asymmetry about the activist's intentions.","[Back, Kerry] Rice Univ, Jones Grad Sch Business, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Back, Kerry] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Fos, Vyacheslav] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Li, Tao] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ljungqvist, Alexander] Swedish House Finance, Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ljungqvist, Alexander] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Rice University; Rice University; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Boston College; City University of Hong Kong; Stockholm School of Economics; Swedish House of Finance; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Back, K (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Jones Grad Sch Business, Houston, TX 77251 USA.;Back, K (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",Kerry.E.Back@rice.edu; pierre.collin-dufresne@epfl.ch; fos@bc.edu; taoli3@cityu.edu.hk; alexander.ljungqvist@hhs.se,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Ljungqvist, Alexander/F-5568-2011; Li, Tao/L-7424-2013","Ljungqvist, Alexander/0000-0002-6823-7771; Li, Tao/0000-0002-9859-2491",Swedish House of Finance,Swedish House of Finance,"This paper consolidates and substantially extends the theory parts of two prior working papers: Back, Li, and Ljungqvist (2015) and Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2015b).

The precise mathematical formulation of SR is still scrutinised, but the main purpose is to evaluate the financial distress of a system as a result of the failure of one component of the financial system in question. Many of the mathematical definitions of SR are based on evaluating expectations in extreme regions and therefore, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) represents the key ingredient in producing valuable estimates of SR and even its decomposition per individual components of the entire system. Without doubt, the prescribed dependence model amongst the system components has a major impact over our asymptotic approximations. Thus, this paper considers various well-known dependence models in the EVT literature that allow us to generate SR estimates. Our findings reveal that SR has a significant impact under asymptotic dependence, while weak tail dependence, known as asymptotic independence, produces an insignificant loss over the regulatory capital.","[Asimit, Alexandru V.] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Li, Jinzhu] Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinzhu] Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",City University London; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Li, JZ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.;Li, JZ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, LPMC, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",asimit@city.ac.uk; lijinzhu@nankai.edu.cn,"Asimit, Vali/ABC-9324-2022; Li, Jinzhu/F-8687-2010","Asimit, Vali/0000-0002-7706-0066;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11371020],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors are very grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their thorough reading of the paper and constructive suggestions.

But there are also other variations to the game, involving for example real number weights on the moves of the disks. This gives rise to a similar type of problem, but where the final score seeks to be optimized.

We model the underlying mutual fund dynamics by combining a Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model together with a Hull and White (1990) stochastic interest rate process. The model is able to capture the smile/skew often observed on equity option markets (Grzelak and Oosterlee 2011) as well as the influence of the interest rates on the early surrender decisions as noted from our analysis. The annuity provider charges management fees which are proportional to the level of the mutual fund as a way of funding the VA contract. To determine the optimal surrender decisions, we present the problem as a 4-dimensional free-boundary partial differential equation (PDE) which is then solved efficiently by the method of lines (MOL) approach. The MOL algorithm facilitates simultaneous computation of the prices, fair management fees, optimal surrender boundaries and hedge ratios of the variable annuity contract as part of the solution at no additional computational cost. A comprehensive analysis on the impact of various risk factors in influencing the policyholder's surrender behaviour is carried out, highlighting the significance of both stochastic volatility and interest rate parameters in influencing the policyholder's surrender behaviour. With the aid of the hedge ratios obtained from the MOL, we construct an effective dynamic hedging strategy to mitigate the provider's risk and compare different hedging performances when the policyholders' surrender behaviour is either optimal or sub-optimal.

By examining some related potential measures, we first derive an explicit expression for the expected terminal utility of the entity in the DBRS model with Brownian motion dynamics. The analysis is later generalized to time-homogeneous Markov framework, where the spectrally negative Levy model is also discussed as a special example. Our results show that, even considering the impact of the termination risk, the DBRS strategy can still outperform its counterparts in either single regime strategy. This study shows that the DBRS model is not myopic, as it not only helps to recover from significant losses, but also may improve the insurer's overall welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the pricing distortions and provide monotone comparative statics. Under (nested) CES and logit demands, another aggregation property obtains: All relevant information for determining a firm's performance and competitive impact is contained in that firm's uni-dimensional type.

From a numerical point of view, pricing such options corresponds to moderate and high-dimensional numerical integration problems with non-smooth integrands. Due to this lack of regularity, higher order numerical integration techniques may not be directly available, requiring the use of methods like Monte Carlo specifically designed to work for non-regular problems. We propose to use the inherent smoothing property of the density of the underlying in the above models to mollify the payoff function by means of an exact conditional expectation. The resulting conditional expectation is unbiased and yields a smooth integrand, which is amenable to the efficient use of adaptive sparse-grid cubature.

Here, the large number of risk factors rules out traditional PDE-based techniques and allows only a relatively small number of paths for nested Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in large variances of estimators in practice. We propose a novel approach based on Kolmogorov forward and backward PDEs, where we counter the high dimensionality by a generalization of anchored-ANOVA decompositions. By computing only the most significant terms in the decomposition, the dimensionality is reduced effectively, such that a significant computational speed-up arises from the high accuracy of PDE schemes in low dimensions compared to Monte Carlo estimation. Moreover, we show how this truncated decomposition can be used as control variate for the full high-dimensional model, such that any approximation errors can be corrected while a substantial variance reduction is achieved compared to the standard simulation approach. We investigate the accuracy for a realistic portfolio of exchange options, interest rate and cross-currency swaps under a fully calibrated 10-factor model.","[de Graaf, C. S.

The analysis is conducted under a risk-averse framework rather than the standard Markowitz formulation in the case of i.i.d. asset processes. We make this practical achievement by considering a threshold stopping rule as the strategy to determine when to exit the market. The resulting investment horizon is random and can be correlated with the market. Under this setting, we first provide an analytical approximation to optimal weights, and then identify a class of reference variables associated with the stopping rule that leads to ex-ante improvements in portfolio allocation, vis-a-vis the fixed exit time alternative. The latter conclusion is based on a generalization of the Sharpe ratio, adjusted for horizon uncertainty. The obtained investment suggestion is simple and can be implemented empirically.","[Fuh, C.

The goal of this paper is to provide a unified view on both approaches. This is achieved by studying reduced-form approaches under weak assumptions. In particular, we do not assume the global existence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable times, such as coupon payment dates, with positive probability. In this generalized framework, we study dynamic term structures prone to default risk following the forward-rate approach proposed by Heath, Jarrow, and Morton. It turns out that previously considered models lead to arbitrage possibilities when default can happen at a predictable time. A suitable generalization of the forward-rate approach contains an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable times and necessary and sufficient conditions for an appropriate no-arbitrage condition are given. For efficient implementations, we develop a new class of affine models that do not satisfy the standard assumption of stochastic continuity. The chosen approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of filtrations, for which we provide an example by means of filtering theory where the Azema supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps, both at predictable and totally inaccessible stopping times.","[Gehmlich, Frank; Schmidt, Thorsten] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Schmidt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Math Insitute, Eckerstr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",thorsten.schmidt@stochastik.uni-freiburg.de,,"Schmidt, Thorsten/0000-0001-9254-4010",Chair Risque de Credit,Chair Risque de Credit,"We thank Monique Jeanblanc, Shiqi Song, Ania Aksamit, Claudio Fontana, Rudiger Frey, and two anonymous referees for very valuable discussions.

The GME formulations, combining information from the sample together with out-of-sample aggregates of the population of interest, can be particularly useful in the context of small area estimation, for both direct and model-based estimators, since they do not require strong distributional assumptions on the disturbances.

Many international agencies generate their own guidelines providing details on their preferred methods for HTA submissions, and there is variability in both what they recommend and the clarity and amount of detail provided in their guidelines. This article provides an overview of international regulations and recommendations for utility data in HTA for a selection of key HTA countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain (Catalonia), Sweden and the UK (England/Wales and Scotland). International guidelines are typically clear and detailed for the selection of countries assessed regarding the source description of health states (e.g. generic preference-based measure) and who should provide preference weights for these health states (e.g. general population for own country). Many guidelines specify the use of off-the-shelf generic preference-based measures, and some further specify a measure, such as EQ-5D. However, international guidelines are either unclear or lack detailed guidance regarding the collection (e.g. patients report own health), source (e.g. clinical trial) and usage (e.g. adjusting for comorbidities) of utility values. It is argued that there is a need for transparent and detailed international guidelines on utility data recommendations to provide decision makers with the best possible evidence. Where this is not possible it is recommended that best practice should be used to inform the collection, source and usage of utility values in HTA.","[Rowen, Donna; van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Zouraq, Ismail Azzabi; Chevrou-Severac, Helene] Takeda Pharmaceut Int AG, Thurgauerstr 130, CH-8152 Glattpark Opfikon, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Sheffield; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk; Ismail.Azzabi-Zouraq@takeda.com,,,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,27,97,97,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S11,S19,,10.1007/s40273-017-0544-y,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052162.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400004,0

However, the use of expensive targeted therapies can impact on the cost effectiveness of these tests. This study presents an economic evaluation of genomic testing in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the context of the UK National Health Service. Methods Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses (using life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) were undertaken from a National Health Service and societal perspective. Five strategies were evaluated across several age groups using Markov modelling: three strategies that reflected varying current genetic testing practice and two configurations of genomic testing (including ibrutinib treatment). Results Genomic testing strategies yielded the most life-years/quality-adjusted life-years per patient, but were not cost effective compared with a threshold of A 30,000 pound per life-year/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that there was some uncertainty surrounding this result. A genomic testing strategy becomes the most cost-effective option if a higher end-of-life cost-effectiveness threshold of A 50,000 pound is applied, if a societal costing perspective is considered in 25-year-old patients or if the cost of ibrutinib treatment falls. Conclusion Stratifying patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to targeted treatment using genomic testing improves health outcomes, but will likely only represent a cost-effective use of limited National Health Service resources if a higher cost-effectiveness threshold or societal costing perspective is applied, or if the price of ibrutinib treatment is reduced. This result may be broadly indicative of the likely cost effectiveness of other genomic tests that inform the stratification of patients to high cost-targeted therapies.","[Buchanan, James; Wordsworth, Sarah] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Clifford, Ruth; Robbe, Pauline; Schuh, Anna] Oxford Univ Hosp Trust, Oxford Mol Diagnost Ctr, Oxford, England; [Clifford, Ruth; Schuh, Anna] Churchill Hosp, Oxford Canc & Haematol Ctr, Oxford, England; [Taylor, Jenny C.; Schuh, Anna; Knight, Samantha J.

The appraisal assessed evolocumab as monotherapy or in combination with a statin with or without ezetimibe, or in combination with ezetimibe (without statin therapy), in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (which includes mixed dyslipidaemia), for whom statins do not provide optimal control of their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and/or for whom statins are contraindicated or not tolerated. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based on the company's submission to NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from four randomised controlled trials comparing evolocumab with either ezetimibe or placebo in adults with primary familial or non-familial hypercholesterolaemia, who were either able to take statins or who were statin intolerant. The clinical-effectiveness review found that evolocumab is efficacious at lowering LDL-C but that there was uncertainty regarding its impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In response to the ERG's critique of the submitted health economic model, the company submitted an amended model, which also included a patient access scheme (PAS). Based on this, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for evolocumab against ezetimibe were above A 74,000 pound and A 45,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained within the non-familial primary and secondary prevention populations, respectively, whilst the ICER within the heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) population was approximately A 23,000 pound per QALY gained. The final determination was that evolocumab would be a clinically and cost-effective use of UK NHS resource in certain patient subgroups.","[Carroll, Christopher; Tappenden, Paul; Rafia, Rachid; Hamilton, Jean; Chambers, Duncan; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Durrington, Paul] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9NT, Lancs, England; [Qureshi, Nadeem] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Wierzbicki, Anthony S.] Guys & St Thomas Hosp, London SE1 7EH, England",University of Sheffield; University of Manchester; University of Nottingham; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,"Carroll, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",c.carroll@shef.ac.uk,"Wierzbicki, Anthony/AAP-1735-2020; Carroll, Chris/HHC-1512-2022","Wierzbicki, Anthony/0000-0003-2756-372X; Qureshi, Nadeem/0000-0003-4909-0644; Chambers, Duncan/0000-0002-0154-0469; Hamilton, Jean/0000-0003-3326-9842",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [14/177/05],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project No. 14/177/05).

However, this estimation procedure depends on a regularization or tuning parameter a that needs to be selected. The aim of the present paper is to provide a way to optimally choose a by minimizing the approximate mean square error (AMSE) of the estimator. Following an approach similar to that of Donald and Newey (2001), we derive a higher-order expansion of the estimator from which we characterize the finite sample dependence of the AMSE on a. We propose to select the regularization parameter by minimizing an estimate of the AMSE. We show that this procedure delivers a consistent estimator of a. Moreover, the data-driven selection of the regularization parameter preserves the consistency, asymptotic normality, and efficiency of the CGMM estimator. Simulation experiments based on a CIR model show the relevance of the proposed approach.","[Carrasco, Marine] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Kotchoni, Rachidi] African Sch Econ, Abomey Calavi, Atlantique Depa, Benin",Universite de Montreal; African School of Economics; University of Abomey Calavi,"Kotchoni, R (通讯作者)，African Sch Econ, Abomey Calavi, Atlantique Depa, Benin.",rachidi.kotchoni@africanschoolofeconomics.com,"Carrasco, Marine/ACU-3814-2022",,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This paper has been presented at various conferences and seminars and we thank the participants for their comments, especially discussant Atsushi Inoue.

The mean structure does not refer merely to the level of the curves, but also to their range and other aspects of their shape, most prominently concavity. The performance of the tests depends on whether possible break points in the error structure, which refers to the random variability in the aspects of the curves listed above, are taken into account or not. If they are not taken into account, then an existing change point in the mean structure may fail to be detected with a large probability. The paper contains a complete asymptotic theory, a simulation study and illustrative data examples, as well as details of the numerical implementation of the testing procedures.","[Bardsley, Patrick] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Horvath, Lajos] Univ Utah, Dept Math, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Kokoszka, Piotr] Colorado State Univ, Dept Stat, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Young, Gabriel] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Colorado State University; Columbia University,"Bardsley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bardsley@ices.utexas.edu; horvath@math.utah.edu; Piotr.Kokoszka@colostate.edu; gjy2107@columbia.edu,"Horvath, Lajos/R-7559-2019","Horvath, Lajos/0000-0001-8594-4972","NSF [DMS-1462067, DMS-1305858]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1462067] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1305858] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank the editor, Professor Dennis Kristensen, and three referees for reading our work carefully and for providing detailed advice.

For each of the stocks that we study, we identify a sequence of distinct phases across which the net flow of orders differs considerably. We note that some of our results are consistent with the widely reported phenomenon of stimulated refill, but that others are not. We therefore propose alternative mechanical and strategic motivations for the behaviour that we observe. Based on our findings, we argue that strategic liquidity providers consider both adverse selection and expected waiting costs when deciding how to act.","[Bonart, Julius; Gould, Martin D.] Imperial Coll, Dept Math, CFM Imperial Inst Quantitat Finance, London, England; [Bonart, Julius] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England",Imperial College London; University of London; University College London,"Bonart, J (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, Dept Math, CFM Imperial Inst Quantitat Finance, London, England.;Bonart, J (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England.",j.bonart@ucl.ac.uk,,,CFM; James S.

To do so, we describe the information process with regime switching in a product space associated with the product of two filtrations. Moreover, we show how to establish the corresponding multi-stage portfolio selection models using the time consistent multi-period risk measure for medium-term or long-term investments. Take the conditional value-at-risk measure as an example, we demonstrate the resulting multi-stage portfolio selection problem can be transformed into a second-order cone programming problem. Finally, we carry out a series of empirical tests to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed random framework and the corresponding multi-stage portfolio selection model.","[Chen, Zhiping; Liu, Jia; Hui, Yongchang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Dept Comp Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Chen, ZP (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Dept Comp Sci, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zchen@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,"chen, zhiping/IST-6333-2023; Liu, Jia/O-2311-2018","liu, jia/0000-0002-8166-6933","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371152, 11401461, 11571270]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015gjhz15]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71371152], [grant number 11401461], [grant number 11571270].

Bank quotes are found to be poor indicators of their financing costs in the crisis period. The aberration in the estimated values of the cointegrating and error correction parameters governing the long-run equilibrium relationship between bank quotes and the final Libor suggests banks were submitting lower quotes. Further analysis which controls for an individual bank's credit risk, market wide credit and liquidity risks, and a common market factor, demonstrate possible evidence of Libor rigging during the crisis period.","[Chua, Chew Lian; Suardi, Sandy] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Chang, Yuanchen] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",University of Wollongong; National Chengchi University,"Chang, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",yccchang@nccu.edu.tw,"suardi, sandy/JXY-3445-2024","suardi, sandy/0000-0002-0491-8957; Chua, Chew/0000-0003-3201-9497",,,,,53,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.
