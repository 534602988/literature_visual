We evaluate a scholarship programme that alleviated non-tuition costs for girls in a subset of Gambian secondary schools. The programme is unique because it overlapped with a government policy that had already eliminated school fees for girls, allowing for a comparison between programme recipients and students who paid no tuition but were responsible for other expenses. We identify the effect of the programme by comparing outcomes for treated and untreated cohorts within programme schools. We find that non-tuition cost alleviation increased female enrolment by 13% and the share of enrolled students who took the ninth grade exit exam by 11 percentage points. These results highlight the importance of non-tuition costs in secondary school outcomes, even in settings where formal fees have been lifted.","[Giordono, Leanne; Pugatch, Todd] Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Pugatch, Todd] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",Oregon State University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Pugatch, T (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.;Pugatch, T (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.",todd.pugatch@oregonstate.edu,"Pugatch, Todd/Q-3757-2019","Pugatch, Todd/0000-0003-0127-2289; Giordono, Leanne/0000-0002-7412-3340",National Science Foundation [1314109-DGE]; Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1314109] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"We thank officials from the Forum for African Women Educationalists in the Gambia (FAWEGAM), the Gambian Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education, the Banjul office of the West African Examinations Council, the World Bank and World Education (especially Akosua Ampofo, Alpha Bah, Nathalie Lahire, Palamin Mbowe, Yadi Njie-Eribo, Ryoko Tomita Wilcox and Sherif Yunus Hydara) for sharing their data and institutional knowledge with us.

However, previous literature remains ambiguous about the direction of the relationship. This paper provides an empirical evidence of the impact of market structure on investment in the European mobile industry. The empirical assessment is based on a Salop model with vertical differentiation. Consistently with the prediction of this model, we find that both the number of operators and market share asymmetry have significant effects on investment. In symmetric markets, investment per operator falls with the number of operators, with larger effects for operators that lose market share more than the average. The industry investment rises with the number of operators in the short run, but eventually falls in the long run due to significant adjustment costs of investment in the mobile industry. These findings suggest that investment should be taken into account when analysing the welfare effects of market structure in the mobile industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a novel linkage between these two sufficient conditions for the existence of a stable matching in many-to-one matching markets with contracts. A substitutable completion of a preference is a substitutable preference created by adding some sets of contracts to the original preference order. We provide an algorithm which when operated on the unilaterally substitutable preferences produces such a substitutable completion. Thus it provides a constructive proof of the connection between the two properties. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Agents have complete, transitive and strict preferences over bundles of objects. A rule assigns objects to agents. A single object may be assigned to several agents as long as the agents satisfy a compatibility constraint. If no restrictions are imposed on the compatibility structure, there exists no rule that satisfies Pareto efficiency and compatibility-monotonicity. Imposing two restrictions on the compatibility structure, the class of rules called compatibility-sorting sequential dictatorships can be fully characterized by four different combinations of group-strategyproofness, strategyproofness, Pareto efficiency, non-bossiness, compatibility-monotonicity and compatibility-invariance. It is demonstrated that the characterization in Papai (J Public Econ Theory 3:258-271, 2001) of sequential dictatorships for the case where assignments are not allowed to overlap is contained as a special case of the main result. Finally, some additional properties are considered and an extension of the model introducing capacity constraints is presented.","[Kratz, Jorgen] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22207 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Kratz, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22207 Lund, Sweden.",jorgen.kratz@nek.lu.se,,"Kratz, Jorgen/0000-0002-8355-058X",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2012-0107:1],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"I am grateful to two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

Evidence from TAA-linked US microdata,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Outsourcing; Manufacturing; Employment; Trade; Productivity; Firm performance,UNITED-STATES; TRADE; EMPLOYMENT; WAGES; LABOR; INTEGRATION; INPUTS; IMPACT,"We construct a new linked data set with over one thousand offshoring events by matching Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program petition data to U.S. Census Bureau microdata. We exploit these data to study the short- and long-term effects of offshoring on domestic firm-level employment, output, wages, and productivity in this large sample of offshoring events. As implied by heterogeneous firm models with high fixed costs of offshoring, we find that the average offshoring firm in the TAA sample is larger, more productive, older, and more likely to be an exporter, than the average non-offshorer. After initiating offshoring, TAA-certified offshorers experience large declines in employment (0.38 log points), output (0.33log points) and capital (0.25log points), and a concomitant increase in capital and skill intensity, relative to their industry peers. We find no significant change in average wages or productivity measures. Even six years after the initial offshoring event, we find no recovery in employment, output, or capital, and a higher probability of exit. We find similar results (including decline in output, and unchanged wages and productivity) for the aggregate of non-TAA certified plants of multi-plant offshoring firms. We find that the substitution of domestic activity by offshoring is stronger for relatively lower wage, lower capital intensity, lower productivity offshorers. Our results are consistent across two separate difference-in-differences (DID) approaches, and a number of robustness checks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To determine the empirical validity of our model, we examine (the Taylor-rule-type) monetary policy rules and the slope coefficient in the regression of future exchange rate returns on interest rate differentials before and after the recent global financial crisis. We find that economies that reduced the reaction of the policy interest rate to inflation in response to the crisis have positive slope coefficients in the UIP regressions after the crisis, which is consistent with our model. However, economies for which we cannot find clear break evidence for the reaction to inflation in the monetary policy rule do not show a clear directional change in the slope coefficient of the UIP regression.

We further demonstrate that free trade can reduce world total output and total consumer surplus as well as world welfare. Along the way, we correct several oversights in the literature.","[Troge, Michael] ESCP Europe, 97 Ave Republ, F-75543 Paris, France; [Amir, Rabah] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Jin, Jim Y.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; University of Iowa; University of St Andrews,"Tröge, M (通讯作者)，ESCP Europe, 97 Ave Republ, F-75543 Paris, France.",troege@escpeurope.eu,,,,,,,14,4,4,3,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The empirical results indicate convergence in energy intensity, and our estimates accurately predict both the growth in and convergence of energy intensity across our entire sample.

Incorporating export trade, screening-matching and gender discrimination in employment into a unified analysis and applying propensity score matching estimation on the basis of the theoretical framework of micro-enterprise and the optimized behavior of job seekers, this paper examines the relations between export trade of industrial enterprises and female labor employment levels in China during 2005-2007. The results indicate that: (1) the number and ration of female employees are increasing with the size and growth of the enterprise export, regardless of enterprise exports continuity. It demonstrates that export expansion does play a critical role in mitigating gender discrimination in employment. (2) For the enterprise with higher export continuity, there is a significant effect toward improving the number and proportion of female employees, conversely the worse effect. Thus, it is significantly meaningful to mitigate gender discrimination in employment by ensuring the continued export capacity of enterprises. (3) Comparing to the promoting effect of growth in the number of female employees, export has limit effect up on increasing the proportion of female employees. Therefore, it is rather difficult to resolve the issue of gender discrimination in employment by relying completely on exports expansion. Based on research findings, this paper discusses the policy implications in terms of easing gender discrimination in employment and promoting employment equity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the issue of designing a debt consolidation plan which is achieved through a reduction in public consumption and yet is equitable because temporary targeted transfers and tax reductions stabilize consumption of the poorer part of the population.

The Choice of an Inflation Objective when Openness Matters,OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,CPI; Domestic; REX inflation targeting; Openness; Inflation-output trade-off,OPTIMAL MONETARY-POLICY; PRICES; BEHAVIOR,"Inflation targeting countries generally define the inflation objective in terms of the consumer price index. Studies in the academic literature, however, reach conflicting conclusions concerning which measure of inflation a central bank should target in a small open economy. This paper examines the properties of domestic, CPI, and real-exchange-rate-adjusted (REX) inflation targeting. In one class of open economy New Keynesian models there is an isomorphism between optimal policy in an open versus closed economy. In the type of model we consider, where the real exchange rate appears in the Phillips curve, this isomorphism breaks down; openness matters. REX inflation targeting restores the isomorphism but this may not be desirable. Instead, under domestic and CPI inflation targeting the exchange rate channel can be exploited to enhance the effects of monetary policy. Our results indicate that CPI inflation targeting delivers price stability across the three inflation objectives and will be desirable to a central bank with a high aversion to inflation instability. CPI inflation targeting also does a better job of stabilizing the real exchange rate and interest rate which is an advantage from the standpoint of financial stability. REX inflation targeting does well in achieving output stability and has an advantage if demand shocks are predominant. In general, the choice of the inflation objective affects the trade-offs between policy goals and thus policy choices and outcomes.","[Froyen, Richard T.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, CB3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Guender, Alfred V.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Canterbury,"Froyen, RT (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, CB3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",froyen@email.unc.edu; alfred.guender@canterbury.ac.nz,,"Guender, Alfred/0000-0001-6234-5643",,,,,35,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We show that subjective well-being explains variation in voting intention that goes beyond what is captured by these monetary and financial indicators. For example, individuals who are satisfied with their life are 1.6% more likely to support the incumbent; by contrast, a 10% increase in family income leads to a 0.18% increase in an individual's support of the incumbent. We use difference-in-differences analysis to identify how voter intention is affected by a negative shock to well-being: the death of a spouse. Individuals who experience the death of a spouse are around 10% less likely than those in the control group to support the incumbent. The results hold even if elected officials' policies (health care, social welfare) cannot reasonably be blamed for the death. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, foreign firms, including those with investments that yield firm-specific above-normal returns, have a large number of alternative investment opportunities; this suggests that the supply of foreign direct investment is highly elastic, which implies that small open economies should avoid imposing any source-based taxes on capital income. On the other hand, governments invariably want to tax any above-normal returns earned by location-specific capital, especially if the returns accrue to foreigners, and to take full advantage of the potential revenue increase from any treasury transfer effect that arises due to residence-based tax systems with foreign tax credits, such as that utilized by the USA. These factors suggest that investment is highly inelastic with respect to capital taxation, so that source-based capital income taxation is desirable; indeed, in one special case, the capital income tax rate for a small open economy should equal the relatively high US tax rate. Moreover, this difficult trade-off is in practice complicated by numerous additional factors: deferral of unrepatriated profits and cross-crediting of foreign tax credits for the US multinationals, foreign direct investment from firms from countries that, unlike the USA, operate territorial systems, and the existence of opportunities for both international capital income shifting and labor income shifting. In this paper, we analyze optimal capital income taxation in a small open economy model that attempts to balance these conflicting factors.","[McKeehan, Margaret K.; Zodrow, George R.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ MS22, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Zodrow, George R.] Rice Univ, Baker Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX USA; [Zodrow, George R.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",Rice University; Rice University; University of Oxford,"McKeehan, MK (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ MS22, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",mkm1@rice.edu; zodrow@rice.edu,"Zodrow, George/JCP-2735-2023","McKeehan, Margaret/0000-0003-2048-8413",,,,,66,2,4,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Nevertheless, the transport sector has also shown the fastest growth in energy consumption in the European Union and its contribution to increasing greenhouse gas emissions merits the thorough attention of academics and policy makers. In this paper we analyze the relationship of economic growth and transport activities with transport final energy consumption. Energy Kuznets curves are estimated for a panel data set covering the EU27 countries in the period 1995-2009 for total transport energy use, household transport energy use, and productive transport energy use (all three in absolute and per capita energy use terms). The productive transport energy use and gross value added relationship are further considered as per hour worked. Finally, the control variables of energy prices and differences in the economic structures are tested. Empirical results show that the elasticity of transport energy use with respect to gross value added in per capita terms decreases from a threshold for the three transport energy consumption variables, but the turning point of improved environmental quality is not reached in any instance.

This paper shows how the optimal mix of monetary and fiscal policy depends on these country-specific financial frictions. To this end, we build a two-country DSGE-model of a monetary union. Financial frictions are captured by the cost channel approach. We show that the traditional solution to the assignment problem - the common central bank stabilizes the inflation rate at the union level and the national fiscal authorities stabilize the national economies does not hold in a world with financial frictions. The cost channel decreases the efficiency of monetary policy and increases the need for fiscal stabilization even at the union level. Moreover, the more heterogeneous the union, the more important is fiscal policy in stabilizing shocks. Finally, we evaluate the scenarios in terms of welfare of the representative household.","[Palek, Jakob] Dubliner Str 1, D-60327 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schwanebeck, Benjamin] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34127 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Palek, J (通讯作者)，Dubliner Str 1, D-60327 Frankfurt, Germany.",j.palek@gmx.net; schwanebeck@uni-kassel.de,,"Schwanebeck, Benjamin/0000-0002-0387-9036",,,,,42,7,7,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The overall goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of changes in China's off farm employment on one aspect of the performance of China's agricultural sector: the emergence of specialization in farming. To achieve this goal, we have three specific objectives. First, we document the changes in the flow of labor out of China's villages. Second, we examine how specialization in farming has changed over time. Third, we examine the association between off farm labor flows and specialization. Using panel data from a national representative data collected by the authors between 1999 and 2008, the analysis finds that off farm employment is indeed rising rapidly. At the same time, specialization is occurring off and on the farm. There is a strong and robust correlation between off farm employment and on farm specialization. The results imply that China's agriculture has responded dynamically to the modernization happening elsewhere in the economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Managers with financial constraints raise funds from investors and select a project that is characterized by the degree of risk. Managers differ in their ability to determine the probability of success. Based on past performance, all agents revise beliefs about managers' ability, and the beliefs affect the availability of funds in the future. This provides motivation for managers to build reputation by manipulating their performance through project selection. We show that the quality of investor protection changes fund flows, thereby influencing managers' project selection.

The paper brings a deeper analysis of destination management functioning in the Czech Republic, especially functioning of particular destination management organizations. A survey via questionnaire among existing destination management organizations in the Czech Republic is used as the method for getting relevant data. The results are completed by additional data acquired via analysis of information reported in public registers and on websites of examined organizations.

We find that all variables are stationary and mean reverting, but exhibit long-term memory. Our results suggest that both coal and oil combustion emissions have the weakest degree of long-range dependence, while emissions from gas and gas flaring have the strongest. With evidence of long memory, we conclude that transitory policy shocks are likely to have long-lasting effects, but not permanent effects. Accordingly, permanent effects on CO2 emissions require a more permanent policy stance. In this context, if one were to rely only on testing for stationarity and non-stationarity, one would likely conclude in favour of non-stationarity, and therefore that even transitory policy shocks have permanent effects. Our fractional-integration analysis highlights that this is not the case.","[Belbute, Jose M.] Univ Evora, Dept Econ, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal; [Belbute, Jose M.] Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ CEFAGE, Evora, Portugal; [Pereira, Alfredo M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA USA",University of Evora; William & Mary,"Belbute, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, Dept Econ, Largo Colegiais 2, P-7000803 Evora, Portugal.",jbelbute@uevora.pt,"Belbute, José Manuel Madeira/P-6256-2019","Belbute, José Manuel Madeira/0000-0001-8738-0592; Belbute, Jose/0000-0002-6877-0218",FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013]; FEDER/COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659],FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),The first author would like to acknowledge financial support from FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [grant UID/ECO/04007/2013] and FEDER/COMPETE (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659).,,45,33,33,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A model based on three waves (2011, 2013 and 2015) and over 36,000 responses from the biennial panel study of Polish households - Social Diagnosis - provided data for these forecasts. Based on the fact that transitions between latent states are shaped by previous latent states and socio-economic covariates - age of household head, income and number of household members - we were able to demonstrate LTM as a tool to generate aggregate predictions for both medium- and long-term evolution of the household credit market. The declining tendency for household credit participation rates in Poland is expected in the longer term. In particular, the trend should be supported by decline in the proportion of mortgage debtors. The groups of households indebted for the consumption of durables and those seeking credit outside the banking sector are the groups predicted to remain stable or increase in size.","[Bialowolski, Piotr] Univ Turin, Dept Econ Social Math & Stat Sci, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Bialowolski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ Social Math & Stat Sci, Turin, Italy.",pbialowo@unito.it,"Bialowolski, Piotr/AAI-8393-2020","Bialowolski, Piotr/0000-0003-4102-0107",Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-PEOPLE COFUND] - Researchers: Train 2 Move (T2M) [609402],Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-PEOPLE COFUND] - Researchers: Train 2 Move (T2M),This work was supported by the Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-PEOPLE COFUND no. 609402 - 2020 Researchers: Train 2 Move (T2M)].,,16,4,4,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The performance results of public sector mostly depend on senior executives` professionalism, competences in leadership, ability to focus and motivate civil servants so they can achieve set goals. Therefore, one of the most important tasks in every country is to create a professional and competent civil service, which would be able to function effectively in a rapidly changing and complex environment. The necessity of well-prepared and competent public senior executives in present modern institutions is increasing. There are many classifications of competences in the scientific literature. Summarizing these classifications of competences, the authors distinguish two main groups of competences: common and strategic. The group of common competences, which are required to take a particular position, consists of the following: personal, social, professional and managerial. Meanwhile, the group of strategic competences consists of: cooperation, single-mindedness, possession of vision and leadership. According to respondents' statements it was determined that in the group of common competences (which consists of personal, social, professional and managerial competences) the least demonstrated competence of senior executives of Lithuanian self-government administrations is the managerial one (involves logical, analytical, systemic thinking and so on). In the group of common competences, social competence oriented towards cooperation, partnership, training and development was assessed as the most positive. During the assessment, it was determined that all criteria of strategic competences group (cooperation, single-mindedness, possession of vision and leadership) were assessed by the respondents as important.","[Blaskova, Martina] Univ Zilina, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Adamoniene, Ruta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Putvinskio St 70, LT-44211 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Petrauskiene, Ruta] Kaunas Univ Technol, A Mickeviciaus St 37, LT-44244 Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Zilina; Mykolas Romeris University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Blaskova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",blaskova@fri.uniza.sk; rutadam@mruni.eu; ruta.petrauskiene@ktu.lt,"Blaskova, Martina/AAH-6338-2020; Blašková, Martina/ABF-3732-2021; Adamonienė, Rūta/V-6784-2019; Blaskova, Martina/I-4527-2018","Blaskova, Martina/0000-0003-2760-9724",,,,,27,2,2,1,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using individual level data from the Swiss Household Panel, health information is proxied by three different types of health events: physical health problems, mental disorders, and accidents. Exploiting retrospectively reported information on smoking behaviour, smoking cessation is modelled using a discrete time hazard model that also accounts for estimation problems arising from almost quasi-complete separation in the data. The empirical results yield robust evidence that general health problems increase the probability of instantaneous smoking cessation. Differentiating between the type of health event reveals that the overall effect is mainly driven by physical health events.","[Buennings, Christian] CINCH, RWI, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Buennings, Christian] Univ Paderborn, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Bünnings, C (通讯作者)，CINCH, RWI, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.;Bünnings, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",christian.buennings@upb.de,,,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung.,,50,3,3,1,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Yet, the extent to which theory explains the equilibrating forces in markets remains under-researched, especially in the developing world. We set up a laboratory in 94 villages in rural Sierra Leone to mimic a real market. We implement several treatments, varying trading partners and the anonymity of trading. We find that when trading with co-villagers average efficiency is somewhat lower than predicted by theory (and observed in different contexts), and markets do not fully converge to theoretical predictions across rounds of trading. When participants trade with strangers efficiency is reduced more. Anonymizing trade within the village does not affect efficiency. This points to the importance of behavioral norms for trade. Intra-village social relationships or hierarchies, instead, appear less important as determinants of trading outcomes. This is confirmed by analysis of the trader-level data, showing that individual earnings in the experiment do not vary with one's status or position in local networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is shown in a general model in which the agent's type stochastically evolves over time, and her payoff (which is linear in transfers) depends on the entire history of private and any contractible information, contractible decisions, and her hidden actions. The contract is offered by the principal in the presence of initial informational asymmetry. The model can be transformed into an equivalent one where the agent's subsequent information is independent in each period (type orthogonalization). We show that for any fixed decision-action rule implemented by a mechanism, the agent's rents (as well as the principal's maximal revenue) are the same as if the principal could observe and contract on the agent's orthogonalized types after the initial period. We also show that any monotonic decision-action rule can be implemented in a Markovian environment satisfying certain regularity conditions, and we provide a simple recipe for solving such dynamic contracting problems.","[Eso, Peter] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Szentes, Balazs] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Eso, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England.",peter.eso@economics.ox.ac.uk; b.szentes@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,18,22,0,3,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Thus, we find that the regulatory environment could be improved by eliminating costly measures that do not affect quality of care.","[Gorry, Devon] Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Thomas, Diana W.] Creighton Univ, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Creighton University,"Thomas, DW (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",dianathomas@creighton.edu,"Thomas, Diana/AAA-8434-2019","Thomas, Diana/0000-0002-7912-9928; Gorry, Devon/0000-0003-1933-9111",,,,,37,9,12,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A safe asset is an asset that is (almost always) valued at face value without expensive and prolonged analysis. By design, there is no benefit to producing (private) information about its value, and this is common knowledge. Consequently, agents need not fear adverse selection when buying or selling safe assets. Safe assets can be easily used to exchange for goods or services or for another asset. These short-term safe assets can be money or money-like. A long-term safe asset can store value over time or be used as collateral. Much of human history can be written in terms of the search for and production of safe assets. But the most prevalent, privately produced short-term safe assets, bank debts, are subject to runs, and this has important implications for macroeconomics and for monetary policy.","[Gorton, Gary] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Gorton, Gary] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Gorton, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Gorton, G (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gary.gorton@yale.edu,,,,,,,210,68,84,1,15,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

We apply our analysis to individual-level longitudinal patient data from Australia, focusing on three popular procedures that are performed in both public and private hospitals. We find 4-5 patient types. The most common types use either a public or a private hospital almost exclusively and absorb a moderate level of hospital resources. The severe types represent 13-17% of patients. The type which uses both sectors makes up 10-20% and tends to have private health insurance coverage. The patient types are predictive of prospective utilizations as we find that patients tend to be admitted to the sector they have used in the past. By revealing how patients use coexisting public and private hospitals, our results have direct implications on health resource financing and allocations.","[Gu, Megan; Johar, Meliyanni] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Johar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",Meliyanni.Johar@uts.edu.au,,"Gu, Megan/0000-0002-2522-3900","ARC [DP110100729, DE140100719]; Australian Research Council [DE140100719] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the ARC; [DP110100729 and DE140100719].,,41,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The costs are equivalent to 12% of the total property returns on average, ranging from 9.5% to 29.5% of property prices depending on the illiquidity level and market conditions. However, when amortized by holding periods, monthly illiquidity costs are on average 0.08%, and illiquidity risk does not appear to be priced in residential properties; illiquid properties do not show higher returns than liquid properties. On the contrary, we find evidence of flight-to-quality in bull markets, that is, high-quality illiquid properties are preferred to low-quality liquid properties in buoyant markets.

The same relation works for (past) knowledge-accumulated capital in other (non-clean) technologies. However, the relation's impact on the number of clean inventions produced is much lower.

Modelling the volatility is crucial because the volatility is an important variable for asset allocation, risk management and derivative pricing. We develop a SV model comprising a latent common volatility factor with two asymptotic regimes with a smooth transition between them. In contrast to conventional volatility models, SVs are generated by the logistic transformation of latent factors, which comprise two components: the common volatility factor and an idiosyncratic component. We present a SV model with a common factor for oil, corn and wheat from 8 August 2005 to 10 October 2014, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the SVs and extract the common volatility factor. We find that the volatilities of oil and grain markets are persistent. According to the estimated common volatility factor, high volatility periods match the 2007-2009 recession and the 2007-2008 financial crisis quite well.

The sample consists of 62 developed and developing countries, using the ordinary least squares robust standard error estimations, instrumental variable (IV) estimators, and quantile regression. The empirical results indicate that formal institutions and social capital complement one another in influencing countries' innovations level. In terms of the relative importance of both in promoting innovation activities, the social capital has greater role compared to formal institutions. Furthermore, the empirical result suggests that innovation level tends to be higher in countries with higher social capital. We also use the quantile regression to estimate whether the relationship among formal institutions, social capital, and innovation differs at different points in the conditional distribution of innovation. The results demonstrate that formal institutions yield a significant positive impact only after exceeding in 50th quantile, whereas social capital do so at lower 10th quantile. Therefore, in addition to a policy focus on improving the formal institutions, countries with a low level of innovation should enrich social capital in their promotion of innovation activity.","[Lee, Weng Chang] INTI Int Coll, Sch Business, Subang, Selangor, Malaysia; [Law, Siong Hook] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",INTI International University; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Law, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",lawsh@upm.edu.my,"Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883; Lee, Weng Chang/0000-0002-6001-6405",Group Putra Grant (GP-IPB) Universiti Putra Malaysia [9440902],Group Putra Grant (GP-IPB) Universiti Putra Malaysia,We are grateful for the financial support from the Group Putra Grant (GP-IPB 2014) [grant number 9440902] Universiti Putra Malaysia.,,78,28,29,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Thus referring to air emissions accounts, the aim of this analysis is to evaluate changes in CO2 equivalent emissions from the production-based perspective in Lithuania and the EU-27 and their determinants during 2000- 2012. Using the coefficient of elasticity, it was observed that in Lithuanian the economy grew three times faster than emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Meanwhile in the EU-27, GHG decreased with economic growth. In the EU-27 absolute decoupling was observed for agriculture, forestry and fishing, public administration, defence economic activities, real estate activities, and education. Meanwhile, in Lithuania for these activities a relative or negative decoupling occurred. With regard to technological contributions to changes in CO2 equivalent emissions, the most problematic economic activities in Lithuania are financial and insurance activities, education, post and telecommunications, other service activities. In the EU-27 members the most problematic sectors are mining and quarrying, construction, transport and storage sector. Thus, the successful implementation of GHG emissions management policy is very important in Lithuania and in all the EU countries.","[Liobikiene, Genovaite; Bernatoniene, Jurga; Savickas, Arunas] Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Drug Technol & Social Pharm, Eiveniu G 4, LT-50009 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Mandravickaite, Justina] Balt Inst Adv Technol, Sauletekio Al 15, LT-10224 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Krepstuliene, Danguole] Dept Stat Agr & Environm Stat Lithuania, Gedimino Pr 29, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian University of Health Sciences,"Liobikiene, G (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Drug Technol & Social Pharm, Eiveniu G 4, LT-50009 Kaunas, Lithuania.",g.liobikiene@gmf.vdu.lt,"Liobikiene, Genovaite/I-9276-2019; Mandravickaitė, Justina/AAD-5922-2022","Liobikiene, Genovaite/0000-0002-9361-2609;",,,,,52,13,13,4,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

To regulate the resource taxation system and reduce the burden of coal enterprises, the Chinese government launched a reform of its resource tax system in 2014 for coal, introducing the ad valorem system to replace the volume-based system that had been in place for the preceding thirty years. To assess the impact of the tax reform, this paper constructs two-stage dynamic game models by taking the coal and coal-fired power industries as the players. The market situations of shortage and oversupply are investigated separately. Empirical data are collected to estimate the model parameters for numerical simulations. The model results suggest that the tax reform will reduce both coal prices and the coal industry profitability if the tax levied on each ton of coal is maintained at the same level as before the reform, regardless of whether the market is in a shortage or an oversupply situation. However, the increased buyer's power will amplify the effect of the tax reform. The numerical simulations also provide an estimation of the tax rate of the ad valorem system that maintains the profit of the coal industry. Considering the demand and supply situations in China's coal market, policy recommendations are provided to guide further reform of China's resource tax system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results reveal that (1) educational factors are significantly spatially autocorrelated. Educational factors have spatial spillover effects. Regional differences of education impacts still exist. (2) Average schooling year has a more positive effect on economic output than capital investment and labor force. Basic education might play a more important role in economic growth.

Although we find that average nominal prices remain static throughout our sample period, quality of service has risen dramatically over time, particularly with respect to download speed. Some characteristics of broadband plans exhibit broadly stable valuations over time, but the elasticity of price with respect to advertised download speed and the premium on bundled services declined for most types of broadband plans during the sample period.

When corporate tax rates differ between the home country and the foreign country, the possibility of shifting income and reducing overall tax payments through transfer pricing makes integration more attractive than outsourcing. This paper develops an incomplete-contracting model in which an international firm facing tax rate differentials chooses whether or not to internalize intermediate transactions in order to trade off production efficiency and tax minimization. By shifting economic activities across borders, an integrated multinational enterprise establishes a proper transfer price and reaches the optimal profit-splitting arrangement that maximizes its total after-tax profit. This paper finds that cross-country differences in corporate tax rates and product intangibility play important roles in affecting firms' internalization decision. Empirical analysis employing the US data also supports the theoretical findings. The positive correlation of the integration level of US firms and tax rate differentials between the US and foreign countries remains in the sample excluding tax havens.","[Ma, Xiangjun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Ma, XJ (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xm2e@virginia.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503045]; Beijing Social Science Funding [15JGC158],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Funding,This project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503045] and Beijing Social Science Funding [15JGC158],,40,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

During the crisis, the risk of cascading failures of financial organizations has dramatically increased, thus causing a return of attention to local banking as a possible source of countercyclical behaviours in the financial markets thanks to their ability to establish fiduciary long-term relationships with small businesses. The purpose of this article is to test this hypothesis and to disentangle the response of local banks during the financial turmoil according to their governance structure and location. Our results show that non-independent local banks and, to a limited extent, cooperative banks located in the rural area actually played a significant countercyclical role across the crisis.

The target users of this model are primarily people in companies with decision-making power in the investment field. The appropriate starting point based on the multi-criteria evaluation was the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach for cloud computing (CC).

In this article, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of these types of models using male and female data from 30 countries and using the theory of structural breaks to identify changes in the extracted trends by time. We find that structural breaks are present in a substantial number of cases, that they are more prevalent in male data than in female data, that the introduction of additional period factors into the model reduces their presence, and that allowing for changes in the trend improves the fit and forecast substantially.","[O'hare, Colin] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Li, Youwei] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland",Monash University; Queens University Belfast,"Li, YW (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland.",colin.ohare@monash.edu,"Li, Youwei/K-1898-2014","Li, Youwei/0000-0002-2142-7607",Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP130103210],Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by Australian Research Council (ARC) under Discovery Grant (DP130103210) is gratefully acknowledged.,,33,2,2,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This fact is at odds with most unified theories of industrialization, which tend to imply rising skill premia as natural concomitants of economic growth. This paper develops a very simple model of historical growth to help solve this puzzle. Assuming that human capital is both a consumption good and an investment good, the model demonstrates how gradually rising investments in human capital, nonmonotonic fertility rates, and falling skill premia can all be explained within one theory.","[Rahman, Ahmed S.] US Naval Acad, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy,"Rahman, AS (通讯作者)，US Naval Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA.",rahman@usna.edu,,,,,,,67,1,3,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

For general and sectoral renewable energy indices for the period 2006-2015, our findings indicate that dependence between oil and renewable energy returns in the short run was weak but gradually strengthened towards the long run, mainly for the period 2008-2012. Our causality tests provide evidence against linear causality at higher frequencies and in favour of unidirectional and bidirectional linear causality at lower frequencies. In contrast, we found consistent evidence of non-linear causality running from renewable energy indices to oil prices at different time horizons and mixed evidence of causality running from oil to renewable energy prices. These results have potential implications for investors in terms of hedging and for policymakers in terms of policy support decisions regarding the development of renewable energy.

This approach skips the labour-intensive step of detailing and harmonising country tables. Adherence metrics reveal the EXIOBASE2-based IELab table to be considerably less balanced than the original but with stronger adherence to other constraints data. However, these metrics are not comparable to the original EXIOBASE2 statistics due to the distinctive implementation of constraint sets in the two platforms. IELab's main value-added is its flexibility in tailoring EXIOBASE2-based MRIOs beyond the original recipe. Finally, IELab's global carbon, water and material footprints are shown to be comparable with previously reported resource footprints.

But for model parameter values which are realistic for the wage-led eurozone, higher real wages reduce employment growth. Contrariwise, real wage restraint in a weakly wage-led economy generates jobs -as recent European experience underscores.

Although the direct link between electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and purchase intention has been considered, few studies have examined the benefits of eWOM on brand image and perceived value in order to facilitate this link. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of eWOM on brand image and perceived value to enhance purchase intention from the view of social capital theory. Using a sample of 379 consumers from smartphone sector in Vietnam, the study identifies how brand image, perceived value are enhancing purchase intention by the effect of eWOM. The findings have implications for the use of eWOM to foster the relationship between brand image, perceived value, and purchase intention.

This aspect differentiates options from other derivatives. Since pricing and hedging of plain vanilla options under the conditions of Gaussian distribution (or a so called Black-Scholes model) is already well documented, it commonly serves as a benchmark for developing of new approaches and methods, which, in fact, aims on options with more complex payoffs (exotic options) and/or probability distributions that fit empirical observations about the market prices better, but for which no analytical formula is available. Obviously, being able to compare the results of the novel model with theoretically correct one is a crucial step of model testing. In this contribution we focuse on numerical pricing of options. We first review well known approaches of Monte Carlo simulation and Lattice models and subsequently we formulate a Black-Scholes-Merton Partial Differential Equation, which serves as a starting point for discretization via two novel approaches, discontinuous Galerkin approach and Fuzzy transform technique. Both approaches seems to be promising especially for complex processes and payoff functions.","[Tichy, Tomas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic; [Hozman, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Sci Humanities & Educ, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic; [Holcapek, Michal] Univ Ostrava, Inst Res & Applicat Fuzzy Modeling, Ctr Excellence IT4Innovat, 30 Dubna 1404-22, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University Liberec; University of Ostrava,"Tichy, T (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",tomas.tichy@vsb.cz; jiri.hozman@tul.cz; michal.holcapek@osu.cz,"Holcapek, Michal/AAV-9459-2021; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330;",Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [16-09541S]; SGS research project of VSB-TU Ostrava [SP2017/32],Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); SGS research project of VSB-TU Ostrava,"All authors were supported through the Czech Science Foundation (GACR) under project 16-09541S.

Combined data for trade transactions and for characteristics of a representative large sample of trading firms are then used to report differences between firms that export and import different goods only (inter-good traders) and firms that engage in the simultaneous export and import of identical goods (intra-good traders). We find that the share of intra-good trade in total trade was some 17% in Germany in 2012. Intra-good trade matters. This share differs widely between broadly defined groups of goods and between industries. Controlling for detailed industry affiliation, intra-good traders differ significantly from inter-good traders - they are larger, more human capital intensive, more productive, have a higher R&D intensity and are more profitable. The data, however, are not rich enough to reveal the direction of causality between intra-good trade and firm performance and to investigate empirically the reasons why some firms engage in intra-good trade.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] KTH Stockholm, CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg; Royal Institute of Technology,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020; Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this research, we propose a novel approach, which combines GM(1,1) with a two-stage super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM) model, to forecast and assess the efficiencies of 18 EMSs. The GM(1,1) was first used to forecast future data of EMSs, and then the two-stage super-efficiency SBM model was used to measure the marketability and profitability efficiencies for an EMU in two stages. The results build a past-current-future' view on the two efficiencies for each EMS. In addition, the profitability efficiency can help justify the reasonability of marketability efficiency. Our results showed that Hon Hai tops the rankings in both profitability and marketability efficiencies. These results also provided information about relative efficiencies of these EMSs, which helps EMS managers and investors to make better decisions.","[Wang, Chia-Nan] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wang, Chia-Nan] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Hsu, Hsien-Pin] Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wang, Yen-Hui] Chihlee Univ Technol, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Thi-Thu-Huyen Pham] Foxconn Elect Inc, Honi, Vietnam",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Ton Duc Thang University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Hon Hai Precision Industry,"Hsu, HP (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",hphsu@webmail.nkmu.edu.tw,"Hsu, Hsien-Pin/T-4832-2019","Wang, Chia-Nan/0000-0002-2374-3830",,,,,28,8,9,3,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The article makes several findings. First, Klein built on the pioneering efforts of Wesley Mitchell to advance the development of cycle indicators and to outline an eclectic theory of cycles that remains useful for synthesizing a broad literature. Second, Klein's essays on macroeconomics contain enduring discussions of the malleability of the natural rate of unemployment and the value of a behavioral approach to expectations. Third, he refocused the institutionalist attention on the public sector by introducing higher efficiency and other concepts to help explain how government policy plays a role in economic life. Fourth, Klein emphasized the role of fiscal policy in moderating business cycles. Fifth, his work points in the direction of today's post-Keynesian institutionalism, both by stressing that Keynes was profoundly institutionalist in his approach and by arguing that conjoining Keynes and institutionalism would provide a stronger foundation for macroeconomic theory and policy.","[Whalen, Charles J.] SUNY Buffalo, Baldy Ctr Law & Social Policy, Buffalo, NY 14226 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Whalen, CJ (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Baldy Ctr Law & Social Policy, Buffalo, NY 14226 USA.",,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

First of all, 14 antecedent conditions of the project performance are extracted through the review on the existing research. Secondly, a cross-tabulation analysis is carried out to explore the main and contrarian effects of the antecedent conditions based on the data obtained from the Chinese leading crowdfunding platform, JingDong Crowdfunding. In the following section, the qualitative comparative analysis process is conducted for the antecedent conditions, followed by the test on the predictive validity of the configurational models. Finally, the implications for both research and practice have been discussed. We find evidence that each antecedent condition exercises both main and contrarian effects on the financing performance. And the influence stemming from a single antecedent factor is confirmed to depend on the attribute combination it exists rather than remains stable. Furthermore, the number of progress updates and the number of history investments are the most important positive factors, while the financing goal and the minimum pledge amount are the most important negative ones. This study helps expand the crowdfunding performance research field by adopting the qualitative comparative analysis method on the one hand, while on the other hand, it provides a clearer understanding about the configurational impact on the financing performance from the asymmetrical perspective.

Based on the cost-of-carry model, we first show that there exist three arbitrage regimes in Australia's REIT spot-futures price dynamics. Further analysis indicates that the two thresholds, which separate the regimes, are largely consistent with the level dictated by transaction costs. We then estimate a threshold vector error correction model (TVECM). The results show that mean reversion of the mispricing error only takes place in the two outer regimes. Furthermore, we find evidence that REIT spot market is more informationally efficient than the futures market. Given its short history, it will take time for REIT index futures market to mature. Finally, we find that we can enhance hedging performance by accommodating the feature of threshold cointegration displayed by the data. As the futures-spot relationship differs across regimes, we can develop a hedging strategy by adjusting the hedge ratio based on arbitrage regimes. It leads to a greater variance reduction for the hedged portfolio than some conventional methods examined in the existing real estate literature.","[Zhou, Jian] Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Real Estate & Housing, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Zhou, J (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Real Estate & Housing, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",jian@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Compared to previous studies, this article, based on data before and after the 2008 global financial crisis, presents a more detailed analysis, as we investigate the spillovers in terms of returns, volatilities and exchange rates between the renminbi (RMB) and the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) throughout the entire conditional return distribution, including the central quantiles, which are closely related to the normal circumstances, and the extreme quantiles, which correspond to the bear and bull markets. First, we find that the return spillovers from its lagged returns or from the other index not only vary across time but also depend on stock state. Second, while return volatility may boost the stock market in a bull market, it accelerates the decline in a bear market. Third, the depreciation of the RMB relative to the HKD does not significantly affect current returns for the HSI, while it negatively affects current returns for the SCI in a bad state after the crisis. The findings presented in this article will facilitate investors' understanding of the two stock markets.","[Zhu, Huiming; Tang, Yueli; Guo, Peng] Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Zhu, HM (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhuhuiming@hnu.edu.cn,"Guo, Peng/GWC-0572-2022; guo, peng/AAG-4052-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171075, 71431008, 71521061]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant Numbers 71171075, 71431008, 71521061].",,35,6,6,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We first decompose the observed changes in poverty reduction into components arising from growth, improved income distribution, and heterogeneous inflation. We find the component of inflation to be non-negligible and highly detrimental to the poor, as the inflation experienced by them has been higher than the national average since 2008. The decomposition also shows improvement in income distribution to be the main contributor to poverty reduction in Mexico. In the second part of our analysis, we compile a unique panel dataset at the state level from the household data and estimate a system of equations that characterize the dynamic relationship between growth, inequality, and poverty, being careful to avoid spurious correlation arising from data construction. The GMM regression results show that Mexican states are characterized by income and inequality convergence, that lower levels of inequality tend to spur growth in the economy, that increasing income/consumption levels contribute to reducing inequality, and that poverty reduction is highly determined by inequality levels in the previous period. This implies that once a small perturbation occurs in a state that improves the distribution of income, the state is expected to experience sustained income growth and accelerated poverty reduction simultaneously in subsequent periods.","[Iniguez-Montiel, Alberto Javier] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kurosaki, Takashi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",University of Tokyo; Hitotsubashi University,"Iniguez-Montiel, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",iniguez@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Kurosaki, Takashi/0000-0002-9762-0067",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewer of this journal, Carlos A.

(iii) Do the price and interest rate effects hold if controls for non-parity factors are embedded in tests? The data series for this study are taken over 55 years covering pre-and-post-Bretton Woods era: a second test was done over the post-Bretton Woods period only using 30 years of data. Also, the traditional factors of parity conditions are extended in this research to take into account recently theorized and tested non-parity factors related to cash flows. The resulting evidence affirms clearly that both the parity factors (prices and interest rates) and the non-parity factors affect exchange rates significantly over the long run, also over the 30-year period. In our view, these findings extend our knowledge of how currency behavior is consistent with parity and non-parity theorems.","[Ariff, Mohamed] Bond Univ, Fac Business, 14 Univ Dr, Robina, Qld 4229, Australia; [Ariff, Mohamed] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43300, Malaysia; [Zarei, Alireza] Sunway Univ, Jalan Univ, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia",Bond University; Universiti Putra Malaysia; Sunway University,"Ariff, M (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Fac Business, 14 Univ Dr, Robina, Qld 4229, Australia.",ariff13@gmail.com; alizeza.67@gmail.com,"Ariff, Mohamed/U-6072-2019; ZAREI, ALIREZA/A-2530-2016; ZAREI, ALIREZA/M-5790-2019","ZAREI, ALIREZA/0000-0002-2843-798X",,,,,40,0,0,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We exploit the fact that US states can set top-up rates, which means that at a given point in time, workers with the same income receive different tax refunds in different states. Using event studies as well as a border pair design, we document that raising the state EITC leads to more bunching of self-employed tax filers at the first kink point of the tax schedule. While we document a strong relationship up until 2007, we find no effect during the Great Recession.

This departs from the empirical literature that focuses mainly on the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies during this episode, although these policies are appropriate only to the extent that the conventional policy was ineffective in the first place. Our identification strategy based on the conditional heteroskedasticity of the structural innovations allows us to specify a flexible structural vector auto-regressive process that relaxes the identifying assumptions commonly used in earlier studies. Comparing our results obtained from samples excluding and including the financial crisis, we find that the conventional monetary policy has lost its effectiveness shortly after the beginning of the financial turmoil. This result suggests that the Fed's use of unconventional policies was appropriate, at least, with the objective of changing the term structure of interest rates.","[Cenesizoglu, Tolga] Alliance Manchester Business Sch, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada; [Cenesizoglu, Tolga; Larocque, Denis; Normandin, Michel] HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Cenesizoglu, T (通讯作者)，Alliance Manchester Business Sch, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.;Cenesizoglu, T (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",tolga.cenesizoglu@hec.ca,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Focusing on emerging markets, we ask whether this conventional wisdom still holds in our contemporary world. Our results show that, despite recent structural and regulatory changes, much of it survives. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are more stable than non-FDI inflows. Within non-FDI inflows, portfolio debt and bank-intermediated flows remain the most volatile. Whereas FDI inflows are driven mainly by pull factors, portfolio debt and equity are driven mainly by push factors; bank-intermediated flows are driven a combination of push and pull factors. Capital outflows from emerging markets behave differently, however. FDI outflows from emerging markets have grown and become significantly more volatile. There is similarly an increase in the volatility of bank-intermediated capital outflows from emerging markets. Our findings underscore that outflows from emerging markets, both FDI and bank-related flows, have come to play a growing role and warrant greater attention from analysts and policymakers.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Poonam; Masetti, Oliver] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; The World Bank,"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",eichengr@berkeley.edu; pgupta5@worldbank.org; omasetti@worldbank.org,,,,,,,5,20,21,0,39,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Using urban construction investment bonds (UCIBs) issued by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), we study how intergovernmental fiscal transfers impact the issuance of UCIBs under China's unitary currency system. Applying instrumental variable estimation, we find that special-purpose fiscal transfers per capita are positively associated with the issuance of UCIBs. A one-RMB increase in special-purpose fiscal transfers per capita is associated with an increase in the issuance of UCIBs per capita of 0.282 RMB, whereas regular fiscal transfers (including tax rebates and general fiscal transfers) do not affect the issuance of UCIBs. Furthermore, the effect of special-purpose fiscal transfers on the issuance of UCIBs mainly exists in inland cities rather than coastal cities. This imposes risks of eurozonization for the Chinese economy. We also find a deterioration of refinancing in terms of issuing more UCIBs.","[Lu, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, 1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Huiyong] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Finance, 1900 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Zhong, HY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Finance, 1900 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",luming1973@sjtu.edu.cn; zhonghuiyong@gmail.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [13, ZD015]; Young Scholars Program of Shanghai",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Young Scholars Program of Shanghai,The research reported in this paper was supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (13&ZD015) and the Young Scholars Program of Shanghai.

The positive well-being effects of volunteering are highly heterogeneous, with larger impact at the lower end of the distribution of subjective well-being. Our dynamic analysis shows that the beneficial effects of volunteering are transitory. We find evidence of complete subjective well-being adaptation one year after volunteering. We show that more frequent socialisation, increasing satisfaction with feeling part of local community and rising satisfaction with neighbourhood living in are three channels for the contemporaneous positive linkage between volunteering and subjective well-being.","[Magnani, Elisabetta] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Zhu, Rong] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia",Macquarie University; Flinders University South Australia,"Zhu, R (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia.",lisa.magnani@mq.edu.au; rong.zhu@flinders.edu.au,,"Magnani, Elisabetta/0000-0002-7570-3187; Zhu, Rong/0000-0002-6872-1571",Australian Research Council [ARC DP160101914]; Australian Research Council Linkage Project [ARC LP170100718]; Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Linkage Project(Australian Research Council); Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We collected data from two samples of undergraduate students in 2015 and 2016 using online questionnaires. Our findings contribute to the literature in that they show financial threat (1) positively correlates with acute financial hardships (e.g., reduced income), and this relation is stronger than its relationship with chronic financial conditions (i.e., current income). (2) Financial threat positively correlates with constructive financial behaviors, such as increased willingness to cut expenses. (3) Economic hardship moderates the positive relationship between financial threat and constructive financial behavior. When economic hardship is high, individuals with high and low levels of financial threat are willing to engage in constructive financial behaviors. When hardship is low, however, individuals with high financial threat are the most willing to engage in constructive financial behavior.","[Marjanovic, Zdravko] Concordia Univ Edmonton, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Fiksenbaum, Lisa; Greenglass, Esther] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Marjanovic, Z (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ Edmonton, Dept Psychol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",zdravko.marjanovic@concordia.ab.ca,", Esther/JGM-7246-2023",,,,,,40,5,6,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We examine these questions in an experiment where potential thieves face the possibility of punishment. As a non-monetary sanction, we require convicted individuals to perform a tedious real effort task. In the monetary treatments, sanctions are instead fines, which are based on individuals' willingness to pay to avoid the real effort task to ensure comparability with the non-monetary treatment. The second manipulation in our experiment concerns the balance of errors in the adjudicative procedure (i.e. the conviction of innocents and acquittal of guilty individuals). We find that stealing is reduced most effectively by a sanction regime that combines non-monetary sanctions with a severe procedure. Our data are consistent with the notion that both monetary punishment and pro-defendant sanction regimes are less effective in communicating moral condemnation of an act.","[Rizzolli, Matteo] LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy; [Tremewan, James] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; [Tremewan, James] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Universita LUMSA; University of Auckland; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Rizzolli, M (通讯作者)，LUMSA Univ, Rome, Italy.",m.rizzolli@lumsa.it; james.tremewan@auckland.ac.nz,"Tremewan, James/AAE-4309-2022","Tremewan, James/0000-0002-8011-6366",,,,,75,0,0,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

It analyzes the role of ideas in shaping the evolution of central bank regulation. Particular importance is given to the Bank of England's inconvertibility period, from 1797 to 1821, and the ensuing debate in shaping Robert Peel's Bank Act of 1844, which is often seen as the birth of modern central banking. The importance of the Say's Law, and the inexistence of an alternative theory of the determination of output, is shown to play an essential role in the policy prescriptions of the so-called Bullionist authors, who won the debates that shaped central banking practices in the nineteenth century. The paper concludes with a brief analysis of what is a central bank according to the dominant (marginalist) mainstream of the profession, and what an alternative conception based on what may be termed classical-Keynesian political economy would be.","[Vernengo, Matias] Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Vernengo, M (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, 1 Dent Dr, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",m.vernengo@bucknell.edu,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The share of natural resources in North Korea's exports to China has recently increased. Inter-Korean trade has contributed to improvements in the trade balance and industrialisation of North Korea, which can be contrasted with the pattern of North Korea's exports to China, i.e. the dominance of primary products. The economic sanctions regime against North Korea implemented by the United Nations has significantly reduced the country's foreign exchange earnings.

We motivate our analysis using Becker's model of racial bias, which predicts that rates of pretrial misconduct will be identical for marginal white and marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially unbiased. In contrast, marginal white defendants will have higher rates of misconduct than marginal black defendants if bail judges are racially biased, whether that bias is driven by racial animus, inaccurate racial stereotypes, or any other form of bias. To test the model, we use the release tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to identify the relevant race-specific misconduct rates. Estimates from Miami and Philadelphia show that bail judges are racially biased against black defendants, with substantially more racial bias among both inexperienced and part-time judges. We find suggestive evidence that this racial bias is driven by bail judges relying on inaccurate stereotypes that exaggerate the relative danger of releasing black defendants.","[Arnold, David] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Arnold, D (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,,,,,48,136,189,5,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The reform aimed (among other things) to increase citizens' participation in budgetary decision making and to strengthen public oversight over budget implementation in rural settlements. The experiment provided randomly allocated training and technical assistance to the settlement population and local authorities helping to introduce PB practices into the budgetary cycle. We document that training alone was not successful to ensure an effective implementation of PB. By contrast, training coupled with on-the-ground technical assistance generated full implementation of the PB cycle. Overall, we find that the implementation of PB increased citizen's engagement in public decision making and raised local tax revenue collection. However, we find larger effects when the PB model was implemented in settlements with more years of prior experience with political and administrative decentralization. Among these settlements, we find that PB not only increased citizen's participation and tax revenue collection, but also that preferences for public services between authorities and citizens were better aligned, local administrations allocated larger fractions of public budgets to services identified as top priorities by citizens, and citizens were more satisfied with public services. Our findings highlight: (1) the importance of context specific on-the-ground technical assistance to ensure effective implementation of participatory models; and (2) the relevance of taking the historical and institutional context into account when planning and sequencing meaningful participatory decentralization reforms.","[Beuermann, Diether W.] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Amelina, Maria] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; The World Bank,"Beuermann, DW (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",dietherbe@iadb.org,,,Japanese Social Development Fund at the World Bank; Government of the Russian Federation,Japanese Social Development Fund at the World Bank; Government of the Russian Federation,"Conversations and comments from Ricardo Cavazos, Leah Cohen, Paul Dower, Mark Duggan, Jean Paul Faguet, Frederico Finan, Paul Gertler, Raymond Guiteras, Judith Hellerstein, Gerard Johnson, Melissa Kearney, Stephen Knack, Soohyung Lee, Arianna Legovini, Christopher McKelvey, Peter Murrell, Camilo Pecha, Wallace Oates, Inder Ruprah, John Shea, Emmanuel Skoufias, Imogen Wade, and an anonymous reviewer substantially improved the paper.

Moreover, the effect size differs with defendants' gender.","[Bindler, Anna; Hjalmarsson, Randi] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Bindler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anna.bindler@economics.gu.se; randi.hjalmarsson@economics.gu.se,"Bindler, Anna/ABA-1447-2021","Bindler, Anna/0000-0001-7585-0104",Foundation for Economic Research in West Sweden [2250-242 334 602]; Vetenskapsradet; Swedish Research Council; [446-2014-1735],Foundation for Economic Research in West Sweden; Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council);,"Bindler: Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg, Box 640, 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden (email:anna.bindler@economics.gu.se); Hjalmarsson: Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg, Box 640, 40530 Gothenburg, Sweden (email:randi.hjalmarsson@economics.gu.se).This paper would not have been possible without the tremendous efforts of our research assistants Michael Bekele and Srinidhi Srinivasan, the generous help with the data extraction by Florin Maican, and the financial support for Hjalmarsson of the Foundation for Economic Research in West Sweden (2250-242 334 602), and Vetenskapsradet, the Swedish Research Council, Grants for Distinguished Young Researchers (446-2014-1735).

One way to reduce these costs could be to encourage delegation of giving decisions to better-informed others. At the same time, because it involves a loss of agency, delegating these decisions may reduce one's charitable impulse. Unfortunately, the importance of agency in charitable decisions remains largely unexplored. In this paper we shed light on this issue using a laboratory experiment with real donations in which we systematically vary the monetary and agency costs associated with making informed and effective giving decisions,. Our main finding is that agency seems to play a small role in promoting giving. In particular, people do not reduce donations when giving decisions are made by algorithms that guarantee efficient recipients but limit donors' control over giving recipients. Moreover, we find that participating in giving groups - a weaker form of delegated giving -is also effective in that they are appealing to donors who would not otherwise make informed donations, and thus improves overall effective giving. Our results suggest that one path to promoting effective giving may be to create institutions that facilitate delegated generosity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper suggests an approach based on maximizing posterior expected social welfare, combining insights from (i) optimal policy theory as developed in the field of public finance, and (ii) machine learning using Gaussian process priors. We provide explicit formulas for posterior expected social welfare and optimal policies in a wide class of policy problems. The proposed methods are applied to the choice of coinsurance rates in health insurance, using data from the RAND health insurance experiment. The key trade-off in this setting is between transfers toward the sick and insurance costs. The key empirical relationship the policy maker needs to learn about is the response of health care expenditures to coinsurance rates. Holding the economic model and distributive preferences constant, we obtain much smaller point estimates of the optimal coinsurance rate (18% vs. 50%) when applying our estimation method instead of the conventional sufficient statistic approach.

This paper is devoted to the exact analytical solution of the time-consistent mean-variance portfolio selection with assets that can be all risky in a continuous-time economy, of which the time-consistent global minimum-variance portfolio selection is a special case. Our solution generalizes the studies with a risk-free asset in the sense that one of the risky assets can be set as risk-free. By applying the extended dynamic programming, we manage to derive the exact analytical solution of the time-consistent mean-variance strategy with risky assets via the solution of an Abel differential equation. To stabilize the solution, we derive an analytical expansion for the Abel differential equation with any desired accuracy. In addition, we derive the statistical properties of the optimal strategy and prove a separation theorem. Moreover, we establish the links of time-consistent strategy with pre-commitment and myopic strategies and investigate the curse of dimensionality on the time-consistent strategies. We show that under the low-dimensional setting, the intertemporal hedging demands are significant; however, under the high-dimensional setting, the time-consistent strategies are approximately equivalent to myopic strategies, in the presence of estimation risk. Empirical studies are conducted to illustrate and verify our results.","[Pun, Chi Seng] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Math Sci, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Pun, CS (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Math Sci, Singapore, Singapore.",cspun@ntu.edu.sg,"Pun, Chi Seng/J-3225-2018; Pun, Chi Seng/D-8346-2016","Pun, Chi Seng/0000-0002-7478-6961; Pun, Chi Seng/0000-0002-7478-6961",Nanyang Technological University [M4081840],Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University),This work was supported by the Nanyang Technological University [grant number M4081840].,,28,15,16,0,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Other researchers have argued that a free and unregulated banking system stabilizes NGDP growth as an unintended consequence. We explore this argument in a simple model of a free banking system. We find that a free banking system does indeed stabilize NGDP growth in response to aggregate demand shocks. However, we find that in response to aggregate supply shocks it stabilizes the inflation rate. An implication of this is that, unlike an NGDP-targeting central bank, a free banking system would not allow for disinflation or even deflation in response to a positive aggregate supply shock.

Each such method works as follows. Fix a 0-normalized subjective expected utility representation of every possible preference and assign a vector of individual weights to each profile of beliefs. To compute the social preference at a given preference profile, rank the acts according to the weighted product of the individual 0-normalized subjective expected utilities they yield, where the weights are those associated with the belief profile generated by the preference profile. We show that these social welfare functions are characterized by the weak Pareto principle, a continuity axiom, and the following informational robustness property: the social ranking of two acts is unaffected by the addition of any outcome that every individual deems at least as good as the one she originally found worst. This makes the belief-weighted Nash social welfare functions appealing in contexts where the best relevant outcome for an individual is difficult to identify. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Continuous investments are required to achieve high rates of economic growth, while investments sources are national savings and foreign investments. The national savings level in the Western Balkans (W.B.) is not sufficient to finance radical changes, so external sources, in particular foreign direct investment (F.D.I.), are necessary for the development, as well as the official development assistance (O.D.A.). In view of the European intentions for the Western Balkans Region and the level of economic relations with the European Union, this paper seeks to explore the European Union (E.U.) investments and W.B. development. Results of the panel analysis and V.A.R. model show a statistically significant relationship between G.D.P. per capita and the length of the road network and E.U. investments. This confirms the significance of these development variables for the inflow of investment from the E.U. Panel analysis, explanatory variables of trade openness and signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the E.U. did not prove to be significant for E.U. investments inflow.

Using data for 20 industrial countries over the period 1970Q1-2012Q2 and a discrete-time Weibull duration model, we find that the likelihood of the end of a housing boom or a housing bust increases over time. Additionally, we show that the different phases of the housing market cycle are strongly dependent on the economic activity, but credit market conditions are particularly important in the case of housing booms. The empirical findings also indicate that although housing booms have similar lengths in European and non-European countries, housing busts are typically shorter in European countries. The use of a more flexible specification for the hazard function that is based on cubic splines suggests that it evolves in a nonlinear way. From a policy perspective, our study can be useful for predicting the timing and the length of housing boom-bust cycles.

A negative quality of capital shock in the United States generates a global financial crisis.

We find robust evidence that pupils in single-sex schools outperform their counterparts in coed schools, which could be due to single-sex peers in school and classroom, or unobservable school-level covariates. Focusing on switching schools, we find that the conversion of the pupil gender type from single-sex to coed leads to worse academic outcomes for both boys and girls, conditional on school fixed effects and time-varying observables. While for boys, the negative effect is largely driven by exposure to mixed-gender peers at school-level, it is class-level exposure to mixed-gender peers that explains this disadvantage for girls.","[Dustmann, Christian] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Ku, Hyejin] UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Kwak, Do Won] Korea Univ, Asiat Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Korea University,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",c.dustmann@ucl.ac.uk; h.ku@ucl.ac.uk; dwkwak@korea.ac.kr,,"Ku, Hyejin/0000-0001-7291-4969",,,,,62,12,12,2,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54.0,,,,,,79,99,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.06.005,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000447577200006,0

We use a unique dataset of all Israeli women who graduated college or university during the period 1995-2008 and their husbands to investigate whether the motherhood penalty is the result of a household decision. Thus, we investigate whether the wage gap between husband and wife before they have children affects the decision of which spouse will be the main provider and which will have the main responsibility for childrearing. We find that the couple's initial wage ratio does not affect this decision, since a woman almost always bears the opportunity cost of childrearing even if she has a much higher starting wage than her husband.","[Gafni, Dalit; Siniver, Erez] Coll Management, Sch Econ, 7 Yitzhak Rabin Ave,POB 9017, IL-75190 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel",,"Siniver, E (通讯作者)，Coll Management, Sch Econ, 7 Yitzhak Rabin Ave,POB 9017, IL-75190 Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",dalit@gafni.co.il; sinivr@colman.ac.il,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This perspective is based on the idea that changes in return exhibit decreasing sensitivity, that is, the impact of a change diminishes with the distance from the status quo (or reference point). We begin by demonstrating that when the risk-free rate decreases, DRA increases even among sophisticated subjects. We then provide support for our behavioral model in three experiments in which the risk-free rate is manipulated and demand for risky assets is measured. Experiments 1 and 2 rule out alternative explanations, demonstrating that decreasing sensitivity underlies, at least in part, the effect of the risk-free rate on DRA. Experiment 3 demonstrates the role of decreasing sensitivity when returns are presented in terms of monetary payoffs rather than interest rates.","[Ganzach, Yoav; Wohl, Avi] Tel Aviv Univ, Coller Sch Management, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Wohl, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Coller Sch Management, Tel Aviv, Israel.",yoavgn@post.tau.ac.il; aviwohl@post.tau.ac.il,/H-1473-2017,/0000-0002-9821-9785,Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel,Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel,"We thank Doron Sonsino (the associate editor), two anonymous referees, Ido Erev, Doron Kliger, Hersh Shefrin, Doron Sonsino, Meir Statman and the participants in the First Incentives and Behavior Change Conference (2016) at Tel Aviv University and The Second Israel Behavioral Finance Conference (2017) in Tel Aviv 2017 for helpful comments and suggestions.

In this context, the objective of this paper is to improve the understanding of carbon offset price dynamics in comparison with regular carbon market allowances. We combine a cointegration approach with risk premium considerations to compare the price dynamics of European Union Allowances (EUA) and Certified Emission Reductions (CER) in the second phase of the European carbon market. By taking account of breaks identified in the series, we find that, while the EUA and CER returns present comparable dynamics mainly driven by fuel switching, the long-term relationships between the price of these two types of permits and their drivers differ significantly. Whereas the price of EUA is well explained by a demand effect, the impact of energy prices on the CER price suggests the existence of a supply-side effect for credits. We find that the price elasticity of allowances with regard to the coal and gas prices is negative in time periods of low economic activity and positive during the remaining time. We explain the former with the fact that the market is not tight and the latter with the effect of the economic activity on the price of commodities and energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Through a partial labor search-theoretic model, by explicitly modeling renters and owners, we find an asymmetric effect of the local labor market size on the unemployment hazard rate difference between renters and homeowners. We show that homeownership introduces additional frictions into the labor market especially when the local labor market is weak. We also show that these additional frictions make homeowners less mobile, and they become less likely to accept outside job offers, and more likely to accept local offers. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we find empirical evidence for the theoretical predictions of the model: (i) as local labor market opportunities deteriorate, homeowners become more likely to remain unemployed, (ii) homeowners have lower post unemployment wages than renters in local labor markets.","[Guler, Bulent] Indiana Univ, 100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Taskin, Ahmet Ali] Ulm Univ, Ulm, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Ulm University,"Guler, B (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, 100 S Woodlawn Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bguler@indiana.edu; aalitaskin@gmail.com,,"Taskin, Ahmet Ali/0000-0002-2918-5788",,,,,49,4,6,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54.0,,,,,,191,209,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.08.004,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000447577200012,0

It has however attracted less attention in China largely due to measurement impediment. This study aims to measure intangible investment and examine its contribution to regional economic growth in China. The results show that both the coastal and interior regions in China enjoyed high growth in intangible investment during 2003-2014, especially after the year 2008. Moreover, it is found that regional disparity in intangible capital is widening and that this trend is mainly driven by the enlarging gap in investment in computer software and architecture designs. In addition, it is observed that economic competency capital is neglected in both regions, implying generally poor enterprise management in China. When intangible capital is considered, growth accounting exercises show higher labor productivity growth together with a larger effect of capital deepening in both regions. Coastal regions tend to benefit more from intangible capital due to the advancement of computerization. If the contribution of computer software in the interior region was as large as that in the coast region, labor productivity growth of the interior would be 0.5 percentage points higher than its current level. Finally, the estimates of the contribution of total factor productivity to economic growth would be biased if intangible capital is not considered.","[Li, Qing; Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Econ Discipline, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Wu, YR (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Econ Discipline, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",qing.li@research.uwa.edu.au; yanrui.wu@uwa.edu.au,"Li, Qing/ABC-5174-2020; Li, Qing/AAW-9799-2021; Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Li, Qing/0000-0001-8671-3455; Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",China Scholarship Council (CSC); UWA Business School,China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); UWA Business School,"We would like to thank the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and UWA Business School for supporting this project through a postgraduate scholarship and a research grant.

Heckman-type selection models relax this assumption, but have been criticized because they typically require a selection variable which predicts non-response but not the outcome of interest, and can impose bivariate normality. In this paper we illustrate an application using a copula methodology which does not rely on bivariate normality. We implement this approach in data on HIV testing at a demographic surveillance site in rural South Africa which are affected by non-response. Randomized incentives are the ideal selection variable, particularly when implemented ex ante to deal with potential missing data. However, elements of survey design may also provide a credible method of correcting for non-response bias ex post. For example, although not explicitly randomized, allocation of food gift vouchers during our survey was plausibly exogenous and substantially raised participation, as did effective survey interviewers. Based on models with receipt of a voucher and interviewer identity as selection variables, our results imply that 37% of women in the population under study are HIV positive, compared to imputation-based estimates of 28%. For men, confidence intervals are too wide to reject the absence of non-response bias. Consistent results obtained when comparing different selection variables and error structures strengthen these conclusions. Our application illustrates the feasibility of the selection model approach when combined with survey metadata. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Exploring the criteria used in the initial land allocation in the early 1980s, we argue that our finding of a negative relationship between land holding and permanent migration in terms of hukou change has a causal interpretation. We also contribute to the literature by empirically examining the impact of land holding on temporary and permanent migration decisions simultaneously. We find that land holding reduces the likelihood of permanent migration but has a smaller effect on temporary migration decisions. Using a hypothetical survey question, we find that providing full access to urban social benefits to even landless households would result in only a moderate increase in the number of rural individuals intending to settle permanently in urban areas. Our results suggest that reforms of rural land rights and urban social benefits alone may not be sufficient to attract a large proportion of rural individuals to permanently settle in urban areas.","[Meng, Lei; Zhao, Min Qiang] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Zhao, MQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Fujian Key Lab Stat Sci, MOE Key Lab Econometr, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lm67@xmu.edu.cn; kent_zhao@xmu.edu.cn,,,"Center on Pacific Economies at the University of California, San Diego; Pacific Rim Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403230]","Center on Pacific Economies at the University of California, San Diego; Pacific Rim Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We gratefully acknowledge research funding from the Center on Pacific Economies at the University of California, San Diego and the Pacific Rim Research Program, as well as the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71403230).",,36,35,39,6,53,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

For the period 2009-2016, our evidence shows that oil and electricity prices were major contributors to the dynamics of clean energy stock returns in the USA and the EU, respectively, whereas the other energy prices played a minor role in shaping clean energy stock returns. Furthermore, we find evidence of a symmetric energy price impact, so extreme upward and downward energy price movements had a similar impact on clean energy stock returns. This evidence has potential implications for risk management decision making by energy investors and for policy maker decisions regarding support for clean energy deployment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The Fed employed large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) to fight deflation. How did news of LSAP affect inflationary expectations? If investors believed that LSAP would raise inflation, they would sell assets exposed to inflation and purchase inflation hedges. This would lower the prices of assets that are harmed by inflation and raise the prices of assets that benefit from inflation. Examining the relationship between asset price changes and inflation sensitivities can thus shed light on how financial markets process LSAP news. Results across 60 assets indicate that initially LSAP announcements lowered expected inflation. Only as inflation approached its target did news of LSAP raise expected inflation.","[Thorbecke, Willem] Harvard Univ, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Thorbecke, Willem] Harvard Univ, Ctr Int Dev, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan",,"Thorbecke, W (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Res Inst Econ Trade & Ind, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.;Thorbecke, W (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Ctr Int Dev, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-1 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",willem-thorbecke@rieti.go.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H02532] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,3,3,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

A continuum of players arrives continuously over time, and each player chooses once-and-for-all between a safe action (which succeeds with known probability) and a risky action (which succeeds with fixed but unknown probability, depending on the state of the world). The actions also differ in their costs. Before choosing, a player observes the outcomes of K earlier players. There is always an equilibrium in which success is more likely in the good state, and this alignment property holds whenever the initial generation of players is not well informed about the state. In the case of an outcome-improving innovation (where the risky action may yield a higher probability of success), players take the correct action as K -> infinity. In the case of a cost-saving innovation (where the risky action involves saving a cost but accepting a lower probability of success), inefficiency persists as K -> infinity in any aligned equilibrium. Whether inefficiency takes the form of under-adoption or over-adoption also depends on the nature of the innovation. Convergence of the population to equilibrium may be nonmonotone.","[Wolitzky, Alexander] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Wolitzky, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",wolitzky@mit.edu,,,NSF,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Department of Economics, MIT, 50 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02142 (email: wolitzky@mit.edu).

In this study we investigate the impact of human development indicators such as income per capita and human capital (education level) on natural disaster fatalities (total deaths, total affected and total economic losses) in 79 selected countries. Using dynamic panel data analysis, we found that the level of economic development plays an important role in mitigating the impact of natural disasters such as droughts, earthquakes, extreme temperatures, floods, storms, volcanoes, landslides and wildfires. Other factors that are found to determine the number of natural disaster fatalities include population, population density, unemployment, investment, government consumption, openness, education and corruption. Using the dynamic panel data model, we found that education, investment, government consumption and openness display an inverse relationship, while population and population density have a direct positive relationship.","[Padli, Jaharudin] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Sch Social Dev & Econ Studies, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia; [Habibullah, Muzafar Shah] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Financial Econ Res Ctr, Dept Econ, Seri Kembangan, Malaysia; [Baharom, Abdul H.] Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Res Management Ctr, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; Universiti Putra Malaysia; INCEIF,"Habibullah, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Financial Econ Res Ctr, Dept Econ, Seri Kembangan, Malaysia.",muzafar@upm.edu.my,"Abdul Hamid, Baharom/JVZ-9306-2024; Hamid, Baharom Abdul/AAE-1718-2019","Abdul Hamid, Baharom/0000-0001-7335-9119; Hamid, Baharom Abdul/0000-0001-7335-9119; Padli, Jaharudin/0000-0002-2766-2309; Habibullah, Muzafar Shah/0000-0002-2853-8019",Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia (ERGS) [ERGS/1/2012/SS07/UPM/01/6],Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia (ERGS),Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia (ERGS Grant No. ERGS/1/2012/SS07/UPM/01/6).,,63,21,26,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), this paper implements six case studies of well-known waves of reforms, those of New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, Ireland and Netherlands in the 1990s, and the labor market reforms in Germany in the early 2000s. In four of the six cases, GDP per capita was higher than in the control group as a result of the reforms. No difference between the treated country and its synthetic counterpart could be found in the cases of Denmark and New Zealand, which in the latter case may have partly reflected the implementation of reforms under particularly weak macroeconomic conditions. Overall, also factoring in the limitations of the SCM in this context, the results are suggestive of a positive but heterogenous effect of reform waves on GDP per capita.","[Adhikari, Bibek] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Duval, Romain; Loungani, Prakash] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Hu, Bingjie] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA",Illinois State University; International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Adhikari, B (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",badhik1@ilstu.edu; rduval@imf.org; Bhu1@worldbank.org; ploungani@imf.org,,"Adhikari, Bibek/0000-0002-5698-7575",,,,,39,12,15,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In this paper, I present results from a mixed methods study of the shared cultural knowledge in the Microsoft SharePoint user community, a global knowledge-sharing peer support community with substantial online and offline contexts. Learning, access to experts, and socio-professional motivations drive participation, but how the community provides for its constituents cannot be explain by theorizing the community as strictly a nonmarket institution but as a hybrid-economic institution constituted by interdependent market and nonmarket dynamics.

For this reason, systemic risk assessment with partial information is potentially very useful for regulators and other stakeholders. In this paper we consider systemic risk due to fire sales spillovers and portfolio rebalancing by using the risk metrics defined by Greenwood et al. 2015). By using a method based on the constrained minimization of the Cross Entropy, we show that it is possible to assess aggregated and single bank's systemicness and vulnerability, using only the information on the size of each bank and the capitalization of each investment asset. We also compare our approach with an alternative widespread application of the Maximum Entropy principle allowing to derive graph probability distributions and generating scenarios and we use it to propose a statistical test for a change in banks' vulnerability to systemic events.

Using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS), we find that the well-being of Georgians in Russia suffered negatively from the 2008 Russo Georgian conflict. We show that the conflict has no direct effect on the labor market outcomes of Georgians, and therefore, we attribute the negative effect of conflict on well-being to more indirect channels such as fear, altruism, or sympathy. In comparison, we find no general effect of the Ukrainian Russian conflict of 2014 on the Ukrainian nationals' happiness. However, the life satisfaction of Ukrainians who reside in the southern regions of Russia in close proximity to Ukraine is negatively affected. We also show that the negative effect of conflict is short-lived with no long-term legacy. Additionally, we analyze the spillover effects of conflict on other minorities in Russia. We find that while the well-being of non-slavic and migrant minorities who have recently moved to Russia is negatively affected, there is no effect on local minorities who have been living in Russia for at least ten years.","[Gokmen, Gunes; Yakovlev, Evgeny] New Econ Sch, Novaya St 100A, Moscow, Russia; [Gokmen, Gunes] Ctr Study Divers & Social Interact, Novaya St 100A, Moscow, Russia",New Economic School,"Gokmen, G (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Novaya St 100A, Moscow, Russia.;Gokmen, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Study Divers & Social Interact, Novaya St 100A, Moscow, Russia.",gunesgokmen@gmail.com; eyakovlev@nes.ru,"Yakovlev, Evgeny Y./Q-4931-2017",,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","Gokmen acknowledges the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Grant no. 14.U04.31.0002 administered by CSDSI.",,21,1,1,0,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

The model generates two types of equilibria: a no-default equilibrium and a mixed equilibrium. In the no-default equilibrium, all banks are symmetric and always solvent, while in the mixed equilibrium, some banks can be internationally illiquid and default simultaneously. The latter equilibrium captures the basic features of banking crises after financial liberalization in emerging market economies. In this case, a large capital inflow leads to high asset price volatility and magnifies a banking crisis.

Costs of motion are represented by a Riemannian metric, i.e., a state-dependent inner product on the set of population states. The replicator dynamics and the (Euclidean) projection dynamics are the archetypal examples of the class we study. Like these representative dynamics, all Riemannian game dynamics satisfy certain basic desiderata, including positive correlation, local stability of interior ESSs, and global convergence in potential games. When the underlying Riemannian metric satisfies a Hessian integrability condition, the resulting dynamics preserve many further properties of the replicator and projection dynamics. We examine the close connections between Hessian game dynamics and reinforcement learning in normal form games, extending and elucidating a well-known link between the replicator dynamics and exponential reinforcement learning.

In this paper, we use cluster analysis to examine the convergence patterns of income inequality, absolute redistribution (a measure of governments' effectiveness in correcting for inequality) and unemployment. The expected outcome after years of economic integration was, ex-ante, convergence to a single cluster. Our results, however, uncover a variety of groups, implying that economic integration has not led to real economic convergence. Moreover, the existence of different patterns suggests: (i) that traditional classifications (Anglo-Saxon, Continental European, European Periphery, and Nordic models) remain broadly valid; (ii) that there is no unemployment-inequality trade-off to be exploited in terms of economic policy; and (iii) that the redistributive capacity of governments plays a pivotal role in coping with inequality without negative effects in terms of unemployment.","[Monfort, Mercedes; Ordonez, Javier] Inst Econ Int, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Monfort, Mercedes; Ordonez, Javier] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Sala, Hector] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain; [Sala, Hector] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Universitat Jaume I; Autonomous University of Barcelona; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Sala, H (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.;Sala, H (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",Hector.Sala@uab.cat,"Monfort, Mercedes/AAF-7083-2020; Sala, Hector/K-6370-2017; Ordonez, Javier/K-3665-2014","Sala, Hector/0000-0002-3043-2790; Ordonez, Javier/0000-0002-1453-2441; Monfort Bellido, Mercedes/0000-0002-3798-4379","Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/201/053, AICO/2016/38]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [ECO2017-83255-C3-3-P]; UJI [UJI-B2017-33]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-75623-R]","Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); UJI; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","We acknowledge constructive comments received from an anonymous referee.

Society seeks to maximize social welfare by imposing restrictions on the central bank's actions over time, and the central bank takes these restrictions and the new Keynesian Phillips curve as constraints. By solving a dynamic mechanism design problem, we find that it is optimal to grant constrained discretion to the central bank by imposing both upper and lower bounds on permissible inflation, and that these bounds should be set in a history-dependent way. The optimal degree of discretion varies over time with the severity of the time-inconsistency problem, and although no discretion is optimal when the time-inconsistency problem is very severe, it is a transient phenomenon and some discretion is granted eventually.","[Waki, Yuichiro] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dennis, Richard] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Dept Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Fujiwara, Ippei] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Fujiwara, Ippei] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Glasgow; Keio University; Australian National University,"Waki, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",y.waki@uq.edu.au; richard.dennis@glasgow.ac.uk; ippei.fujiwara@keio.jp,"Dennis, Richard/AAZ-5973-2020","Dennis, Richard/0000-0002-4972-1509; Fujiwara, Ippei/0000-0003-3078-6588; Waki, Yuichiro/0000-0003-1929-3520",JSPS KAKENHI [15H01939]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01939] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was conducted as a part of the project Social Security, Taxation, and Public Finance undertaken at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI).

In order to shed some light on this topic, this study combines data from South Africa's recent Income and Expenditure Survey with data from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa to estimate the determinants of residential energy demand. Combining electricity tariff data from the regulator with expenditure survey data from households provides an opportunity to explore the determinants of the demand for electricity. Due to the large number of zeroes in the dataset, a two-part model is employed. The results indicate that household income and electricity price are major demand determinants, and for the full two-part model, electricity demand is normal, as well as downward sloping, although inelastic in both cases; as expected, substitute fuel use impacts these elasticities. We also find that access to free basic electricity, a policy designed to improve access to electricity does what is expected. It is associated with increases in the probability that households purchase electricity and reduces total expenditure on electricity. Household demand is also higher for appliance-rich households in urban areas, especially if there are more household members and they live in larger dwellings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The result of the constructive identification suggests a multi-step procedure to estimate the model primitives. Monte Carlo results illustrate that the procedure works well in practice. We apply the methodology to the experimental data we collected and show that subjects strategically respond to provision history by making an adjustment based on their preceding contributing strategies.

The number of Uber (Lyft) rides per hour is about 22 (19)% higher when it is raining, while the number of taxi rides per hour increases by only 5% in rainy hours suggesting that surge pricing (prime time) encourages an increase in supply. We show that while the number of taxi rides, passengers and fare income all significantly decreased after Uber entered the market in May 2011, taxis do not respond differently to increased demand in rainy hours than non-rainy hours since the entrance of Uber. Last, we test whether Lyft's entry in the market affected Uber. Our estimates suggest that Uber was still growing after Lyft entered the market, but that Uber rides during rainy hours decreased by about 9%.

We show that the model's key prediction-an individual's ordinal rank predicts her behavior and test scores-is borne out in one randomized controlled trial in Kenya as well as administrative data from the United States. To test whether our selection mechanism can explain the effect of rank on outcomes, we conduct an experiment with nearly 600 public school students in Houston.

For workers without a college education these figures are 3.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. Why are earnings profiles flatter for recent cohorts? We build a parsimonious model of schooling and human capital accumulation on the job, and calibrate it to earnings statistics of workers from the 1940 cohort. The model accounts for 99% of the flattening of earnings profiles for workers with a college education between the 1940 and the 1980 cohorts (52% for workers without a college education). The flattening in our model results from a single exogenous factor: the increasing price of skills. The higher skill price induces (i) higher college enrollment for recent cohorts and thus a change in the educational composition of workers and (ii) higher human capital at the start of work life for college-educated workers in the recent cohorts, which implies lower earnings growth over the life cycle.

Our identification strategy exploits exogenous shifts in the cost of purchasing U.S. commercial weapons, through a combination of time variation in U.S. inflation and cross-sectional variation in a country's historical frequency of purchases. We find that weapons purchases reduce the likelihood of political repression but increase the likelihood of onset of civil war in purchasing countries. The results suggest that state investment in military capability incites civil war in countries where state repression of an aggrieved opposition would have otherwise prevailed.

Using social network analysis methods, this study finds a spatial correlation network between interregional capital flows. The closeness of the network is strong and has a high stability. Different provinces exhibit different positions in the network. Beijing, Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanghai, and Zhejiang are at the relative core, while Qinghai, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Anhui, and Tibet are at the periphery. According to a block model, the eastern provinces belong to a bidirectional spillover block, the middle provinces are in a primary beneficial block, and the western provinces are in a net beneficial block. Based on a quadratic assignment procedure regression analysis, the paper concludes that geographical distance and differences in provinces' fixed asset investments, foreign direct investments, and marketization levels are important factors that impact the spatial correlation of capital flows. The conclusions of this paper are significant for the formulation of a regional coordinated strategy in China.","[Qian, Xianhang] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ying] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guangli] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Shandong University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, GL (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",guanglizhang1987@126.com,"wang, ying/HGV-2225-2022; Chen, Liang/JXX-7887-2024; Qian, Xianhang/GPK-2847-2022","wang, ying/0000-0002-3801-9933; Qian, Xianhang/0000-0002-2185-0886",Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2018QG006]; Project of Humanities and Social Science from MOE of China [17YJC630166]; Program of Qilu Young Scholars of Shandong University; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province,Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Project of Humanities and Social Science from MOE of China; Program of Qilu Young Scholars of Shandong University; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2018QG006), the Project of Humanities and Social Science from MOE of China (17YJC630166), the Program of Qilu Young Scholars of Shandong University, the Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics, and the Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province.",,31,16,16,3,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

When monetary policy is constrained and cannot carry out this short run expansion, there is a potential role for fiscal policy. Although this idea has received a lot of attention in the policy debate, there has been little formal study of the fiscal consequences of reforms under constrained monetary policy. This paper uses a model to quantify the short run fiscal costs and long run fiscal benefits of reforms, in order to see to what extent the latter justify the former. The fiscal costs and benefits of reforms are both generally found to be small, although larger reforms entail larger rises in deficit-to-GDP in the short run. Results suggest that reforms in labour markets have little effect on public finances in the long run, but their short run costs can be ameliorated if combined with product market reforms.

Once we allow for course selectivity in our analysis we find that our estimates of the effects of attending the most prestigious HEIs is around 10 percentage points lower than otherwise; the effects of attending the middle ranking HEIs is around 5 percentage points lower; and that of attending these lowest ranking HEIs is unaffected.

However, with the global urban population currently generating two-thirds of all carbon emissions, global policymakers are urging mayors and regional leaders to make difficult decisions to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization on the environment. The authors begin their examination of the implications of local and regional factors by applying the Dynamic Spatial Durbin Panel Data Model to empirically examine aspects of developing low-carbon strategies for the rapidly expanding size and number of the world's urban areas. The results indicate that the contribution of urbanization to carbon emissions can be positively affected when regional policy makers collaborate to focus on spillover effects to simultaneously manage the scope, diversity, and complexity of economic and environmental issues from the perspective of creating a balance between rapid urbanization and relevant regional factors. Regional leaders can make a difference by creating both short-term goals and long-term strategies for maintaining low-carbon urbanization, nurturing regional coordination, monitoring and managing eco-friendly regional spillover effects, supporting low-carbon technology innovations, and maintaining optimal city size.","[Niu, Honglei] Xuzhou Inst Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lekse, William] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Xuzhou University of Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Niu, HL (通讯作者)，Xuzhou Inst Technol, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",niuhonglei@126.com,,,China's Ministry of Education [17YJCZH132]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education [2015SJD473]; science and technology planning project of China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development [2014-R4-015]; science and technology project of Jiangsu Provincial Construction System [2014ZD45]; 333 High-level Talent Training Project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for Prominent Young & Middle-aged University Teachers and Presidents,"China's Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; science and technology planning project of China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development; science and technology project of Jiangsu Provincial Construction System; 333 High-level Talent Training Project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Overseas Research & Training Program for Prominent Young & Middle-aged University Teachers and Presidents","We would like to thank Professor Shang for her valuable and insightful comments on this manuscript.

The relationship is stable over time, even during the 2008-9 economic crisis and across different types of establishment. We verify our results with independent measures from administrative data.

When CPs link their contents, they attract indirect visitors who first visit one CP and then the other so as to benefit from the complementarities of their products. We show that CPs are interested in reaching a linking agreement when the termination fee set by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) is not particularly high. The ISP may also find it profitable to set a low termination fee that leads CPs to reach a linking agreement. First, it benefits from the increase in the Internet traffic, provided that its cost of transmitting content is not too high. And second, the links increase the consumers' willingness to pay for the service, which allows it to set a higher subscription fee. Last, we show the cases in which the regulation of the termination fee can increase social welfare.

A dynamic structural model of employment, fertility, and child care use is estimated using Norwegian administrative data. The estimation exploits a large-scale child care reform, which provided generous cash transfers to mothers who did not use formal child care facilities. We find that the reform generates sizable changes in employment and fertility decisions, especially among low-education women. We then use the mothers' unobserved heterogeneity in the structural model as a control function to examine the effects of mothers' behavior on long-run cognitive outcomes of children. The reform leads to lower reading scores among children, primarily as a result of mothers shifting to inferior forms of care. In counterfactual simulations, we compare the effects of an alternative child care subsidy, an expanded maternity leave program, and a tax deduction for mothers with children.","[Chan, Marc K.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Liu, Kai] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Norwegian Sch Econ, Cambridge, England; [Liu, Kai] IZA, Cambridge, England",University of Melbourne; University of Cambridge,"Chan, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",marc.chan@unimelb.edu.au; kai.liu@econ.cam.ac.uk,,"Chan, Marc/0000-0002-1010-7587",,,,,60,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Studies show that electing a community member to operate a centralized sanctioning institution further increases support for the public good. These studies have overlooked an all-too-common attribute of non-laboratory elections: political inequality. In this paper, we replicate those studies and, then, introduce novel experimental treatments that examine how political inequality influences the cooperation-enhancing effect of a democratic election to centralized sanctioning institutions. In our novel treatment conditions, participants receive either a random allotment of votes that they can use to elect a centralized sanctioning authority or an allocation of votes proportional to their earnings in a previously-executed public goods game. We find that political inequalities created via the random allocation of votes do not hinder cooperation, whereas political inequalities created via past game play undermine elected authorities and diminish contributions to the public good from individuals advantaged by political inequality.","[Chang, Han Il] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Dawes, Christopher T.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Johnson, Tim] Willamette Univ, Salem, OR 97301 USA",New York University Abu Dhabi; New York University; Willamette University,"Chang, HI (通讯作者)，A5 179 New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",hanilchang0928@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,3,4,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Entry and revenue are much more responsive to tariffs than they are to real exchange rates. Our estimates translate into an elasticity of aggregate exports with respect to tariff changes of between -1.5 and -3.5 on impact, and between -2 and -5 in the long run. Comparable elasticities for real exchange rate changes are around 0.5 on impact, and between 0.6 and 0.8 in the long run. These estimates are consistent with estimates in the literature based on aggregate data.

We develop a neoclassical framework with a conflict of interest between the altruistic donor and the recipient government, and model conditionality as an imperfectly enforceable dynamic contract. In contrast to the recent practice of fully cancelling debt, optimal incentive-compatible conditionality is accompanied by a concessionality level that implies a combination of subsidized loans and outright grants. The optimal concessionality level depends on the recipient's access to international financial markets and on the strength of the conflict of interest. Incentive-compatible transfers with optimal concessionality levels generate substantial welfare gains. If the donor does not implement the optimal concessionality level and provides subsidized loans only, then the effectiveness of transfers decreases in the long run with severe welfare implications. In contrast, transfers are less effective in the short run if the donor offers outright grants only.","[Scholl, Almuth] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Scholl, A (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.",,,,junior professor programme of the state Baden-Wurttemberg,junior professor programme of the state Baden-Wurttemberg,This research was supported by the junior professor programme of the state Baden-Wurttemberg.

The present paper addresses these issues in a model of optimal tax policy to combat climate change and discusses the consequences for optimal climate policies. Furthermore, from a normative-methodological point of view, we argue that psychological adaptation needs to be taken into account even by a pure welfarist policy maker, who aims at internalizing an intertemporal externality.","[Aronsson, Thomas] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business Econ & Stat, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Schob, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Umea University; Free University of Berlin,"Schöb, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",Thomas.Aronsson@econ.umu.se; Ronnie.Schoeb@fu-berlin.de,,,Swedish Research Council [421-2010-1420],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees, David Granlund, and Daniel Nachtigall for helpful comments and suggestions.

A great deal is known about gender differentials in earnings, but how far does this carry over to total incomes? This paper investigates the gender divide at the top of the income distribution using tax record data for eight countries with individual taxation. It shows that women are strongly under-represented at the top of the distribution. Although the presence of women at the top has increased over time, the rise becomes smaller at the very top. The income gradient by gender has become more marked. The paper also shows that income composition differs by gender and exhibits significant changes over time, underlining the fact that it is not sufficient to look only at earned income.","[Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Casarico, Alessandra] Univ Bocconi, Milan, Germany; [Casarico, Alessandra] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Casarico, Alessandra] Dondena Res Ctr Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Voitchovsky, Sarah] Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Carlton, Vic, Australia; [Voitchovsky, Sarah] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ifo Institut,"Casarico, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Milan, Germany.;Casarico, A (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Casarico, A (通讯作者)，Dondena Res Ctr Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy.",alessandra.casarico@unibocconi.it; sarah.voitchovsky@unimelb.edu.au,"Voitchovsky, Sarah/O-6788-2014",,INET (Oxford); Swiss National Science Foundation,INET (Oxford); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This article has been written in co-operation with Facundo Alvaredo, Jorgen Modalsli and Jakob Sogaard who have supplied the results for Spain, Norway and Denmark, respectively.

By exploiting a large dataset on petrol stations, it is shown that the impact resulting from a standard method can be significant even from an imaginary border. This meaningless outcome is straight forwardly corrected by basing the work on a quasi-experimental design intended to disentangle the impacts of heterogeneity and border. An application to know to what extent the political boundary between Portugal and Spain affects price dispersion in terms of driving time is carried out. We found an irrelevant border effect for the intra-national regions, which contrasts with a significant although moderate impact for the international border. That is, the Portugal-Spain border is at most equivalent to an additional driving time between petrol stations of about five minutes.","[Balaguer, Jacint; Ripolles, Jordi] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Balaguer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.",jacint.balaguer@uji.es,"Ripollés, Jordi/AGL-5986-2022; Balaguer, Jacint/L-5291-2014; Ripolles, Jordi/R-6942-2018","Balaguer, Jacint/0000-0003-3798-1976; Ripolles, Jordi/0000-0002-8637-6871",Universitat Jaume I [UJI-B2017-17]; European Union FEDER funds; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-58975-P],Universitat Jaume I; European Union FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors are grateful to the participants of 5th Meeting on International Economics (Villarreal, Spain) and especially to the Professor Lutz Kilian for their comments.

Our analysis focuses on the set of banks that were bailed out by the Spanish authorities. Data from the credit register of the Bank of Spain indicate that these banks curtailed lending well in advance of their bailout. We show the existence of a credit supply shock, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity through firm fixed effects, and assess its impact on employment. To this aim, we compare the changes in employment between 2006 and 2010 at client firms of weak banks to those at comparable firms with no significant precrisis relationship to weak banks. Our estimates imply that around 24% of job losses at firms attached to weak banks in our sample are due to this exposure. This accounts for one-half of the employment losses at firms that survived and one-third of employment losses at those that closed down.","[Bentolila, Samuel] CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; [Jansen, Marcel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Jimenez, Gabriel] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Banco de Espana,"Bentolila, S (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Madrid, Spain.",bentolila@cemfi.es; marcel.jansen@uam.es; gabriel.jimenez@bde.es,"Bentolila, Samuel/D-8737-2014",,"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-37742, ECO2015-69631-P]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Bentolila is also affiliated with CEPR and CESifo, Jansen is also affiliated with Fedea and IZA.

Using techniques of complex network analysis applied to the Thomson Reuters Eikon database we introduce a definition of centralization as network control and present a first study of its global evolution from 2001 to 2016. We find that the global network control is highly centralized: the fraction of the top holders cumulatively holding the 80% of the global economic value of the companies examined does never exceed 2%. Furthermore, by inspecting the temporal dynamics of the phenomenon we observe a relevant increase in the centralization of capital: this trend assumes a more regular and general character since the financial crisis started in 2007, with a growth of more than 20%.

This study aims to explore the strategic fit of potential mergers and acquisitions in the Chinese banking industry. When the operations of two banks are jointly analyzed this means that the inputs and the outputs of these two individual banks are somehow combined in an attempt to better understand the sector as a whole. A novel SFA model with Bayesian inference on input/output prices is proposed to assess the impact of business-related variables on efficiency levels. The results not only reveal that bank size, type, and origin present a significant impact on individual technical efficiency levels, but also exert a significant impact on the efficiency frontier of the industry. The strategic fit of M&As in the Chinese banking industry strongly relies on opportunities derived from banking automation that may arise from acquiring technologically obsolete small banks. Big and foreign banks also exert a positive impact on the technological catch-up of Chinese banks, which may suggest opportunities for sector deregulation.","[Chen, Zhongfei] Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Sch Econ, Huangpu West Rd 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wanke, Peter] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Sch Business, Ctr Studies Logist Infrastruct & Management, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Chen, Zhongfei] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Lancaster University; Athens University of Economics & Business; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Chen, ZF (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, China Ctr Econ Dev & Innovat Strategy, Sch Econ, Huangpu West Rd 601, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Chen, ZF (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hongyeczf@163.com; peter@coppead.ufrj.br; m.tsionas@lancaster.ac.uk,"Chen, Zhongfei/L-2323-2019; Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020; Wanke, Peter/G-3184-2010","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Wanke, Peter/0000-0003-1395-8907","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71704065]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620022]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2016A030310083, 2017A030310003]","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","We thank the support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant No. 71704065], the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Grant No. 2017M620022] and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [Grant No. 2016A030310083, Grant No. 2017A030310003].",,50,8,8,0,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In order to do this, a temporal analysis of homicides rate during 2000-2010 is undertaken through the inclusion of temporal dynamic characteristics in a spatial autoregressive model, a spatial weights matrix was constructed that was based on the distance travelled between near-by municipalities and the departmental capital cities which were defined as centroids, which standardizes the municipal relationship that affects the demographic dynamics and social connectivity of the last decade that affects homicides and their temporal persistence. The results show that in some departments of the country there is spatial agglomeration in homicide rates in nearby municipalities but the spatial shock is low and disappears in time.

This paper proposes the prosociality of the status quo allocation as a determinant of the prosociality of intuitive decisions. I present results from two experiments (N = 1,649) that manipulate time pressure and elicit response times in a binary dictator game. One of the choices is prosocial while the other is pro-self. The status quo option is varied to be equal to the prosocial allocation in one treatment and the selfish allocation in a second treatment. In a third treatment, there is no status quo allocation. Time pressure is found to increase selfishness in treatments without a status quo and has no effect on choices in treatments with a status quo. However, the status quo systematically affects response times. Prosocial choices are made significantly faster than selfish choices under a prosocial status quo and selfish choices are made significantly faster than prosocial choices under a selfish status quo.","[Gaertner, Manja] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Competit & Consumers, Mohrenstr 58, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Gaertner, Manja] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Linkoping University,"Gärtner, M (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Competit & Consumers, Mohrenstr 58, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Gärtner, M (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",mgaertner@diw.de,,"Gartner, Manja/0000-0002-7007-9661",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Tore Browaldh Foundation [H2011-0289:1],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Tore Browaldh Foundation,"This study was largely developed while the author was at the Department of Economics, Stockholm University.

The following heuristic is studied: investors collect information on previously implemented projects with the same signal realization, and invest if the associated mean return exceeds the cost. The corresponding steady states result in suboptimal investments, due to selection bias and the heterogeneity of signals across investors. When higher signals are associated with higher returns, investors are overoptimistic, resulting in overinvestment.

Following up on a conjecture by Smith (1976a), we test whether the well-known equilibrating power of the double auction institution is robust to the presence of complete information about traders' values and costs and the presence of symmetric market power. We find that complete information is insufficient to impede convergence to CE prices; however, introducing market power consistently causes prices to deviate from the CE, whether or not subjects possess complete information. Our design highlights the value of boundary experiments in understanding how market institutions shape behavior, and our findings help delineate the limits of the double auction institution to generate competitive outcomes.

The supervision authorities play a key role in protecting banking stability by ensuring banks ' resilience to shocks, ability to recover their position in response to crisis and ultimately the supervision authorities help prevent failure of these banks. Therefore, in recent years' researchers have been trying to define conditions that could guarantee stability of banks. Purpose of the article: This paper aims to describe the methodology used to measure banking stability, namely banking stability index (BSI) and Z-score. In the first part, we present the literature review, then we try to assess the stability in the condition of the Czech Republic and Slovakia during the period 2006-2016. Methods: The BSI is constructed according to the methodology presented by Ghosh (2011), taking into account the main components, which are described by the set of financial indicators of banks. Findings & Value added: Results showed that the average BSI in the whole sample moved from 0.20454 (in 2015) to 0.2486 (in 2007). The results according to countries have showed that the tendency of development in the Czech and Slovak banking sector was the same. At the beginning of the analyzed period, the Slovak banks were more stable compared to Czech ones. Since 2009 the situation has been different, where the Czech banks could be considered as more stable compared to Slovak ones. The tendency of development of Z-score in both countries could be considered as the same, without the 2009 year, when the Czech banks significantly strengthened their capitalization, which influenced the development of Z-score. The results of correlation analysis between Z-score and BSI pointed to the fact that there was no high correlation between these two measures, therefore it is appropriate to use both methodologies for stability evaluation.","[Kocisova, Kristina; Gavurova, Beata; Behun, Marcel] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Behun, Marcel/AAZ-6591-2020; Kocisova, Kristina/AAA-5401-2020; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Behun, Marcel/0000-0001-8130-9664; Kocisova, Kristina/0000-0003-0784-441X; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X",VEGA [1/0794/18],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),Research behind this paper was supported by research project VEGA 1/0794/18.,,37,12,12,3,20,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Attention is paid to the feelings of belonging that characterize these two groups; a deep attachment to Ukraine for the first, and a vague, regional sense of identity for the second. Light is shed on the perceptions of the conflict that motivated the decision to volunteer. Whereas the pro-Ukrainian combatants share the perception of Russia as an aggressor, the pro-Russian combatants see the war in geopolitical terms as a global confrontation with the West, in which Russia was forced to intervene in Ukraine. The members of both groups tend to describe their participation as the accomplishment of a patriotic duty in a purely idealistic sense, but they disqualify however the participation of their fellow combatants, and even more that of members of the enemy group who are dehumanized and presented as being blinded by propaganda, and tend to attribute their participation to primarily economic motives.","[Mikheieva, Oksana] Univ Catholique Ukrainienne, Sociol, Lvov, Ukraine; [Mikheieva, Oksana] Univ Catholique Ukrainienne, Dept Sociol, Lvov, Ukraine",,"Mikheieva, O (通讯作者)，Univ Catholique Ukrainienne, Sociol, Lvov, Ukraine.;Mikheieva, O (通讯作者)，Univ Catholique Ukrainienne, Dept Sociol, Lvov, Ukraine.",mikheieva@ucu.edu.ua,,"Mikheieva, Oksana/0000-0002-3789-2415",,,,,22,2,2,0,6,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

We exploit the identification in international trade data of parent markets (countries) to investigate whether exporting employee spinoffs of exporting parents have an advantage in accessing their parents' markets over exporting comparison firms well positioned to learn those markets at arm's length. We find that, controlling for the greater overlap of spinoffs with their parents' export products, at entry spinoffs access 51 percent more parent markets than exporting firms in the same 4-digit industries and municipalities as the parents. This advantage shrinks monotonically with time, becoming statistically insignificant four years after entry, indicating that intrafirm learning provides spinoffs with a four-year head start over learning at arm's length. Spinoffs do not overlap more than comparison firms with parent markets that the parents did not serve at spinoff entry, providing evidence against the alternative hypothesis that product overlap inadequately controls for greater technological similarity of spinoffs to parents.

The study employs a dynamic model based on the system generalized method of moments (SGMM) and analysed a balanced panel data covering 35 countries from 1980-2008. The empirical results show that the two measures of human capital have positive effects on economic growth, although the contribution of health is relatively larger than the impact of education. This finding emphasizes the importance of both measures of human capital and aligns with the argument in the literature that neither education nor health is a perfect substitute for the other as a measure of human capital.

I demonstrate by means of a medium-scale DSGE model, which I estimate with US data, how the minimum wage impacts aggregate variables. The model framework enables me to take into account various general-equilibrium effects that the minimum wage can potentially trigger. Under the estimated stance of monetary policy, the model predicts that the minimum wage has a negligible effect on the macroeconomy. However, if the Federal Reserve conducted highly dovish monetary policy, the federal minimum wage would substantially affect the macroeconomy. A minimum-wage hike would even cause an economic expansion. The paper also examines the possibility of indexing the minimum wage to an inflation measure. It compares the indexation to price inflation with the indexation to wage inflation. By considering an alternative estimated model, I present evidence that performance standards are an important adjustment channel through which firms react to changes in the minimum wage.","[Sauer, Radek] Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Sauer, Radek] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Ifo Institut; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Sauer, R (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",SauerR@ifo.de,,,,,,,45,6,6,4,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

I use administrative data from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, Department of Labor, and Department of Health, to track unemployment and arrest outcomes for this sample between 2008 and 2014. To identify the unemployment-arrest relationship, I use industry-specific variation in unemployment trends caused by the recession in 2008-2009, along with individual fixed effects to control for time-constant individual heterogeneity. The 2SLS estimates suggest that increased unemployment has large effects on rearrests for individuals with criminal records who are now active in the labor market, with substantial heterogeneity by race and sex. The results suggest larger estimates than those typically found in literature, indicating that targeting employment programs at those on the margin could substantially reduce rearrest rates for such individuals.

This paper clarifies a mechanism through which an inefficient financial system can reduce productivity growth. Using a two-sector model, second, we examine the implications for employment and the distribution of income. Both classical and Keynesian versions of the model are considered; saving decisions are central in the classical version while firms' investment and pricing decisions take center stage in the Keynesian version. We find that, although boosting the asymptotic rate of growth, a relaxation of credit constraints may reduce the share of the formal sector, increase inequality and underemployment, and have little or no effect on the medium-run rate of growth.

We assume that one of the downstream firms owns a licensable innovation that exhibits network effects and that the other can either accept the licence from the innovator or develop a substitutable innovation. We analyse the effects of the producer-innovator's two alternative licensing strategies (i.e. fixed-fee and royalty licensing) on the members of the supply chain and the supply chain's efficiency. We find that royalty licensing is optimal with low network effects. For high network effects, the innovating firm's optimal licensing strategy depends on the market size and the potential licensee's cost of developing a substitutable innovation. We also find that royalty licensing can achieve better coordination of the supply chain than fixed-fee licensing.","[Zhang, Huaige; Wang, Xuejun] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Hong, Xianpei] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qiang (Steven)] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Wuhan University; Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Sydney,"Hong, XP (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Lu, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",xphong@mail.hzau.edu.cn; steven.lu@sydney.edu.au,,"Hong, Xianpei/0000-0003-2344-239X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71672071]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662017PY044],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),The authors sincerely thank the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive and important comments on the paper.

The results imply that F.D.I. inflows from China significantly increase the bilateral exports of the investigated countries, where F.D.I. has a greater impact on the exports of new E.U. member states than on Western Balkan countries.","[Jacimovic, D.; Rajkovic, M.] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Podgorica, Montenegro; [Mitrovic, R.

Exporters may require greater commitment from their employees, such as working particular hours to communicate with partners in different time zones or travelling at short notice, and may therefore disproportionately reward employee flexibility. If women are less flexible, or perceived as such, exporters will exhibit a higher GWG than non-exporters. This hypothesis is examined using matched employer-employee data from the Norwegian manufacturing sector for 1996-2010. The results suggest a firm's entry into exporting increases the GWG by about 3 percentage points for college educated workers. A lower overlap in business hours between the Norwegian exporter and its foreign markets and a greater need for interactions with foreign buyers are associated with a higher GWG.

Historically, the attitude of Kreisky and the Social Democrats towards Keynesian fiscal policy measures to fight unemployment during the oil crises has been held to be responsible for the successive budget deficits. Kreisky's ideological debt policy has become a narrative that has strongly influenced Austrian fiscal policy until today. While this explanation for the strong increase in public debt during the Kreisky era is widely accepted, it is not necessarily true. In this paper, we assess a different explanation: the deficits might simply have resulted from forecast errors of GDP growth in those turbulent times. We find that about one-third of the increase in the debt-over-GDP ratio is directly explained by short-run forecast errors, i.e., the difference between the approved and the realized budget, and an additional one-fifth is the lower bound of forecast error regarding the long-run growth rate.","[Brugger, Florian] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Univ Str 15-G3, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Kleinert, Joern] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Univ Str 15-F4, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Kleinert, J (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Univ Str 15-F4, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",joern.kleinert@uni-graz.at,,"Kleinert, Joern/0000-0002-1167-9245",University of Graz; OeNB's Anniversary Fund,University of Graz; OeNB's Anniversary Fund,Open access funding provided by University of Graz.

Accurate prediction of turning points can help governments and enterprises develop effective oil reserve strategies and economic decisions. Nevertheless, forecasting the turning points poses great challenges in both methodology and computational effort. Log-periodic power law (LPPL) is one state-of-the-art method to predict turning points. In this research, we propose an improved version of LPPL forecasting model by incorporating a method called multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA) to search for optimal values of parameters in the LPPL model. By doing so, the improved LPPL model provided significantly superior performance in predicting the turning points compared to prior researches. To verify the quality of the improved LPPL model, we collected the data of WTI spot price in the period starting from April 2003 to November 2016 and used the improved LPPL model to predict the three turning points in this period based on the data prior to the turning points. In addition, we compared the improved LPPL model with three LPPL models that use other approaches to search for parameters, including simulated annealing, standard genetic and particle swarm optimization. We showed that the results from our LPPL model are superior to other three search approaches. We also concluded that the fluctuation of the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) spot price in March 2017 is a false alarm of a major turning point. The improved LPPL has great potential to predict future turning points. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing expenditures result from increased electricity use for cooling; and are offset to varying degrees, depending on the region, by decreased energy consumption for heating. The analysis is conducted using a model of the global buildings sector within the GCAM integrated assessment model. The integrated assessment framework is valuable because it represents socioeconomic and energy system changes that will be important for understanding building energy expenditures in the future. Results indicate that changes in net expenditures are not uniform across the globe. Net expenditures decrease in some regions, such as Canada and Russia, where heating demands currently dominate, and increase the most in areas with less demand for space heating and greater demand for space cooling.

Such an analysis is usually precluded by the lack of detailed public data on the stock of wind turbines. We therefore present a general method to estimate incomplete turbine stock data and generate hourly yields of individual turbines based on completed turbine stock data and highly disaggregated hourly wind speed data. On this basis, we calculate hourly infeed and annual market values of up to 25,700 wind turbines in Germany from 2005 to 2015. We show the spread in market values on turbine level, quantify regional differences and discuss the effect of turbine age on market values. We show that turbines in central Germany have, on average, lower market values than turbines in the north, south or far west of Germany.

First, we document that commodity prices exhibit strong comovement with other macro variables along the business cycle of these economies; and that a common factor accounts for most of the time series dynamics of these commodity prices. Guided by these stylized facts, we embed a commodity sector into a dynamic, stochastic, multi-country business cycle model of EMEs where exogenous fluctuations in commodity prices coexist with other driving forces. Commodity prices follow a common dynamic factor structure in the model. When estimated with EMEs data, the model gives to commodity shocks, mostly in the form of perturbations to their common factor, a paramount role when accounting for aggregate dynamics: more than a third of the variance of real output across the EMEs considered is associated to commodity price shocks. The model also performs well when accounting for other business cycle facts. A further amplification mechanism is a spillover effect from commodity prices to interest rates. Yet, sometimes, positive commodity price shocks have also cushioned other negative domestic shocks, particularly during the fast recovery from the world financial crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A uniform taxation across all goods is suboptimal even when the consumption preferences are separable from labor. If the consumption utility function is strictly concave and durable stocks are adjustable without friction, durable investment should be taxed at a higher rate than the purchase of nondurable goods. With adjustment frictions, the wedge on durable investment depends on substitution effects between durable and nondurable consumption and can be positive or negative. An application suggests that housing investment should face higher tax rates than regular consumption.","[Koehne, Sebastian] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Koehne, Sebastian] Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Koehne, Sebastian] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Kiel; Ifo Institut,"Koehne, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",koehne@economics.uni-kiel.de,,"Koehne, Sebastian/0000-0002-5726-2314",Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse [2012.0315],Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation),"The article has benefited from very insightful comments by the editor and anonymous referees, Johannes Becker, Felix Bierbrauer, Pierre Boyer, Tobias Broer, Helmuth Cremer, Renato Gomes, Moritz Kuhn, Rick van der Ploeg, and Nicolas Werquin.

We exploit the variation in exposure to competition from China, following its accession to the WTO in 2001, across Mexican municipalities and estimate the effect of international competition on the individual decision to migrate. Controlling for individual and municipality features, we find that individuals living in municipalities more exposed to Chinese import competition are more likely to migrate to other municipalities within Mexico, while a negative effect is found on the decision to migrate to the US. In particular, we find that Chinese import competition reduces migrants' negative self-selection: the rising international competition lowers the likelihood of low-educated, low-income people to migrate to the US, by making them more financially constrained. We do not find any evidence that changes in demand for Mexican workers in the US drive our results.","[Majlesi, Kaveh] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Majlesi, Kaveh] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Narciso, Gaia] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Narciso, Gaia] CReAM, London, England",Lund University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Trinity College Dublin,"Narciso, G (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Coll Green, Dept Econ, Arts Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland.",kaveh.majlesi@nek.lu.se; narcisog@tcd.ie,"Narciso, Gaia/AAB-2955-2022","Narciso, Gaia/0000-0003-3532-6337",,,,,29,12,13,3,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; UNITED-STATES; OFFSHORE OIL; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY,"This study empirically assesses the performance of the petroleum industry, focusing upon independent companies, in the United States (US). For the empirical study, we use the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that has been widely used for environmental assessment and performance measurement. The conventional use of DEA requests that all observations in the data set should be positive, prohibiting an occurrence of zero and/or negative values. The requirement of non-negative value is inconsistent with the reality of US petroleum industry, because many oil firms recently experience negative shocks in financial performance. To overcome the obstacle, this study discusses the property of translation invariance under undesirable congestion (e.g., capacity limit in the transportation pipeline network) and desirable congestion (e.g., green technology innovation) based on the non-radial models. The property implies that the unified efficiency measure should be not influenced even if production factors are shifted toward the same direction by adding or subtracting a specific real number. The property makes it possible that we can evaluate the performance of firms, whose production factors contain zero and/or negative values. This study is empirically concerned with practical implications of translation invariance from energy and environmental perspectives. In addition, this study examines the proposed environmental assessment in a time horizon. For the purpose, this study uses window analysis to examine an efficiency change along with a time shift. Our empirical investigation finds the following three implications. First, under the natural disposability, the oil firms' efficiency growth rates have become less than unity, implying the industry-wide difficulty or inability to cut back their drilling and production operations. Second, all firms have been under regulatory and stakeholder pressures on air pollution. Therefore, the efficiency growth rates under managerial disposbility have not exhibited a major change during the observed annual periods. Finally, such implications are statistically reconfirmed by regression analysis that examines how the change of energy price influences unified efficiencies under natural and managerial disposability. An exception can be found in the natural disposability where energy prices influence their efficiency growths. Thus, an increase in energy prices is important in maintaining a high level of efficiency growths in the US petroleum industry.

We show that in a duopoly model with linear demand and quadratic cost functions, both a partially privatized public firm and a profit-maximizing firm offers flatter supply functions as equilibrium strategies, resulting in a larger social surplus, when the public firm focuses more on social welfare. This implies that the full nationalization is optimal if firms compete in SFE, in contrast to a Cournot case, which has been used as an approximation of the wholesale electricity markets. We also confirm that the SFE converges to the (inverse) marginal cost function when the firms' social concern is improved symmetrically in the industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There have been assessments of basic medicine quality from many countries and regions across the world but almost none in Central and South America. Over the past decade, as part of our research, we have collected over ten thousand samples of medicines from 22 cities in emerging markets, but the only one from the Latin region was Sao Paolo in Brazil. We have now rectified this gap, at least for one critical medicine, the broad spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Using original, self-collected data from ten countries in Latin America, we test whether the 687 Ciprofloxacin treatments pass the Global Pharma Health Fund e.V. Minilab (R) protocol to identify substandard or counterfeit medicines. In terms of quality, 93 percent of drugs were good quality. Within the drugs that failed the quality test, the majority were substandard rather than fake. About 26 % of the poor quality drugs were fake, with zero active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), while the rest were substandard, with less than 80 % API. In line with results from our earlier studies, we find that products that were locally registered, as well as those with SRA or WHO pre-qualification, were more likely to pass the test. A new finding in this paper is that corruption is a key predictor of poor quality drugs. Less corrupt countries had higher levels of passing drugs.","[Bate, Roger; Mathur, Aparna] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1789 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Mathur, A (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, 1789 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",amathur@aei.org,,,Legatum Institute; Reason Foundation,Legatum Institute; Reason Foundation,"The funding for data collection and testing was made by two main sources, Legatum Institute and Reason Foundation.",,39,5,5,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The regulator is able to observe the effectiveness of the provision, but faces information asymmetries with respect to the efficiency of the firm's activities. Specifically, we consider a setting where one input and the output are observable, while another input and related costs are not. Multi-dimensional information asymmetries are introduced by discrete distributions for the functional form of the marginal rate of substitution between the inputs as well as for the input costs. For this novel setting, we investigate the theoretically optimal Bayesian regulation mechanism. We find that the first-best solution cannot be obtained in case of shadow costs of public funding. The second-best solution implies separation of the most efficient type with first-best input levels, and upwards distorted (potentially bunched) observable input levels for all other types. Moreover, we compare these results to a simpler non-Bayesian approach, i.e., a single pooling contract, and hence, bridge the gap between the academic discussion and regulatory practice. In a numerical simulation, we identify certain conditions in which a single contract non-Bayesian regulation can indeed get close to the second-best solution of the Bayesian menu of contracts regulation.","[Bertsch, Joachim] Ewi Energy Res & Scenarios, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany; [Hagspiel, Simeon] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Hagspiel, Simeon] ENTSO E, Ave Cortenbergh 100, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",University of Cologne,"Bertsch, J (通讯作者)，Ewi Energy Res & Scenarios, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",joachim.bertsch@ewi.research-scenarios.de,,,German research society DFG [HO 5108/2-1],German research society DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors want to thank Felix Hoffler and Christian Tode for their helpful comments, Clara Dewes for her support, the participants of the IAEE 2014 in Rome and the Spring Meeting of Young Economists 2015 in Ghent for valuable discussions, and an anonymous referee for his detailed comments.

More specifically, we examine to what extent Kuwaiti real output in the long run is shaped by oil revenue through its impact on capital accumulation, and technological transfers through foreign output. Using the same modelling strategy we also explore the role of oil income in terms of long-run private and public sector output growth (separately). The estimates suggest that real domestic output in the long run is influenced by oil revenues and foreign output (a proxy for technological progress), and technological growth in Kuwait is on a par with the rest of the world. Furthermore, while we show that both oil revenues and foreign output drive growth in the public sector, it seems that technological progress is the main (and only) driver for private sector real growth. Finally, our results show that oil revenue and global equity market shocks have a large and significant long-run impact on Kuwait's real output and public sector GDP. In comparison, the effects of the foreign output shock is muted.","[Burney, Nadeem A.; Alawadhi, Ahmad; Al-Musallam, Marwa] Kuwait Inst Sci Res, Technoecon Div, Safat, Kuwait; [Mohaddes, Kamiar] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England; [Mohaddes, Kamiar] Univ Cambridge, Girton Coll, Cambridge, England",Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Alawadhi, A (通讯作者)，Kuwait Inst Sci Res, POB 24885, Safat 13109, Kuwait.",aawadhi@kisr.edu.kw,,,,,,,37,5,5,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

It is a perspective that takes root in the psychological egoism of the 17th century, which opens out to economic thought through the works of authors like Bernard Mandeville and Joseph Butler in the 18th century, and which has found its place in economic science with the marginalist revolution and the subsequent appearance of the Neoclassic School in the second half of the 19th century. Nonetheless, in its traditional evolutionary and neuronal version, the Game Theory has spent decades showing a completely different behavioural reality of the economic agent: one that is motivationally heterogeneous and morally compromised. Therefore, the objective of the present study is twofold: on the one hand, to show how the egoistic perspective for economy comes about, is specified and develops; on the other hand, elucidate the behavioural perspective that underlies the latest neuroeconomic studies.","[Calvo, Patrici] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Castellon, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Calvo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Castellon, Spain.",calvop@uji.es,"Calvo, Patrici/AAA-9160-2019","Calvo, Patrici/0000-0002-3228-9019",,,,,83,2,2,1,14,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The main assumption of the model is that young agents can finance their education and become skilled workers by borrowing against their future income on an imperfect credit market. I show that whenever the rate of unbiased technological progress is sufficiently high there is no steady-state inequality, independent of the degree of skill bias. If instead the rate of unbiased technological progress is low, then the long-run skill premium increases with the technological skill bias. Therefore, similarly to the short run, in the long run higher technological skill bias may cause higher inequality. However, contrary to the short run, in the long run unbiased technological progress is more important than technological skill bias in determining inequality. I also discuss how the efficiency of the educational technology and the degree of financial development affect long-run inequality.","[Canidio, Andrea] INSEAD, Econ & Polit Sci Area, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France",INSEAD Business School,"Canidio, A (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Econ & Polit Sci Area, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France.",andrea.canidio@insead.edu,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

When the choice data are binary, a canonical method for making these types of predictions is the logistic choice model. This paper investigates whether it is possible to improve out-of-sample predictions by changing two aspects of the canonical approach: 1) Using response times in addition to the choice data, and 2) Combining them using a model from the psychology and neuroscience literature, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM). Two experiments compare the out-of-sample choice prediction accuracies of both methods and in both cases the DDM method outperforms a logistic prediction method. Furthermore, the DDM allows for out-of-sample process predictions. Both experiments validate the DDM as a method for predicting out-of-sample response times. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the life-cycle of parental cognitive abilities on offspring's cognitive abilities within the British National Child Development Study (NCDS). We find that children benefit not only from the stock of cognitive abilities their mothers and fathers hold as adolescents, but also from cognitive evolution their parents achieve as adults. Furthermore, we find that favourable parental cognitive ageing is particularly important for low ability offspring, pointing to a potential role of cognition in delivering more effective mitigation and nurturing. When analysing three subsequent generations, we find that the transmission of late parental cognition is strong in the offspring with high education origins, in particular for the those in the upper tail of the cognitive abilities distribution. We quantify the economic impact of the cognitive ageing transmission, and find that one standard deviation increase in late parental cognition can be approximated to an average of 1.7% increase in offspring earnings.

We suggest that the explanation may lie in the industry choice of microfinance participants: if borrowers tend to enter imperfectly competitive sectors, such as retail, there may be a business-stealing effect that reduces incomes of existing businesses. Our model shows that microfinance may lower total incomes at the village level. The result is related to the classic Mankiw and Whinston (1986) result on excess entry. The results imply that microfinance organizations may want to steer recipients away from the petty retail sector in some markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of 39 African former European colonies for 2006-11, this paper investigates the extent to which the historical institutional determinants identified by legal origins, disease endowment, religion-based and ethnic fractionalisation theories explain current differences in financial system development across Africa. While most existing research focuses only on one financial system development dimension, namely financial system depth, this article considers also financial system access. The results do not support any of the above theories when depth measures are used, while three of them (legal origins, disease endowment and ethnic fractionalisation theories) are validated when using access measures. This suggests that in Africa financial system depth and access do not have common historical institutional determinants, pointing to the need for greater fine tuning of prevalent theories and empirical measures.","[Emenalo, Chukwunonye O.] Pan Atlantic Univ, Lagos Business Sch, Lagos, Nigeria; [Gagliardi, Francesca; Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Emenalo, CO (通讯作者)，Pan Atlantic Univ, Lagos Business Sch, Lagos, Nigeria.",cemenalo@lbs.edu.ng; f.gagliardi@herts.ac.uk; g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Gagliardi, Francesca/KCK-6190-2024; Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021","Gagliardi, Francesca/0000-0003-3240-2760",,,,,68,16,16,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Evidence from the gravity model estimates reveals that the two donors' exports are strengthened by their aids to African partners. Interestingly, China's aid shows a positive effect on its total volume of trade and imports from Africa, while the aid from the US exhibits little impact on the US-Africa total trade and its imports from Africa. A possible explanation for such a difference could be due to the dissimilar national interests of donors in Africa.

The declining impact of colonial legacies on African institutional and economic development,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DETERMINANTS; GROWTH,"This paper investigates the claim that colonial history has left an enduring imprint on Africa's institutional and economic development. The literature following Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) and Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) maintains that different types of colonialism affected the institutional environment differently, and that path-dependence subsequently ensures that these institutional differences and their impact on economic performance are persistent over time. By tracing the impact of colonial institutions on contemporary institutions over time, I show that - in contrast to claims in this literature - the relevance of colonial legacies to institutional quality and to per capita income is rapidly disappearing in Africa. Differences in institutional quality or income are explained less and less by colonial legacy, while there is some evidence that precolonial social and geographical circumstances are becoming more important. I conclude that while colonialism has affected African institutional and economic development significantly, this impact is not persistent. Rather, the evidence suggests that colonialism has created a large but very temporary institutional shock, after which a long-run equilibrium is being restored.","[Maseland, Robbert] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Maseland, Robbert] Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic, Australia",University of Groningen,"Maseland, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.;Maseland, R (通讯作者)，Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic, Australia.",r.k.j.maseland@rug.nl,,,,,,,52,24,26,1,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We test whether there is enough evidence in favor of the polarization hypothesis on the Colombia labor market. Methods: We use occupations descriptions to build technology-use related tasks intensities, and match them to series of cross sections of household survey data in order to evaluate to what extent the reallocation of workers across occupations that require different tasks intensities are consistent with the Polarization hypothesis. Results: We find an increase of employments at the extremes of the wage or skill occupations distribution, particularly pronounced in the period when the availability of technologies increased, and their prices substantially dropped.

First, to undertake a retrospective view of Mis-Specification (M-S) testing, going back to the early 20th century, with a view to (i) place it in the broader context of modeling and inference and (ii) bring out some of its special features. Second, to call into question several widely used arguments undermining the importance of M-S testing in favor of relying on weak probabilistic assumptions in conjunction with generic robustness claims and asymptotic inference. Third, to bring out the crucial role of M-S testing in securing trustworthy inference results. This is achieved by extending/modifying Fisher's statistical framework with a view to draw a clear line between the modeling and the inference facets of statistical induction. The proposed framework untangles the statistical from the substantive (structural) model and focuses on how to secure the adequacy of the statistical model before probing for substantive adequacy. A case is made for using joint M-S tests based on custom-built auxiliary regressions with a view to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of probing for potential statistical misspecifications.","[Spanos, Aris] Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Spanos, A (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",aris@vt.edu,"Spanos, Aris/P-8464-2019",,,,,,82,22,23,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Our results confirm the existence of a persistent core cluster as opposed to clusters on the Eastern and Southern European peripheries, highlighting the inadequate composition of the euro area (EA). Moreover, we find that Germany's business cycle is not a suitable substitute for the core.

To address this question, we develop an analytical framework featuring how expected capital gains impact households' housing investment decisions when subject to financial constraints. Housing demand in China takes place not only through households' owning multiple houses, but also through their owning a larger primary living residence if they are constrained from buying multiple houses. We show that households are more likely to own multiple houses when expecting higher capital gains. As expected capital gain increases, the primary housing demand of those households who are constrained from owning multiple houses increases, while those owing multiple housing units invest in extra ones instead of improving primary housing. Our empirical findings, based on 2010 and 2011 household survey data, are consistent with our theoretical predictions. We also find that the marginal effect of expected capital gains is higher for wealthier households. This links the booming housing market to widening income inequality which is a typical growth pain in a developing country like China. As an extension, we apply the analysis to derive implications of the institutional features (such as purchasing restriction policy and the existence of subsidized housing) for China's housing markets.

Higher openness allows for greater diversification opportunities, but provides lesser immunity from outside shocks. Here I consider trade network as a composite of all pairwise trade linkages to emphasize that different linkages contribute differently to the transmission or mitigation of shocks, and show that volatility is inversely related to centrality, a summary measure of strength of the linkages specific to a country. I study a dynamic multi-country, multi-sector model subject to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks, and characterize volatility as an explicit function of centrality, diversification and the Herfindahl of the trade network in equilibrium. With sufficient skewness in the trade linkages across countries, similar shocks generate substantially different levels of repercussions across the network. The conventional effect of diversification holds true that countries with better diversified trade portfolio fluctuate less. Centrality directly contributes to higher resilience to exogenous shocks, thus reducing volatility. Combined effect of these two mechanisms dominates the opposite effect that a more central country is also more exposed to shocks, which increases volatility. The model calibrated to the EU generates and closely replicates the negative relationship between centrality and volatility. The theoretical model is then extended to capture preference shocks and sparseness of the trade networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For this analysis we created a two-wave panel spanning 10 years to study exit, growth and decline, by re-surveying 1000 firms randomly selected from the 2003 National Industrial Census. We find strong differences in exit patterns by region and firm size. Former owners and managers commonly cite personal circumstances as the reason for exit in the case of small firms and increasing costs in the case of large firms. We show that both growth and selection played only a small role in the evolution of the firm size distribution, contradicting earlier work on Ghana. Overall, the picture we paint of manufacturing in Ghana is not a positive one: total employment by firms operating before 2003 decreased from 134,863 in 2003 to 74,319 in 2013, although we cannot explore to what extent new employment in firms that entered after 2003-who were not surveyed-compensated for this decline.","[Davies, Elwyn] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Kerr, Andrew] Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Oxford; University of Cape Town,"Kerr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",andrew.kerr@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Here, we allow a brand to choose between vertical integration and outsourcing. With outsourcing, the brand avoids some liability and responsibility, but loses direct control over the producer's infringement of law or code of conduct. Infringement increases with production, so the brand tailors production to guide the producer's infringement. The elasticity of demand for the product affects the degree to which, under outsourcing, the brand will increase production to induce the producer to reduce cost through infringement. If the demand is sufficiently elastic relative to the social harm caused by infringement, the optimal policy is to reduce avoidance such that the brand chooses vertical integration. However, if the demand is sufficiently inelastic relative to the social harm, then the optimal policy is to increase avoidance such that the brand chooses outsourcing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Corruption in courts affects the incentives to bring forth private antitrust lawsuits. This, in turn, along with corruption in antitrust agency enforcement, alters the incentives to commit antitrust violations. The social welfare effect of enabling private antitrust enforcement in the presence of corruption depends on whether corrupt officials in the ensuing bribery contests favor a particular firm and if so which one and to what extent. Under some circumstances, corruption actually increases the social desirability of private antitrust enforcement relative to the no-corruption scenario. Our analysis highlights that the effects of a given legal arrangement for antitrust enforcement critically depend on the corruption environment and, thus, that the appropriate design of antitrust institutions is context-specific.

It was perhaps less the coercive nature of the Eastern German State that was attractive to Western companies, than an effectively centralised health care system.

At the Bank of England, the previous generation of policy models is seen in its 1999 medium-term macro model (MTMM). Instead of improving that model to correct its considerable flaws, many shared by other non-DSGE policy models such as the Federal Reserve's FRB/US, it was replaced in 2004 by the DSGE-based BEQM. Though this clearly failed during and after the global financial crisis, it was replaced in 2011 by the DSGE COMPASS, complemented by a 'suite of models'. We provide a general critique of DSGE models for explaining, forecasting and policy analyses at central banks, and suggest new directions for improving current empirical macroeconomic models based on empirical modelling broadly consistent with better theory, rather than seeking to impose simplistic and unrealistic theory.","[Hendry, David F.] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Hendry, David F.; Muellbauer, John N.

They may choose to condition social service on an observable characteristic that is correlated with types but that can be manipulated by low type individuals at a cost. We show that whether conditionality enhances social welfare depends on this cost. If the cost is too low, high type individuals refrain from requesting the service because of the resulting identity cost, bringing about a so-called non-take-up equilibrium.

The probability of a riot increases if a Hindu festival falls on a Friday, the holy day for Muslims. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of riots on electoral results. The results are also corrected for under-reporting of riots and their effect on nearby districts. We find that riots occurring in the year preceding an election increase the vote share of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party by at least 5 percentage points.","[Iyer, Sriya] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Iyer, Sriya] Univ Cambridge, St Catharines Coll, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Shrivastava, Anand] Azim Premji Univ, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Iyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.;Iyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, St Catharines Coll, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",si105@cam.ac.uk; anand.shrivastava@apu.edu.in,,,"Spiritual Capital Research Program - Metanexus Institute on Religion and Science; John Templeton Foundation; Gates Cambridge Trust; Centre for Research in Microeconomics; Faculty of Economics, Cambridge","Spiritual Capital Research Program - Metanexus Institute on Religion and Science; John Templeton Foundation; Gates Cambridge Trust; Centre for Research in Microeconomics; Faculty of Economics, Cambridge","This work has been funded by the Spiritual Capital Research Program, sponsored by the Metanexus Institute on Religion and Science, with the generous support of the John Templeton Foundation.

In this paper we analyze the problem of parametric inference from combined individual-level data when data combination is based on personal and demographic identifiers such as name, age, or address. Our main question is the identification of the econometric model based on the combined data when the data do not contain exact individual identifiers and no parametric assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of information that is common across the combined data set. We demonstrate the conditions on the observable marginal distributions of data in individual data sets that can and cannot guarantee identification of the parameters of interest. We also note that the data combination procedure is essential in a semiparametric setting such as ours. Provided that the (nonparametric) data combination procedure can only be defined in finite samples, we introduce a new notion of identification based on the concept of limits of statistical experiments. Our results apply to the setting where the individual data used for inferences are sensitive and their combination may lead to a substantial increase in the data sensitivity or lead to a de-anonymization of the previously anonymized information. We demonstrate that the point identification of an econometric model from combined data is incompatible with restrictions on the risk of individual disclosure. If the data combination procedure guarantees a bound on the risk of individual disclosure, then the information available from the combined data set allows one to identify the parameter of interest only partially, and the size of the identification region is inversely related to the upper bound guarantee for the disclosure risk. This result is new in the context of data combination as we notice that the quality of links that need to be used in the combined data to assure point identification may be much higher than the average link quality in the entire data set, and thus point inference requires the use of the most sensitive subset of the data. Our results provide important insights into the ongoing discourse on the empirical analysis of merged administrative records as well as discussions on the disclosive nature of policies implemented by the data-driven companies (such as internet services companies and medical companies using individual patient records for policy decisions).","[Komarova, Tatiana] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London, England; [Nekipelov, Denis] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Yakovlev, Evgeny] New Econ Sch, Moscow, Russia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Virginia; New Economic School,"Komarova, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, London, England.",t.komarova@lse.ac.uk; denis@virginia.edu; eyakovlev@nes.ru,"Yakovlev, Evgeny Y./Q-4931-2017; Kolisnyk, Mykyta/HTT-4095-2023","Komarova, Tatiana/0000-0002-6581-5097",NSF; STICERD,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); STICERD,"Support from the NSF and STICERD is gratefully acknowledged.

This paper studies the circumstances under which acceptance to change occurs. We propose that reciprocity towards the employer helps to increase change approval. Subjects in our experiment play a combination of a gift exchange and a threshold contribution game. In each group, one employer chooses a wage and then five employees decide on their effort. A 'reform' is adopted if the employees exert at least a minimum threshold of effort. The reform is efficiency enhancing but also raises inequality among employees. We find that uncertainty over payoffs does not necessarily lead to resistance. The likelihood of reform approval is especially high if the employer is able to trigger reciprocal behavior in employees by offering a fair wage, which confirms our hypothesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The former relationship depends on the impartiality of the law. Where the law is markedly biased in favour of certain groups, these groups will pay a surcharge for capital. Legal power, as measured by privileges before the law, thus undermines financial power, the capacity to borrow cheaply.

Understanding the price signals and interactions of these two newly created markets is essential for all decision makers - regulators and direct market participants - who aim to reach the predefined policy goals in the most efficient manner. The interaction between these policy instruments has been widely examined from the theoretical perspective. This research contributes to the literature by empirically examining the interplay between the prices of three markets: (1) the price of tradable green certificates (TGC) in the Swedish-Norwegian TGC system, (2) the price of carbon in the EU ETS and (3) the price of electricity in the Nord Pool. We use a multivariate vector-autoregressive (VAR) approach to take into account the endogenous relationships between these prices. Our empirical results do not support the theoretical considerations that the impacts of carbon prices on TGC prices and hence on renewable electricity production are negative. Contrary, we find that, to date, increases in carbon prices positively affect TGC prices in the short run. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a theoretical model that provides a number of behavioural implications when (i) all regulators' dislike having their decisions overturned by courts, (ii) inexperienced regulators care more about not having their decisions overturned than experienced regulators, and (iii) experienced regulators also care about consumer surplus. The theoretical implications are tested using a database of Swedish regulatory decisions from the electricity distribution sector. We provide empirical evidence that inexperienced regulators are more likely to set higher regulated prices than experienced regulators, and as the complexity of the case increases, there are on average more overturned decisions and higher prices for inexperienced regulators. The links between experience, complexity and regulatory outcomes are both statistically and economically significant. Simulations show that if those decisions that were not appealed had been appealed, then the court would have lowered the prices by 10% on average. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we elaborate on the relationship between China's target responsibility system and CO2 emissions using interprovincial panel data, grouping provinces into Eastern, Central and Western regions to compare China's CO2 emissions convergence between the periods of the 10th Five-year Plan and the 11th Five-year Plan. The analysis indicates that the target responsibility system does not noticeably change local officials' political incentives to engage in carbon abatement because the effect of the target responsibility system for energy conservation seems to be overshadowed by and subject to gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets. Against the backdrop of growing international pressure on climate change issues, this paper argues that China must include in the target responsibility system an indicator of absolute CO2 emissions reduction as a policy objective.","[Sun Youngping] Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Hubei University of Economics,"Sun, YP (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ Econ, Ctr Hubei Cooperat Innovat Emiss Trading Syst, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",sunyp@hbue.edu.cn,"Sun, Yongping/HLX-8943-2023","Sun, Yongping/0000-0002-9425-425X",Center of Hubei Cooperative Innovation for Emissions Trading System [14YTD002]; Hubei Province's Sci-Tech Support Plan for Soft Science [2015BDF061]; Hubei Provincial Department of Education [15Q155]; China prosperity Strategic Programme Fund (SPF),Center of Hubei Cooperative Innovation for Emissions Trading System; Hubei Province's Sci-Tech Support Plan for Soft Science; Hubei Provincial Department of Education; China prosperity Strategic Programme Fund (SPF),"The author is grateful to the Economic Research Center of Graduate School of Economics, Nagoya University for inviting me to conduct the research during April 1-September 30, 2014.

We create a stock of green patents for each industrial sector and estimate a translog cost function to measure the impact of green innovation on energy intensity, next to other factors such as input substitution and autonomous technical change. We find that green innovation has contributed to the decline in energy intensity in the majority of sectors: the median elasticity of energy intensity with respect to green patenting is estimated at -0.03 in our sample. Hence, a 1% increase in green patenting activities in a given sector is associated with a 0.03% decline in energy intensity. The magnitude of the effect is robust across various specifications and is larger in more recent years. A decomposition exercise shows that, overall, half of the decrease in energy intensity over the sample period is related to changes in input prices and half to changes in production technologies.

We derive a robust dynamic derivative strategy and show that the optimal strategy under ambiguity aversion reduces the exposures to market return risk and volatility risk and that the investor holds opposite positions for the two risk exposures. In the presence of a derivative, ambiguity has distinct effects on the optimal investment strategy. More important, we demonstrate the utility improvement when considering ambiguity and exploiting derivatives and show that ambiguity aversion and derivative trading significantly improve utility when return volatility increases.

Currently, there is no consensus on whether monetary policy is, in general, able to support the resilience of the financial system or if this task should better he left to the macroprudential approach of financial regulation. The author aims to shed light on this issue by analyzing distinct policy regimes within an agent-based computational macro-model with endogenous money. lie finds that policies that make use of their comparative advantage lead to superior outcomes concerning their respective intended objectives. In particular, he shows that 'leaning against the wind' should only serve as first line of defense in the absence of a prudential regulatory regime and that price stability does not necessarily mean financial stability. Moreover, macroprudential regulation as unburdened policy instrument is able to dampen the build-up of financial imbalances by restricting credit to the unsustainable high-leveraged part of the real economy.","[Krug, Sebastian] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Krug, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.",s.krug@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Krug, Sebastian/ABE-2890-2020","Krug, Sebastian/0000-0003-1672-7995",,,,,116,3,3,0,14,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 7,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,20187.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-7,0.0,,,70,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FW9PH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000425667200001,0

This paper presents an early assessment of the domestic and global implications of NIRP by analysing the behaviour of a set of key financial variables. We report three main results. First, since the introduction of NIRP, many of the key financial variables have evolved broadly, as implied by the standard transmission channels. For the euro area, the responses of these financial variables following NIRP announcements are directionally consistent with those of conventional interest rate cuts. Second, NIRP could pose risks to financial stability but there is no conclusive evidence as yet of a significant impact on bank profitability or of a broad-based increase in leverage. Third, the responses of assets of emerging market and developing economies to NIRP announcements are on average broadly consistent with those to other types of expansionary monetary policy measures.","[Arteta, Carlos; Kose, M.

With exogenous growth, this occurs with a strong substitutability between capital and money. Otherwise, diminishing returns to capital have to be stronger than in a nonmonetary setting if capital and money are complements. With endogenous growth, saddle-path stability ensues when the rate of time preferencethe rate at which impatience is increasingexceeds the rate at which the real economy is growing along a balanced growth path.

The syndication process, therefore, generates an additional dimension of agency problem between the lead arranger and the participant lenders, in addition to the traditional agency cost of debt between the borrower and the lender (Diamond, 1984; Holmstrom and Tirole, 1997). We investigate the association between CEO entrenchment of the borrowing firm and the loan syndication concentration and composition. Several results are obtained. First, in syndicated loans made to firms with entrenched CEOs, the number of participant lenders and their share in the loan are smaller; the lead arranger retains a larger loan share. Second, these loans are held more closely (in a more concentrated manner). Third, foreign lenders are less involved in these loans; the number of foreign lenders and their shares in the loan are both smaller. Fourth, we find that the results are mainly driven by loans syndicated by non-dominant lead arrangers. Our findings shed light on the two types of agency problems associated with syndicated loans; between lenders and the borrowers and between lead arranger and participant lenders, and have important implications for shareholders, creditors and regulators.

Results show that a switch from a piece rate to a fixed rate payment scheme reduces effort provision in a real effort task while switching in the other direction increases effort provision. When the piece rate is replaced with fixed payment, men and participants with lower 2D:4D show a greater decrease in effort than the rest. We do not observe any impact of gender or 2D:4D on effort adjustment behavior when fixed payment is replaced with a piece rate.

Our empirical findings support the view that the contractionary effect of US monetary normalization on global dollar liquidity would be offset by an expansionary effect from continued supply of US dollar loans by euro area and Japanese banks. The net effect, however, is crucially dependent on the stability of global foreign exchange markets and investor perceptions of the default risks of global banks.

The fast appreciation may appear to be a classic case of the Balassa-Samuelson effect. China during this period was on a path of manufacturing-led rapid growth and technological catch-up. As expected, there was a large difference in total factor productivity growth between the tradable and nontradable sectors, which contributed to real exchange rate appreciation. However, a decomposition of the annual 4.6% real exchange rate appreciation reveals that the magnitude of the Balassa-Samuelson effect was relatively small at 1.2 percentage points. The more important factor was real appreciation in the price of tradables (a rise in the price of China's tradables relative to U.S. tradables) at 4.4 percentage points. This pattern-a modest Balassa-Samuelson effect and a large real appreciation in the price of tradables was also present in Japan and Central and Eastern European transition economies, all of which experienced long-term real exchange rate appreciation during their high growth periods. China's recent case adds to evidence that the magnitude of the Balassa-Samuelson effect is usually modest and does not account for the bulk of observed rapid real exchange rate appreciation in high growth economies.

In contrast to formal loans (e.g., from banks), informal loans (e.g., from friends or relatives) can be enforced by the threat of severing social ties. If the underlying social capital is sufficiently large, we show that informal loans carry lower interest rate and collateral than formal loans, including the possibility of zero interest and collateral. This makes informal credit a priori more attractive to borrowers. At the same time, since physical collateral is divisible unlike the social capital pledged in informal credit, default on formal loans is less costly to both parties than default on informal loans. Because of this trade-off, formal and informal credit can co-exist depending on the loan riskiness measured by the ratio of loan size to borrower's wealth (LTW ratio). Borrowers choose formal credit for riskier (larger) loans while informal credit is preferred for (smaller) projects with low default risk. Empirical results using household data from rural Thailand are consistent with the predicted choice pattern and terms of formal and informal credit. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the Chinese government raised the domestic gas price in contrast to the slump in global gas price in 2009, which accelerated the huge decrease in the natural gas subsidy scale. But the stagnation in price adjustment immediately led to a rebound in natural gas subsidy during 2010-2012. However, the level of natural gas subsidy has declined substantially in the industrial and commercial sectors since the natural gas pricing mechanism reform began in 2013. But the level of residential natural gas subsidy still remained high because the city gate pricing mechanism was not extended to this sector. The pricing mechanism was the most important decomposition factor of changes in the level of natural gas subsidy. The contribution rates of competitive gas price, pricing mechanism, consumption structure and natural gas consumption on decrease in natural gas subsidy scale were 11.08%, 101.21%, 3.15% and 9.14% respectively during 2013-2015. A reasonable and well-implemented pricing mechanism can prevent a rebound in natural gas subsidy.

Trade openness boosts prospective entrants' profits in that industry, which leads to further increases in product innovation. Trade liberalization generates a different relative impact on innovation across industries, depending on trade costs. When they are high (low), it increases process innovation relatively more in the comparative advantage (disadvantage) industry, leading to TFP divergence (convergence) across industries.","[Navas, Antonio] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Navas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",a.navas@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Navas, Antonio/0000-0003-4164-7292",,,,,33,0,0,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The secondary motivation indicates the motivation that becomes relevant when the primary motivation implies indifference between various choices. For girls, particularly older ones, maximin-preferences are the most frequent primary motivation, while for boys efficiency concerns are most relevant. Examining secondary motivations reveals that girls are mostly social-welfare-oriented, with strong equity concerns.

In this paper, we analyze if there is evidence of this type of upgrading in China's export processing regime by investigating dynamics in the relative prevalence of Import & Assembly (IA) versus Pure Assembly (PA) processing trade over the period 2000-2013. Firms in both regimes provide similar manufacturing services to foreign companies, but IA firms also conduct the sophisticated tasks of quality control, searching, financing and storing imported materials. Consistent with a trend of functional upgrading, we show that the share of IA trade in total processing trade has increased rapidly during the period 2000-2006, both overall and within product categories. Furthermore, we find that this trend has gone hand in hand with improvements in a sector's labor productivity and unit values. Against expectations, we find that this process has slowed down notably during the period 2006-2013.","[Van Assche, An] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Van Assche, An] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] CEPR, London, England",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; KU Leuven; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Van Assche, A (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ari.van-assche@hec.ca,"Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/GLV-0353-2022; Van Assche, Ari/Z-1988-2019","Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/0000-0003-4144-5578; Van Assche, Ari/0000-0003-2895-6736",World Bank project China's industrial upgrading in the context of global value chains,World Bank project China's industrial upgrading in the context of global value chains,"This research was supported by the World Bank project China's industrial upgrading in the context of global value chains.

Tourists have become aware and started considering new and far from ordinary tourist issues, like environmental protection, waste treatment measures, energy efficiency, renewable energy, green-house gas emissions, etc. The aims of the study are three-fold: (i) to assess the application of energy efficiency practices in the hotel industry; (ii) to explore the determinants of energy consumption; and (iii) to pose valuable recommendations for boosting development of eco-friendly hotels. The research was conducted in Macedonia for the purpose of identifying the impacts of several factors of managing environmental protection practices, in the first line by measuring their current level of influence. The data were obtained by an online survey conducted among managers of three-, four- and five-star hotels and processed by descriptive statistics. The results showed that managers have high positive perceptions on environmental protection issues and pose high awareness of the benefits produced by this concept, thus supporting the European environmental impact assessment regulation. The study recommends new approaches in challenging the hotel industry to decrease the operating costs and suggests that managers are in need for better understanding of the importance of energy efficiency.","[Cingoski, Vlatko] Goce Delcev Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Stip, North Macedonia; [Petrevska, Biljana] Goce Delcev Univ, Fac Tourism & Business Logist, Stip, North Macedonia",Goce Delcev University of Stip; Goce Delcev University of Stip,"Petrevska, B (通讯作者)，Goce Delcev Univ, Fac Tourism & Business Logist, Stip, North Macedonia.",biljana.petrevska@ugd.edu.mk,"Cingoski, Vlatko Tomislav/I-3190-2013; Petrevska, Biljana/R-8438-2019","Cingoski, Vlatko Tomislav/0000-0001-6097-485X; Petrevska, Biljana/0000-0002-1238-4158",,,,,71,34,35,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

These countries are particularly interesting to study because of their dissimilar generation mix. Estonia's generation mix is based on oil shale, while Sweden's is based on nuclear plants and hydroelectricity. In short, both countries' energy mixes are based on endogenous natural resources. The ARDL model was applied, allowing the long-run and short-run effects to be captured. The results prove that economic growth is sustained by natural endogenous resources. Estonia should continue to improve the usage of renewable energies, using fossil sources in support, in order to reduce emissions and to meet international environmental commitments.

We conduct an experiment using two institutions: Nash demand game (NDG) and unstructured bargaining game (UBG). Unlike most previous experiments, disagreement payoffs are earned rather than assigned, and about one-fourth of the time, one bargainer's disagreement payoff is more than half the cake size (dominant bargaining power), so that equal splits are not individually rational. Subjects under-respond to their bargaining position most severely in the NDG without dominant bargaining power. Responsiveness increases in the UBG, but is still lower than predicted; the same is true for the NDG with dominant bargaining power. Only in the UBG with dominant bargaining power - the combination of a bargaining institution with low strategic uncertainty and elimination of the 50-50 security blanket - do subjects approximately fully exploit their bargaining position.

We model the household's behaviour through a multivariate approach to allow for multiple choices at the same time. Results indicate that mobile phone and livestock ownership were identified as two key factors which increase the probability of borrowers using microfinance credit for productive purposes. Furthermore, borrowers in the rural Naryn region, one of the poorest areas in Kyrgyzstan, have a higher probability of allocating their loans toward food purchases and the smallest probability of allocating credit toward starting a business or other productive purposes.","[Angioloni, Simone] Agri Food Biosci Inst, Food Econ Div, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Kudabaev, Zarylbek] Amer Univ Cent Asia, Dept Econ, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Ames, Glenn C.

Our results can be summarized as follows: i) the eurozone sovereign bond markets under consideration have a significant and positive dependence with the Greek and the EMU benchmark sovereign bond markets; ii) the dynamic-BB7 copula function best describes the dependence structure between these sovereign bond markets and provides evidence of asymmetric tail dependence; iii) the conditional probability of crisis transmission from Greece to other eurozone countries is higher than the other way around; and iv) Greece is the most vulnerable country when the eurozone entered into the sovereign debt crisis.","[Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] AUEB, Athens, Greece; [Bekiros, Stelios; Duc Khuong Nguyen] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Jammazi, Rania] Univ Sousse, Sousse, Tunisia; [Duc Khuong Nguyen] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",European University Institute; Athens University of Economics & Business; IPAG Business School; Drexel University; Montpellier Business School; Universite de Sousse; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Nguyen, DK (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",duc.nguyen@ipag.fr,"Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020; Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787; Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726",,,,,46,8,9,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper provides new evidence of the effect of democracy on defense burden based on a Spatial Durbin Model with panel data for 98 countries for the years 1992-2008. While democracy measured by means of an index variable covering the entire range from perfect democracy to perfect autocracy turns out to be insignificant, dummy variables indicating transition to higher levels of democracy reveal a statistically highly significant negative effect of democracy on a country's defense burden. Allowing for country-specific effects reveals heterogeneity in the effect of democracy across countries. Apart from the effect of democracy, the estimation results indicate strong spatial dependence of military burdens across countries. Moreover, they provide statistical evidence for a peace dividend, for substitution effects in defense spending and for a negative effect on the military burden for countries when they exhibit a trade surplus instead of a trade deficit.","[Blum, Johannes] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Blum, J (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany.",johannes.blum@truschenhof.de,,,,,,,30,8,8,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Spells of involuntary part-time work are different from unemployment spells: a full-time worker who takes on a part-time job suffers an earnings loss while remaining employed, and is unlikely to receive income compensation from publicly provided insurance programmes. We analyse these differences through the lens of an incomplete-market, job-search model featuring unemployment risk alongside an additional risk of involuntary part-time employment. A calibration of the model consistent with US institutions and labour market dynamics shows that involuntary part-time work generates lower welfare losses relative to unemployment. This finding relies critically on the much higher probability to return to full-time employment from part-time work. We interpret it as a premium in access to full-time work faced by involuntary part-time workers, and use our model to tabulate its value in consumption-equivalent units.","[Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel; Lale, Etienne] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lale, Etienne] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd Complex,Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England",Copenhagen Business School; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bristol,"Borowczyk-Martins, D (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Borowczyk-Martins, D (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",danielbm@gmail.com; etienne.lale@bristol.ac.uk,"Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel/N-5218-2019","Borowczyk-Martins, Daniel/0000-0001-7030-5801",,,,,23,5,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

They assessed competitive balance in the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. This methodology was extended to measuring competitive balance utilizing money lines in major league baseball. This study starts by applying the same model to the money lines for the 2005-2015 seasons to measure competitive balance in the National Hockey League. It then statistically adjusts the money lines under various scenarios to estimate the effects of overtime rules and shootouts on competitive balance. Similar analyses of overtime effects on competitive balance of other sports are also completed for comparison purposes. The results indicate that competitive balance in the National Hockey League increased rather substantially during this period and that overtime rules and shootouts have had a much larger positive impact on competitive balance in the NHL than overtime approaches have had on the competitive balance of any of the other sports examined.,"[Bowman, R.

The results indicate that while the overall effects of offshoring are small and positive, the future directions of service offshoring are projected to cause sizable domestic job destruction and displacement.

This analysis identifies that the deindustrialization can be the result of a successful and positive transformation or of a pathological and negative transformation of the economy. These are the two fundamental dimensions that determine the turning point of the phenomenon from the perspective of economic development: the mature deindustrialization, as a common trend of economic growth in the advanced countries and the premature deindustrialization, as a structural pattern of the developing countries. This distinction revives the debate on the difference between the determinants of deindustrialization between developed and developing countries and warns about global impact of rapid deindustrialization, which in fact has intensified over time and occurring increasingly earlier in the development process.","[Camacho Ballesta, Jose Antonio] Univ Granada, Dept Econ Int & Espana, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Granada, Spain; [Maldonado Atencio, Alexander Alfonso] Univ Magdalena, Fac Ciencias Empresariales & Econ, Santa Marta, Colombia; [Maldonado Atencio, Alexander Alfonso] Univ Granada, Inst Desarrollo Reg, Granada, Spain",University of Granada; Universidad del Magdalena; University of Granada,"Ballesta, JAC (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Econ Int & Espana, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Granada, Spain.",jcamacho@ugr.es,"Camacho-Ballesta, José A./I-1700-2015; Camacho, José/JCE-9830-2023","Camacho-Ballesta, José A./0000-0002-9786-5400;",,,,,56,1,1,3,25,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Durables prices are estimated to be as sticky as those of nondurables, leading to a flat relative price response to a monetary policy shock. Conversely, house prices are estimated to be almost flexible. Such results survive several robustness checks and a three-sector extension of the NK model.

Bearing this in mind, this article considers economic and ecological performance together, by applying data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist productivity index to investigate the efficiency of the 20 Italian regions from 2004 to 2011. The results reveal that the northern regions have been more efficient than the southern ones, highlighting the strong geographical differences between the two. Furthermore, this article uses the grey system theory to forecast regional, economic and environmental efficiency. The results of the forecasting analysis show that the north-south duality remains strong and will possibly increase since the regions in the south get worse in term of environmental and economic efficiency.","[Carboni, Oliviero A.] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSea, Sassari, Italy; CRENoS, Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Carboni, OA (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSea, Sassari, Italy.",ocarboni@uniss.it,,"russu, paolo/0000-0002-6999-7617",Fondazione Banco di Sardegna [U816.2013/AI.740.MGB Prat. 2013.1425],Fondazione Banco di Sardegna(Fondazione Banco di Sardegna),This work was supported by the Fondazione Banco di Sardegna [U816.2013/AI.740.MGB Prat. 2013.1425].,,97,10,11,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that the advantage each of these banking types holds over the other might not be universal; rather it may be an outcome of the informational and institutional environment in which they operate. In our model, banks optimize both the riskiness of the project and moral hazard concerns to identify the most profitable banking model. We find that state contingent banking is more profitable where projects are riskier, and debt abased conventional banking is adopted for relatively lower risk projects. Our model also suggests that state contingent banking would be the optimal choice in cases where there exist greater moral hazard concerns. We explore the empirical implications of our model and find that state contingent banking would be more suitable for small firms, emerging markets, community and Islamic banking.","[Chaudry, Atif Saeed; Azmat, Saad; Sohail, Maryam] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan",Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Chaudry, AS (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,10,5,5,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Moreover, as income increases, households are more likely to shift from buying conventional milk to organic milk and from private label conventional milk to branded conventional milk, as indicated by the asymmetric cross price elasticities.

For this purpose, we analyze a small open overlapping-generations model in which fertility and an old agent's labor supply (retirement time) are endogenized with pay-as-you-go pension and child allowances. We find that how the pay-as-you-go pension tax rate affects the fertility rate depends on whether an old agent retires. When an old agent fully retires, then the size of the interest rate and fertility rate determine the effect of the pay-as-you-go pension tax rate on the fertility rate. When an old agent works, the pay-as-you-go pension tax rate certainly reduces the fertility rate. In addition, how child allowances affect the fertility rate depends on whether an old agent works. If an old agent retires fully, then an increase in the child allowance tax rate increases the fertility rate. When an old agent works, this is not necessarily true, which suggests that an old agent's labor status should be taken into account when we evaluate the effects of the social security system on economic variables. In addition, we examine the effect of the social security tax rates on welfare and provide numerical examples.","[Chen, Hung-Ju] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Miyazaki, Koichi] Kagawa Univ, Fac Econ, 2-1 Saiwaicho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7608523, Japan",National Taiwan University; Kagawa University,"Miyazaki, K (通讯作者)，Kagawa Univ, Fac Econ, 2-1 Saiwaicho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7608523, Japan.",kmiyazaki@ec.kagawa-u.ac.jp,"CHEN, HUNG-JU/M-1077-2018; Miyazaki, Koichi/AAU-9667-2020","Miyazaki, Koichi/0000-0003-1882-0579",Program for Globalization Studies at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities at National Taiwan University [NTU-ERP-103R890502]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K17086]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17086] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Program for Globalization Studies at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities at National Taiwan University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the Managing Editor, Tiago Cavalcanti, and an anonymous referee for their excellent comments and suggestions.

Our results show that firms exhibiting improvements in investor protection practices manifest a subsequent increase in buy-and-hold abnormal returns. The results further indicate that the changes in the sub-index have different effects on a firm's future performance. Shareholder rights to be rewarded seem to have the most significant and positive effect on a firm's future performance for both local and international investors. Moreover, international investors pay attention to their rights to information. Our results provide evidence in support of the notion that the market does care about firm's investor protection practices.

A growing number of private companies and public organizations are adopting flexible work arrangements (FWAs) to help employees balance their work-family demands, and companies cope with variations in demand, reduce expenses, and be more attractive for employees. Employees representing different age and sex groups have different expectations and priorities towards work, and, it is likely that they evaluate and respond to flexible work practices differently as well. The paper investigates how different genders and generations evaluate and respond to flexibility at work. Empirical research was conducted in Lithuania, 316 employees participated in the poll. According to the research, high expression of flexible work arrangements is observed in Lithuanian organizations. Flexible work schedule and flexible work load are dominating in the organizations. Work flexibility in terms of time and load is more attractive to employees than flexibility in terms of working place. Research revealed that representatives of generations B and Y are most satisfied in the forms of flexible work arrangements applied in their organizations. It was also revealed that women tend to work flexibly slightly more than men; women emphasize coordination of work and family interests, decrease of stress, positive effect on health, time and cost saving, and ability to earn according to their needs.","[Ciarniene, Ramune] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Vienazindiene, Milita] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Studentu St 11, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vytautas Magnus University,"Ciarniene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ramune.ciarniene@ktu.lt; milita.vienazindiene@asu.lt,"Vienažindienė, Milita/ABA-1817-2022","Vienažindienė, Milita/0000-0001-9894-6811",,,,,35,7,19,6,49,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A tax on lending can correct the over-lending problem by reducing the returns from lending. Imposition of the tax has a perverse effect on the composition of lending, however, because it falls more heavily on banks that incur expenses to reduce loan losses. Hence, along the external margin, the share of banks that voluntarily monitor loans decreases. In contrast, monetary policy tightening can produce the optimal level of lending without generating any distortion of monitoring incentives.","[Dia, Enzo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantit & Strategie Impr, Milan, Italy; [Van Hoose, David] Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA",University of Milano-Bicocca; Baylor University,"Dia, E (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantit & Strategie Impr, Milan, Italy.",,,"Dia, Enzo/0000-0002-4602-4011",,,,,25,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Empirical evidence suggests that income and credit constraints can only account for a part of this under-investment. Recent experimental evidence shows that families' misperceptions about the returns to education play a role in their low-investment levels. This paper builds a heterogeneous-agent model of human capital and growth that incorporates an adaptive learning mechanism to capture the way agents form perceptions about returns to education. We find natural conditions guaranteeing existence of stable equilibria. Along transition paths, agents' misperceptions about returns to education depress realized returns, which serves to reenforce and perpetuate low human-capital investment. If human capital investments have both private and public returns, we find multiple stable equilibria, including those which are characterized by low investment and low returns.","[Emerson, Patrick M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Mcgough, Bruce] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Oregon State University; University of Oregon,"Emerson, PM (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",patrick.emerson@oregonstate.edu; bmcgough@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Following financial integration, agents use equity, additional to bonds, to hedge against shocks. The resulting optimal portfolio includes a higher share of bonds denominated in foreign currency and impacts the correlation structure of costs and sales in such a way that producers move towards more local-currency pricing. Both predictions are in line with novel empirical evidence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To examine this issue, we design three experiments where subjects participate in two-player real-effort tournaments with two prizes. Experiment 1 shows that subjects exert high effort even if there are no monetary incentives, suggesting that non-monetary incentives are contributing to their effort choices. Moreover, increasing monetary incentives does not result in higher effort provision. Experiment 2 shows that the impact of non-monetary incentives can be reduced by providing subjects with the option of leaving the laboratory early, using an incentivized timeout button, or working on an incentivized alternative activity. Experiment 3 revisits the relationship between monetary incentives and effort provision using the insights from Experiment 2. Using a design with an incentivized alternative activity, we show that participants increase effort in response to monetary incentives. Taken together, the findings from the three experiments suggest that results from real-effort tasks require a careful evaluation and interpretation of the motivations underlying the observed performance.

In most countries, audit authorities are responsible for monitoring costs but do not distinguish both sources of inefficiency in their audits. Judicial courts typically rely on these cost audits, but only sanction corruption. In a model of public procurement by politicians, we study how the respective quality of the two courts affects corruption as well as cost efficiency. We find that while better courts have the direct effect of decreasing corruption, they may have a negative indirect effect on the abilities of the pool of politicians, so that the net effect on cost efficiency is ambiguous.","[Estache, Antonio] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Estache, Antonio] CEPR, London, England; [Foucart, Renaud] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Foucart, R (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",aestache@ulb.ac.be; renaud.foucart@gmail.com,,"Foucart, Renaud/0000-0003-0611-6146",,,,,40,2,2,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

We employed directional distance functions (DDF) approach both without and with undesirable output (GHG emission). Malmquist-Luenberger indices were employed to measure productivity change. Further they were decomposed to efficiency change and technological change. We found that countries with high eco-efficiency (Netherlands, Italy, Denmark) in agricultural production over 2006-2015, reached relatively high efficiency even disregard their environmental concerns (model without GHG). The New Member States exhibited higher total factor productivity (TFP) growth than the old MS. Significant eco-TFP growth however, was observed mainly in agriculture of the old EU Member States (MS).

Building on other studies, the paper explores the translation of the recent growth to poverty reduction using 1985-2013 PovcalNet (World Bank) data. It assesses the relative abilities of various panel-data methodologies to predict poverty changes based on income-inequality decompositions. Surprisingly, SYSGMM performs substantially worse than Fixed Effects and Random Effects. The analysis is conducted for both the $1.25 and $2.00 poverty lines, and for the 'spread' and 'depth' of poverty, as well as for the usual popular measure, the headcount ratio. Although income growth appears to be the main force behind poverty reduction in Africa, the decomposition reveals striking differences, across countries and poverty measures, with respect to the relative roles of inequality and income.","[Fosu, Augustin Kwasi] Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Ghana; [Fosu, Augustin Kwasi] Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa; [Fosu, Augustin Kwasi] Aalto Univ, Helsinki, Finland",University of Ghana; University of Pretoria; Aalto University,"Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Ghana.;Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.;Fosu, AK (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Helsinki, Finland.",afosu@isser.edu.gh,,,African Development Bank,African Development Bank(CGIAR),"I am grateful to the JAE editor in charge of the manuscript, Doug Gollin, and an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

Self-employment can be persistently hampered by adverse economic conditions at graduation. Family formation and childbearing are temporarily affected by labour market entry conditions, especially for less educated women.

The corresponding losses for the terrorist are counted as costs. The terrorist attacks if benefits outweigh costs. Bounded rationality is enabled where the three kinds of benefits and costs can be weighted differently. We account for two ex ante probabilities of successful planning and attack, and enable the terrorist to assign different weights to its multiple stakeholders. We introduce multiple time periods, time discounting, attitudes towards risk, and subcategories for the benefits and costs. The cost-benefit analysis is illustrated with the 11 September 2001 attack, and 53 incidents in the Global Terrorism Database yielding both positive and negative expected utilities.

In this article, we report the results of a unique choice experiment in which 1255 students were asked about their personal characteristics and their preferences for study abroad programme attributes. Using a random parameters logistic regression model, we find that students attitudes towards risk, their experience with international travel and their beliefs about whether study abroad would help them professionally were major determinants of whether a student expressed interest in studying abroad. We also estimate students' willingness to pay for various programme attributes, including destination, programme duration, course type and the number of experiential learning activities. We find that the highest value programmes give students credit towards their major rather than towards the university core or as an elective and that they are 3-4weeks in length rather than 2 or 6weeks. Also, while students value more experiential learning activities per week, each additional trip adds less value with no additional value beyond four activities.

Results show that variables such as borrowing from informal sources, household labour availability, percentage of total income from agricultural sources, and the household with village cadre have significant positive effects on land transfer-in. Low economic development and low transportation network availability in a county reduces land transfer-in.

Land holding and land idling have U- and L-shaped impacts on land transfer-in, respectively. Land transfer-in has endowment equilibrium and provides Chinese households more opportunities to earn agricultural income, thereby reducing rural poverty.","[Jiang, Meishan] South China Agr Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mi, Yunsheng] South China Agr Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; South China Agricultural University,"Paudel, KP (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.;Paudel, KP (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",kpaudel@agcenter.lsu.edu,,"Paudel, Krishna/0000-0002-9780-5520",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333004]; USDA Hatch/Multi State Project [LAB94358]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16AJY015]; Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [14YJA790039],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); USDA Hatch/Multi State Project; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333004]; USDA Hatch/Multi State Project [grant number LAB94358]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16AJY015]; and Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [14YJA790039].,,7,17,19,5,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Job satisfaction is, however, very complex phenomenon which is influenced by numerous contextual factors as well as job-content factors. Furthermore, there are also numerous factors which have a mediating effect on the relationship between job-related characteristics and job satisfaction. The aim of this paper is to analyze such effects. The main research question of this paper is whether job satisfaction at different career stages is influenced by different job-related characteristics. In order to answer this question, empirical research was conducted using a sample of 813 employees in the companies all over Serbia. The results of the study showed that in most cases job-related characteristics have a diverse influence on job satisfaction at different career stages. The results indicated that job-related characteristics, such as a relationship with co-workers and supervisors, operating procedures as well as communication have a greater influence on job satisfaction at the establishment career stage in comparison to other career stages. Promotion represents a job-related characteristic that has a greater influence on job satisfaction at the advancement stage in comparison to other stages. At the maintenance career stage, fringe benefits are the most influential, while at the decline stage those are contingent rewards. Finally, pay and the nature of work are job-related characteristics which have a similar effect on job satisfaction at all career stages.","[Lepojevic, Vinko; Dordjevic, Biljana; Ivanovic-Djukic, Maja] Univ Nis, Trgkralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis,"Lepojevic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Trgkralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia.",vinko.lepojevic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; biljana.dordjevic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; maja.ivanovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,"Ivanovic-Djukic, Maja/W-2611-2019","Lepojevic, Vinko/0000-0002-8364-1078",,,,,59,1,2,1,14,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

They must look for foreign resources, either in the form of refundable or non-refundable funds, which can lead to the indebtedness of municipalities. Whether or not this debt is incurred, can be ascertained through the burden on the total assets of the municipality by external sources, i.e. the level of the coverage of commitments. This paper analyses the above-mentioned issue of all 300 municipalities of the Moravian-Silesian Region in the period 2010-2016. For this purpose, two indicators were selected and analysed - the share of foreign resources in total assets, including subsidy advances, and the share of foreign resources in total assets without subsidy advances. It was assumed that subsidy advances play an important role in the covering of commitments and have a significant impact on how municipalities are assessed in this respect. Based on the analysis, it was found that the coverage of commitments is not a problem for the municipalities of the Moravian-Silesian Region, both with or without the subsidies.","[Majerova, Ingrid; Szarowska, Irena; Dolak, Radim; Lebiedzik, Marian; Prazak, Tomas; Sebestova, Jarmila; Vymetal, Dominik] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Majerova, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",majerova@opf.slu.cz; szarowska@opf.slu.cz; dolak@opf.slu.cz; lebiedzik@opf.slu.cz; prazak@opf.slu.cz; sebestova@opf.slu.cz; vymetal@opf.slu.cz,"Majerova, Ingrid/AAJ-7666-2021; Pražák, Tomáš/AAA-6021-2021; Majerová, Ingrid/AAA-6448-2021; Dolak, Radim/S-5019-2017; Lebiedzik, Marian/AAA-5979-2021; Šebestová, Jarmila/F-8091-2013; Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Pražák, Tomáš/0000-0002-4119-8530; Majerová, Ingrid/0000-0002-0835-9128; Dolak, Radim/0000-0003-4836-3508; Lebiedzik, Marian/0000-0001-8114-4417; Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455",project Creating methodology and tools for monitoring the financial health of municipalities within the grant program of the Moravian-Silesian Region [02027/2017/FIN],project Creating methodology and tools for monitoring the financial health of municipalities within the grant program of the Moravian-Silesian Region,The paper was financially created and supported within the project Creating methodology and tools for monitoring the financial health of municipalities within the grant program of the Moravian-Silesian Region.

The estimation is performed using new data provided by Central Bank of Ecuador for the period 2007-2014 through a panel econometric technique. The results prove that, despite the strategy aimed at changing the productive matrix pushed by the government, this process is far to be completed.

We develop an economic model where formal trade barriers are eliminated, and resulting sociocultural outcomes such as the adoption of westernized lifestyle in traditional non-western countries prevails, which could imply a health externality. In order to empirically analyse the influence of trade flows on overweight and obesity in Brazil, a balanced fixed-effects panel model has been estimated. Data for the 26 Brazilian states plus the Federal District are run for 1988/1989, 2002 and 2008. We found that an increase in trade openness leads to an increase in overweight and obesity ratios in Brazil. Hence results seem to point that there is a health externality in Brazil due to trade liberalization. However, more consistent evidence may be necessary to convince politicians and policymakers that any interference will be necessary to correct this externality.","[Miljkovic, Dragan] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 500 Barry Hall,NDSU Dept 7610, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [de Miranda, Silvia H.

In the twentieth century, with the dynamic development of financial markets and the products offered on them, various types of financial exclusions (pension, investment, credit, savings, payment, insurance) appeared. The article presents the results of surveys on the perception of the financial exclusion phenomenon carried out on a group of 1807 representatives. The purpose of these studies was to attempt to assess the knowledge of issues related to the phenomenon of financial exclusion in the analyzed age group of Poles and to identify determinants that in their opinion directly affect the occurrence of this phenomenon. In the first part of the article presents the level of knowledge of issues related to financial exclusion among representatives. Next, the reasons indicated by the respondents and people potentially at risk of exclusion were presented.

The empirical results are based on annual time series data for six country groups as well as cross-sectional data covering a large number of countries. The model is initially specified with unobserved components and estimated in a time-varying parametric framework to account for missing variables. Thereafter, the issue of linear versus quadratic specifications is examined. The results are robust with respect to model specification, estimation method, data type and variable definition, showing in general that financialization has a negative impact on growth.

Factor Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) methodology has been used, which contains 115 monthly macroeconomic variables for the period January 1992 to December 2010. An unanticipated increase in discount rate reduces output at aggregate level, i.e. industrial production index (IPI); however, individual commodities do not show the same behavior. The result reveals that monetary policy has heterogeneous effect on production and has real effects in the short run and it can help in increasing growth if used effectively. A tight monetary policy leads towards decline in consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI) at aggregate level. However, there is strong heterogeneity among prices in Pakistan following a shock in monetary policy flowing from change in discount rate. Some of the prices show flexibility, while others show a sluggish behavior. A shock in monetary policy transmits to wholesale prices earlier than to consumer prices. The main policy implications are that monetary policy has real effects in the short run and interest rate negatively influences prices with heterogeneous effects.","[Munir, Kashif] Univ Cent Punjab, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Central Punjab,"Munir, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Punjab, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan.",kashif.munir@ucp.edu.pk,"Munir, Kashif/M-5932-2017","Munir, Kashif/0000-0003-0185-4350",,,,,42,2,2,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Unrestricted and polynomial distributed lag models are used to assess the impact of past expert quality ratings on the prices of Australian premium wines. Results point to the practical unimportance of current wine quality scores impacting prices and suggest that quality score lag effects up to six years may be important. The largest individual lagged impact of quality on price is estimated to occur at approximately two years, and prices are estimated to increase by more than 10% over six years for a one-point quality score increase. A procedure for identifying potential wine price bargains based on a comparison of price predictions from estimated wine reputation and current quality measures is illustrated.

Using a comprehensive panel of Spanish firms for the period 2004-2011, the empirical analysis conducted shows that distinct types of obstacle are perceived differently by firms of different ages. First, a clear-cut negative relationship is identified between firm age and a firm's assessment of both the internal and external shortages of financial resources. Second, young firms seem to be less sensitive to the lack of qualified personnel when initiating an innovative project than when they are already engaged in such activities. By contrast, the attempts of mature firms to engage in innovation activity are significantly affected by the lack of qualified personnel. Finally, mature incumbents appear to attach greater importance to obstacles related to market structure and demand than is the case of firms with less experience.","[Pellegrino, Gabriele] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol Technol & Publ Policy, EPFL CDM ITPP IIPP, ODY 2 19,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Pellegrino, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Management Technol Technol & Publ Policy, EPFL CDM ITPP IIPP, ODY 2 19,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",gabriele-pellegrino@hotmail.it,,,,,,,65,42,46,3,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

A history with twenty constitutions characterizes an unstable nation vulnerable to grandiose, illiberal populism, and the few liberal advances have tended to be top-down political calculations. One bright spot has been dollarization in 2000, which derived from the general populace and better protected earnings and wealth and stabilized the economy. The rise of the Citizen Revolution under President Rafael Correa (2007-2017), in solidarity with other socialist regimes in Latin America, has put Ecuador into a fiscal crisis and ushered in a modern authoritarian and corrupt regime, noted by many international human-rights and economic watchdog organizations.

We analyze equilibrium predictions, isolate the causal effects of guilt sharing, and compare results to standard utilitarian and non-consequentialist approaches.

While standard measures of market efficiency characterized the Major League Baseball win-loss moneyline market to be efficient, previous works shows that wagering on underdogs early in the season can generate persistent profits. Though the overall efficiency of the baseball wagering market remained after publication, these profitable opportunities dissipated.

It was found that, contrasting the classical result of Uzawa's theorem, in order for technological innovations in the long term to be purely labor-saving, the production model must have the following characteristics: 1) the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital must be less than one and 2) the expansion of the technological frontier must only due to the increase of innovations that save work in the long term.

The empirical results indicate that the wavelet correlations between the industry CDS and stock returns are primarily negative over time and across time scales. Moreover, the CDS-stock correlation at longer horizons exhibits a much more stable pattern than its counterpart at shorter time frames. The results also demonstrate that the volatility of US Treasury and stock markets, as measured by the MOVE and VIX indices, respectively, the volatility of volatility, as captured by the VVIX index, and US economic policy uncertainty, as measured by the EPU index, are the most robust determinants of the correlation between CDS and stock returns at shorter and longer horizons for most US industries.

However, the empirical evidence in the debt repurchase literature shows that a combination of debt and equity, along with asset sales is used in renegotiation. In this paper we analyze the use of equity financing in addition to debt financing and asset sales in debt repurchases. Firms with larger volatility, lower cash flow growth rates, or higher recovery rates are more likely to use equity financing in debt renegotiation. Flotation and renegotiation costs, the bargaining power of the creditors, and macroeconomic variables also influence this choice. When equity issuance is a possible source of financing in renegotiation, firms optimally choose smoother coupons and welfare increases as compared to pure debt for debt swaps. We provide closed-form solutions for the optimal use of funding and we derive novel testable empirical implications regarding the use of equity financing in debt repurchases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, in response to the usage of measures of subjective well-being as indices of welfare in economics, a number of economists have started to develop measures of welfare based on preference-satisfaction. In order to evaluate the success of such measures, I formulate criteria of policy-relevance and theoretical success in the context of preference-satisfaction measures of welfare. I present a detailed case study of the methodological choices put forward in a prominent generalized proposal for measuring welfare through preferences recently published in the American Economic Review. I contrast this with an alternative welfare measure which also uses preferences to weight aspects of welfare: the ICECAP-A measure. I assess the methodology of both approaches in detail and argue that the two goals of a preference measure of welfare can only be satisfied at the expense of making a measure prohibitively costly.","[van der Deijl, Willem] Erasmus Univ, Fac Philosophy, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"van der Deijl, W (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Eth, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",wjavanderdeijl@gmail.com,,"van der Deijl, Willem/0000-0002-8190-2705",,,,,47,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

When joining such programmes, employees can deepen their existing knowledge, acquire new knowledge and develop their abilities and skills. The goal of the article is to identify the approaches of using talent programmes in the Czech Republic, which lead to building of the employer image. The sub-goal is to test defined hypotheses in order to formulate recommendations of applicable approaches to work with talents. The results were achieved by the means of quantitative research (n=134) carried out among employees of organisations who take part in a talent programme. For the purposes of testing, the Pearson's chi-square test and the association test were employed. The results show that there exists a difference in the talent programme placement between managers and employees (p=0.027). The other characteristics are not significant for the selection of a talent programme. Additionally, multidimensional statistics were used to find two types of organisations related to the use of talent programmes to build employer's image. First type are the organisations focused on HR marketing, and the second typye - lacking transparency in employer branding. The outputs alow us to define crucial components of succesfull employer branding. The paper contains an in-depth discussion of the concept of building employer image as well as identifies the main determinants connected with it. Moreover, the paper presents new research findings by defining and validating the main attributes of the employer image. The limits of the article can be deemed to consist in a relatively small sample of respondents; however, with respect to the exclusive approach to the talent management in the Czech Republic, the sample can be described as sufficient.","[Vnouckova, Lucie] Univ Econ & Management, Educ & Res, Dept Management, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Smolova, Helena] Univ Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Urbancova, Hana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Vnouckova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Educ & Res, Dept Management, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",lucie.vnouckova@vsem.cz; urbancova@pef.czu.cz; helena.smolova@vsem.cz,"Depoo, Lucie/ABE-4039-2020; Urbancova, Hana/K-5663-2015","Depoo, Lucie/0000-0003-4296-875X; Urbancova, Hana/0000-0001-6603-8691",project of University of Economics and Management and of the University - wide internal grant agency (CIGA) [20141002],project of University of Economics and Management and of the University - wide internal grant agency (CIGA),"This contribution is a follow-up to the project of University of Economics and Management and of the University - wide internal grant agency (CIGA), number 20141002 - Human Resource Branding Using of the New Strategic Trends in Organizations in the Czech Republic.",,68,3,4,1,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, how people derive utility from these factors has not been fully explored. This article provides a way to decompose the gross effect of major determinants on life satisfaction into direct and indirect effects and make inference for the latter. Because the indirect effect is nonlinear in parameters associated with different models in an equation system, it creates a problem in estimating the standard error. Besides, the categorical nature in survey data further introduces bias to the covariance estimation even asymptotically. To address these issues without knowing the form of heteroskedasticity under the null hypothesis, we propose to extend the wild bootstrap procedure in this particular context. Its robustness against various data properties is validated via several simulation experiments. Using three recent waves of World Values Survey, we find that the relative importance of life control has significantly increased recently, and endowing citizens with the right to enjoy their freedoms and liberties is a more effective policy in raising life satisfaction than promoting national income.","[Wan, Shui Ki] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, WLB,34 Renfrew Rd, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Long] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Alberta,"Wan, SK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, WLB,34 Renfrew Rd, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",shuiki@hkbu.edu.hk,,"Wan, Shui Ki/0000-0001-6131-9830; Zhao, Long/0000-0002-9358-7669",,,,,24,4,5,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Countries, most especially developing ones, are highly susceptible to investment volatility owing largely to the fragile nature of their economies as well as weaknesses in terms of dysfunctional institutions. Therefore, sound economic management suggests the need to better understand possible sources for mitigating the adverse effects of investment volatility. Remittances have been identified as important capital flows which do a good job of dousing macroeconomic volatilities. It is on this basis that the study sought to uncover the causal relationship between remittances and investment volatility via the intermediating role of institutions. Using a panel of 70 countries and the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, three insightful outcomes come to the fore. First, remittances played countercyclical roles across the estimated regressions. Second, institutional quality had no significant role in mitigating investment volatility and lastly, the interactive terms of both remittances and institutions significantly mitigated the negative impacts of investment volatility with the exception of the political component of the institutional architecture. Policy suggestions are drawn based on our results.","[Raheem, Ibrahim D.] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ajide, Kazeem B.] Univ Lagos, Dept Econ, Lagos, Nigeria; [Adeniyi, Oluwatosin] Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Kent; University of Lagos; University of Ibadan,"Raheem, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England.",idr6@kent.ac.uk,"Adeniyi, Oluwatosin/R-8231-2019","ajide, bello/0000-0001-6363-9483",,,,,62,3,3,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Data from these practice auctions are rarely reported in scientific papers. We argue that valuable information can be garnered by looking at data coming from the training rounds of experimental auctions. We provide evidence that if we had neglected insights gained from the training auction data, we would not have been able to detect a failure of randomization to treatment that rendered us biased estimates of the true causal effects due to unobserved heterogeneity. As a case study, we use data from an experiment that seeks to elaborate on the mediating role of mood states on projection bias. Following a mood induction procedure, subjects are found to bid more under negative mood (as compared to positive mood) for products that are delivered in the future but bid less under negative mood for products that are delivered in present time. We show that information from the training auction rounds render the observed effect a biased estimate, which is likely a consequence of the failure of randomization to treatment.","[Briz, Teresa] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETS Ingenieros Agronomos, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Drichoutis, Andreas C.] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Agricultural University of Athens; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Drichoutis, AC (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.",teresa.briz@upm.es; adrihout@aua.gr; rnayga@uark.edu,"Drichoutis, Andreas/AAM-6580-2020; BRIZ DE FELIPE, TERESA/F-8962-2016","Drichoutis, Andreas/0000-0002-4082-4560; BRIZ DE FELIPE, TERESA/0000-0002-0291-7870",,,,,60,9,9,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

This paper describes how the best designs satisfy the twin goals of short-run efficiency-making the best use of existing resources-and long-run efficiency-promoting efficient investment in new resources. The core elements are a day-ahead market for optimal scheduling of resources and a real-time market for security-constrained economic dispatch. Resources directly offer to produce per their underlying economics and then the system operator centrally optimizes all resources to maximize social welfare. Locational marginal prices, reflecting the marginal value of energy at each time and location, are used in settlement. This spot market provides the basis for forward contracting, which enables participants to manage risk and improves bidding incentives in the spot market. There are important differences in electricity markets around the world, reflecting different economic and political settings. Electricity markets are undergoing a transformation as the resource mix transitions from fossil fuels to renewables. The main renewables, wind and solar, are intermittent, have zero marginal cost, and lack inertia. These challenges can be met with battery storage and improved demand response. However, good governance is needed to assure the market rules adapt to meet new challenges.","[Cramton, Peter] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Cramton, Peter] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Cramton, Peter] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; European University Institute; University of Cologne,"Cramton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Cramton, P (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.;Cramton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",pcramton@gmail.com,"Cramton, Peter/ABG-7651-2021","Cramton, Peter/0000-0001-8621-1092",University of Cologne through the Key Profile Area II,University of Cologne through the Key Profile Area II,"Since 1983, Peter Cramton has conducted research on market design; he has applied that research to design auction-based markets of radio spectrum, electricity, financial securities, and other products.

OECD prepared 15 BEPS actions, which set countermeasures to fight tax avoidance in a coordinated way and shall be implement by countries on a voluntary basis. Literature review revealed that on a macro-level and company-level the extent of BEPS is large and statistically significant while studies addressing micro-level (transaction-level) impact and BEPS countermeasures' related issues are limited. Purpose of the article: to identify methods and metrics available for evaluation of BEPS countermeasures' impact on a micro-level and to assess BEPS countermeasures' impact on a business group. Methods: the paper employs comparative analysis of scientific and professional literature to identify approaches and methods available for evaluation of BEPS countermeasures' impact on a micro-level; and a case analysis method to assess an expected impact of BEPS countermeasures on a specific business group. Findings & Value added: An approach used to estimate BEPS countermeasures impact on the micro-level differs from the one applied in macro-level analysis. To conduct the case analysis, OECD's proposed macro-level fiscal impact assessment approach has been adapted for a micro-level analysis. It includes the analysis of the transactions subject to BEPS countermeasures and develops an action plan to manage related risks. The conducted case analysis differs from previous research as it employs transaction-level data and estimates fiscal effect of BEPS countermeasures on a micro-level. Analysis of the activities of the specific business group revealed that 5 from 15 countermeasures are relevant and directly applicable to this business group. They would not have an immediate significant direct fiscal effect, but risks related to BEPS countermeasures exist and action plans to manage negative effects of BEPS countermeasures have to be implemented.","[Legenzova, Renata; Levisauskaite, Kristina; Kundelis, Egidijus] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Legenzova, R (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Econ & Management, S Daukanto 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",renata.legenzova@vdu.lt,"Legenzova, Renata/X-5448-2019","Legenzova, Renata/0000-0002-5987-033X",,,,,23,3,3,4,26,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Despite the general emphasis to the benefits of implementation of ISO 9001 in the literature, there is a still lack of research concerning the actual impact of quality management systems for improving specific logistics processes. The research is focused on the Polish market because there is no research in the subject literature which concerns the impact of the implementation of quality management systems on the improvement of logistic processes in Polish enterprises. Purpose of the article: The focus of this publication was to examine the impact of the implementation of the requirements of ISO 9001 for process improvement supply logistics. Methods: Empirical studies were carried out in September and October 2014 on a group of 17 companies with implemented and certified quality management systems according to ISO 9001. The research tool was a questionnaire survey sent to management representatives (25 respondents) and workers (140 respondents). The surveys were supplemented with direct interviews with employees of the companies. Findings: Based on the survey it can be stated that the quality management systems, according to ISO 9001, had a fairly large impact on improving procurement processes. This is particularly evident in areas including relationships with suppliers, quality control, workflow and communication, both internal and external. The positive aspects achieved through the implementation of quality management systems due to the fact that the ISO 9001 standard in its commitments puts great emphasis on the organization of the procurement process.","[Zimon, Dominik] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Zimon, D (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Management Syst & Logist, Al Powstancow Warszawy 8, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland.",zdomin@prz.edu.pl,"Zimon, Dominik/W-1634-2017","Zimon, Dominik/0000-0002-3097-5445",,,,,24,10,10,2,21,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We consider a nonlinear monetary policy rule which, in each period, bounds the money growth rate so that money is determined by the deviation of the inflation rate from its target. More precisely, we introduce such a mechanism through a sigmoidal money adjustment mechanism characterized by the presence of two asymptotes that bound the money variation, and thus the dynamics. It is shown that, depending on the timing of the monetary policy and the degree of reaction of the Central Bank, the target equilibrium may be destabilized via different types of bifurcations. Multistability and coexistence of attractors may also occur and the study of the basins of attraction allows us to analyze the global dynamic properties of the economy under scrutiny. We find that active monetary policy rules may be relevant for their stabilizing properties, but they also may open the door to equilibrium cycles of any periodicity and even chaos.","[Agliari, Anna; Pecora, Nicolo] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy; [Naimzada, Ahmad] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Quantitat Methods & Management, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Pecora, N (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy.",anna.agliari@unicatt.it; ahmad.naimzada@unimib.it; nicolo.pecora@unicatt.it,"Agliari, Anna/Q-6612-2019","Agliari, Anna/0000-0002-5230-9304",,,,,50,3,3,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We show that the certification standard for an environmental quality is lowered when firms have strong power. A certifier with too low bargaining power will prefer to sell to the best offer rather than bargain. This switch in the selling mechanism also thwarts his incentives in setting the standard. This is consequential for evaluating policies. The dimensions and even signs of welfare changes induced by taxes and subsidies depend upon the mechanism used, and ultimately upon firms' countervailing power.","[Barry, Ibrahima; Bonroy, Olivier] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRA, UMR GAEL, Grenoble, France; [Garella, Paolo G.] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Milan, Italy",INRAE; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Milan,"Bonroy, O (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRA, UMR GAEL, Grenoble, France.",olivier.bonroy@inra.fr,"Garella, Paolo/AAE-5743-2020","Garella, Paolo/0000-0002-6830-4786; Bonroy, Olivier/0000-0002-3589-1961; BARRY, IBRAHIMA/0000-0002-7140-8826",,,,,28,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

A quantitative version of the model matches well estimates of enrollment elasticities, variation in need-based and merit-based institutional aid with, respectively, student income and ability, and aggregate characteristics of U.S. higher education including college attendance in public and private schools, tuition levels, and the provision of federal aid. Predictions about the provision of federal aid and the distribution of students across colleges by ability and income match the empirical counterparts well. We use the model to examine the consequences of federal and state aid policies. A one-third increase in the maximum federal aid increases college attendance by 6% of the initial college population, most of the increase being in state colleges and mainly of poor students. Elite private colleges reduce institutional aid and use the net funding gain to spend more on educational inputs and to substitute some highly able poor students for less able rich students. Reductions in federal or state aid result in substantially reduced attendance mainly by poor students. Reductions of support to state colleges induce private colleges to increase enrollments modestly and improve in quality as demand shifts toward them. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It studies how the dynamics of a two-dimensional discrete time map evolves by focusing on changes either in the degree of product differentiation or the managerial power in the market share bonus. By combining mathematical techniques and numerical experiments, it shows that the Nash equilibrium of the game may not describe the long-term outcomes of the market. This holds because the fixed point of the map may be unstable or because different attractors (simple or chaotic) may capture the long-term dynamics of the model. The article also analyzes market dynamics when a new potential entrant tries to enter or, alternatively, a firm that was already in the market closes down and then tries to re-enter in a context where there is already an incumbent with a strictly positive quantity. The potential entrant may be subject to entry barriers or enters the market depending on the structure of consumers' preferences and the demands of products of both varieties. In particular, the article analyzes some economic consequences of the non-invertibility of the map in the entry process.","[Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Piazzale E Brignole 3a, I-16125 Genoa, Liguria, Italy; [Pecora, Nicolo] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29100 Piacenza, PC, Italy; [Sodini, Mauro] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, PI, Italy",University of Genoa; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Pisa,"Gori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Piazzale E Brignole 3a, I-16125 Genoa, Liguria, Italy.",luca.gori@unige.it; nicolo.pecora@unicatt.it; mauro.sodini@unipi.it,"Sodini, Mauro/R-1776-2016","Sodini, Mauro/0000-0002-8237-8941; Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,29,8,9,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Marx describes competition as an 'external coercive law', which imposes capital logic over the individual and the overall society, regulates the reproduction of class relations and produces a number of economic tendencies.

We use a general theoretical construct to answer the question of how the price elasticity of tourism demand, income elasticity of tourism demand, and the concentration in the service sector influence the economic development of small economies. One of the main results is that the policy planners in small open economies may consider specific policies to influence the strength of market competition. An ensuing effect of such policies is that the labor incomes will increase. The approach provides a microeconomic foundation for macroeconomic modeling which can be used for applied research, and the model can be easily extended to examine other dimensions of economic development.","[Stauvermann, Peter Josef] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Global Business & Econ, Gyeongnam 9, Sarim Dong 641773, Changwon, South Korea; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ South Pacific, Sch Accounting & Finance, Fac Business & Econ Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ Bolton, Bolton Business Sch, Deane Rd, Bolton BL3 5AB, England",Changwon National University; University of the South Pacific; University of Leicester; University of Bolton,"Kumar, RR (通讯作者)，Univ South Pacific, Sch Accounting & Finance, Fac Business & Econ Laucala Campus, Suva, Fiji.",kumar_RN@usp.ac.fj,"Stauvermann, Peter Josef/I-3470-2019; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015","Stauvermann, Peter Josef/0000-0001-7011-2209; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896",Changwon National University,Changwon National University,"The authors sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor of the journal, Professor Dr. Neri Salvadori, for their comments and advice.

J,"Takongmo, COM",,,,"Takongmo, Charles Olivier Mao",,,Government-spending multipliers and the zero lower bound in an open economy,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SHOCKS; POLICY; RATES,"This paper assesses the size of the government-spending multiplier in an open economy when the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the nominal interest rate is binding. In a theoretical framework, in a closed economy, other authors have shown that when the nominal interest rate is binding the government-spending multiplier can be very large (close to four). Their theory helps illuminate the government-spending multiplier in the ZLB, but it is difficult to match that theory with the data. We argue that, in an open economy, another channel exists for the crowding-out effect via the real exchange rate. For an open economy, the government-spending multiplier is not large owing to the appreciation of the real exchange rate, induced by the appreciation of aggregate demand that follows the increases in government spending. To test the robustness of our open economic model, we conduct the same analysis in a corresponding closed economy model. The result from our closed economy model confirms the result obtained in the other work. Our theoretical results are consistent with the results obtained in the empirical literature, which uses the vector autoregressive method and the structural vector autoregressive approach to measure the impact of government-spending shock on the real gross domestic product and revealed that the government-spending multiplier tends to be lower in open economy.","[Takongmo, Charles Olivier Mao] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Takongmo, COM (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ,Social Sci Bldg,Room 9005, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",maotcharles@yahoo.fr,,"MAO TAKONGMO, Charles Olivier/0000-0003-1659-5806",,,,,19,6,6,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

J,"Towse, R",,,,"Towse, Ruth",,,Economics of music publishing: copyright and the market,JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Copyright; Business model; Music publishing; Creative industries,INCENTIVES,"The paper argues that the paradigmatic shift from the sale of printed music to exploiting and managing musical rights that took place in music publishing during the early years of the twentieth century was due to the changing market rather than to changes in copyright law. On the one hand, copyright law was ineffectual in controlling piracy throughout the nineteenth century, and on the other hand, performing rights were ignored by music publishers for over 70 years; these points suggest that copyright was not the main reason behind the success of the industry. Rather than leading entrepreneurially (the current view of dynamism in the creative industries), publishers 'followed the money' and adapted their business models only when new streams of income from new forms of exploitation through sound recording, broadcasting and film became available as a result of exogenous technical progress. Publishers were locked-in to sales revenue as their business model, though when switching to the new business model of rights management took place, the costs seem not to have been greatly significant. The paper takes an historical approach to the development of music publishing viewed through the lens of present-day issues. The research has resonance for the transition from sales to licensing digital works that is taking place in the creative industries today and puts into perspective the relative significance of market forces and copyright law in the process.","[Towse, Ruth] Bournemouth Univ, CIPPM, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Towse, Ruth] Univ Glasgow, Cultural Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Towse, Ruth] Langsford Barn, Peter Tavy PL19 9LY, Tavistock, England",Bournemouth University; University of Glasgow,"Towse, R (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, CIPPM, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.;Towse, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Cultural Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Towse, R (通讯作者)，Langsford Barn, Peter Tavy PL19 9LY, Tavistock, England.",Ruth.towse@gmail.com,,"Towse, Ruth/0000-0002-8020-7583",UK's Arts and Humanities Research Board [AH/L004666/1]; AHRC [AH/L004666/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK's Arts and Humanities Research Board; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The research for this article was financed by a grant from the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Board for the project 'Economic Survival in a Long Established Creative Industry: Strategies, Business Models and Copyright in Music Publishing' (AH/L004666/1) at Bournemouth University.

The article explores ethical perceptions among 'internal accountants' and those working in companies operating as providers of external accounting services. Since external accounting services companies are not specifically regulated by the profession, we hypothesise that accountants working in external accounting service companies are more lenient to ethically-sensitive scenarios. Moreover, we analyse if ethical perceptions differ between accountants having a professional certificate and those that do not. We believe those that have a certificate are harsher towards ethically-sensitive scenarios. For the purpose of our analysis a questionnaire was distributed to accounting professionals. Our analysis is made on a large sample of 451 accountants. Results of ordered probit regression support the first two hypotheses, despite the fact that not all of the vignettes resulted as statistically significant. Our study contributes to the literature in that the ethics of accountants from countries with non-regulated markets of accounting services have not yet been investigated in the literature.","[Odar, Marjan; Kavcic, Slavka] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Jerman, Mateja] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Jamnik, Anton] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Theol, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Primorska; University of Ljubljana,"Jerman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia.",mateja.jerman@fm-kp.si,,,,,,,31,4,5,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Although enrollment initially grew in these markets, enrollment has fallen recently amid insurer exits and rising premiums. To better understand these markets, we estimate premium elasticity of demand for Marketplace plans, using within-plan premium changes from 2014 to 2015, accounting for state-specific trends and simultaneous changes in generosity. Our preferred estimate implies that a one percent premium increase reduces plan-specific enrollment by 1.7 percent. We argue that this high elasticity reflects the rapid growth and high churn in this market, as well as the high degree of standardization and the availability of many close substitutes.

We examine separate gasoline and diesel demand models using a set of estimators on a panel of 16 Spanish regions over the period 1999-2015. The paper confirms the persistence of low own-price elasticities both for diesel and gasoline in the short and long runs. It also shows that the crisis of 2008-2013 slightly increased the price elasticity of demand for transport fuels, with a higher effect on diesel than on gasoline. By contrary, the crisis slightly reduced the income elasticity of transport fuel demand. Given the intensity and length of the economic recession in Spain, the results of this paper may be useful to anticipate the effects of domestic public policies that impact transport fuel prices as well as to advance some of the potential consequences of crises elsewhere.

Results indicate that innovation has a sizable, positive impact on financial and insurance services exports. This holds true when examining a country's aggregate level of insurance and financial services exports, as well as bilateral exports to a specific trade partner. However, robustness tests suggest that the positive effect of innovation on bilateral financial and insurance services exports holds true only at the extensive margin of trade (i.e. the decision to export), but not at the intensive margin (i.e. how much to export).","[Briggs, Kristie] Creighton Univ, Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA",Creighton University,"Briggs, K (通讯作者)，Creighton Univ, Econ & Finance, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",kristiebriggs@creighton.edu,,"Briggs, Kristie/0000-0002-3801-7057",,,,,34,1,1,1,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using Thai historical data, first, we study the tail characteristics of the distributions of two Thai baht instability measures and 21 economic fundamentals. Then, we test asymptotic dependence between the currency instability measures and lagged economic fundamentals. Empirically, we find that the distributions of both currency instability measures and economic variables are heavy tailed. Assuming a normal distribution for the variables tends to underestimate the probability of extreme events. Furthermore, most of the economic variables which are usually used as signalling indicators for currency crises are asymptotically independent of the currency instability measures. Signals issued by these variables are thus not reliable. Nevertheless, the non-parametric EVT approach facilitates the selection of economic indicators with credible signals and high crisis prediction success.","[Cumperayot, Phornchanok] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Cumperayot, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",Phornchanok.C@chula.ac.th,,"Cumperayot, Phornchanok/0000-0001-8951-4670","faculty of economics, Chulalongkorn University","faculty of economics, Chulalongkorn University(Chulalongkorn University)","This article is part of a project under the same title, funded by the faculty of economics, Chulalongkorn University.

To what extent can governments affect inequality? Which instruments should they use? Answering these questions requires understanding why people save. Dynamic quantitative models of wealth inequality can help us to understand and quantify the determinants of the outcomes that we observe in the data and to evaluate the consequences of policy reform.

Assuming that non-signatories are price takers in the fuel market, Harstad (2012) designs a policy of trading deposits that attains efficiency despite the coalition's option to act strategically in the fuel market. The deposit transactions constituting that policy include the trade of deposits which the non-signatories would have exploited and the coalition will exploit. The present paper shows that in a proper subset of economies a simpler policy is (also) efficient that consists of deposit purchases for preservation only. In these economies the coalition is unable to raise its welfare above the level in the benchmark case of fuel price taking. In the economies, where the efficient policy requires deposit transactions for exploitation, the coalition is better off and the non-signatories are worse off than in case of price taking.

It is one of several potential mega-regional FTAs in the Asia-Pacific region. In this paper we investigate the potential effect of RCEP on foreign direct investment (FDI) with a focus on China using an innovative computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The model is built on the theory of firm heterogeneity extended to FDI. The framework is able to capture FDI increases along both the intensive and extensive margins. Liberalization under RCEP is simulated as impacting on FDI both directly through FDI liberalization and indirectly through trade liberalization. Our simulation results suggest that RCEP would encourage significant increases in FDI to China through both these pathways. While competition from imports drives out the least productive foreign owned firms, export expansion of firms using FDI will lead to an overall increase in foreign investment. In addition, the facilitation of trade in intermediate goods tends to promote vertical FDI. The direct FDI effect from investment liberalization will evidently promote FDI from partners. Projected economic gains to China from RCEP are in the range of US$103-214 billion, or 1.1-2.2% of GDP.","[Li, Qiaomin] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Scollay, Robert] Univ Auckland, Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand; [Gilbert, John] Utah State Univ, Huntsman Sch Business, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Northwest University Xi'an; University of Auckland; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Li, QM (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",qli091@qq.com,"Gilbert, John P/A-9031-2009",,China Scholarship Council,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"We acknowledge the useful discussions with Anna Strutt, Edward Tower and Peter Dixon.

It was developed for a world of fixed or semi-fixed exchange rates and low capital mobility. Although the literature has addressed new problems, such as the balance sheet effects, the literature has not considered the implications for the administration of an Inflation Targeting regime. Methods: We analyze the stability conditions of a stylized model that describes mainly the Latin-American economies, combining contractionary effects from devaluations with monetary policy rules. Results: When devaluations are contractionary exchange rate movements can be destabilizing. Stability is more likely if the Central Bank does not targets the output-gap. Foreign exchange reserve accumulation policies increase the likelihood of having a stable system. Conclusions: Contractionary effects from devaluations complicates the administration of monetary policy if Inflation Targeting is operative. Policies that aim to regulate capital flows, combined with foreign exchange reserve accumulation, can improve the Inflation Targeting regime.","[Libman, Emiliano] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires,"Libman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",emilianolibman@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,0,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Using daily data from January 2004 to May 2016 for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, a DCC-GARCH model is used to estimate dynamic correlations and hedge ratios. We find significant spillovers from oil to equities, highlighting the heavy dependence of the local economies on oil. Moreover, the spillovers of gold on the stock markets are insignificant, suggesting that gold price fluctuations do not necessarily influence equity investment decisions. In the opposite direction, we find that equities do not exert significant influence on the two commodities, which we attribute to the relatively small capitalisation of the exchanges. Our results reveal low dynamic correlations and hedge ratios, with a few spikes during crises, indicating that oil and gold are cheap hedges for stocks, albeit not good ones, while they could be considered as weak safe havens, but at a considerable cost.

We show that, when a unique stochastically stable outcome exists, a norm of investment and a norm of division coevolve supporting the efficient investment profile and the egalitarian distribution of the surplus, respectively.

An innovative Early Warning System (EWS) is introduced that allows to unveil prodromic signals of instability for selected individual banks, and possibly forecast bank failures. A forward-looking, credit risk model that is based on financial ratios is designed to assess the financial position of rated banks. This approach allows to discriminate between banks that are in a stable, financially healthy position, and banks that are possibly going to become insolvent (likely-to-fail banks). Our empirical results are compared with the official ratings assigned by RAs to the same intermediaries. Our findings reveal incoherent positions and possibly incorrectly rated banks. We argue that our method can be easily implemented by financial regulators. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Within a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with an endogenous market for housing, I consider the case of rational expectations subject to imperfect information about the persistence of exogenous shocks. I evaluate the performance of the model against the last 40 years of key U.S. macroeconomic data. Bayesian comparison strongly favors the model over the baseline case with perfect information. Under imperfect information, agents rely on learning to form expectations, which improves the ability of the model to generate realistic low-frequency house-price dynamics. However, as long as the agents form expectations rationally, the improvement is limited. Furthermore, to confine price inertia within the housing market is a challenge for the general-equilibrium approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, this effect is reduced by 60% from the start of the economic crisis. This is not a drawback for this measure of minimum wages, which is relative in nature, to be used as a common European reference in the fight against economic inequality.

The results show that mother's education is not an important determinant of the education of adopted children, despite statistically significant effects for own-birth children. The results for fathers are different. Among adopted white children, the effect of father's education is shown to be a statistically significant determinant of grade retention. However, among black children, adoptive father's education does not appear to have any discernible effect on children's education. A range of sensitivity tests are undertaken to check the validity of these results. The differences in these patterns between white and black students suggest the presence of racial differences in the intergenerational transmission of education.","[Silles, Mary A.] Hull Univ, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Silles, MA (通讯作者)，Hull Univ, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",,,,,,,,45,2,3,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2017,84.0,336,,,,,748,778,,10.1111/ecca.12240,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FF3OI,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408815800008,0

Only when heterogeneity is assumed Pareto-distributed do all elasticities collapse into a unique elasticity, estimable with a gravity equation. This paper provides a theory-consistent methodology for quantifying country-pair specific aggregate elagticities when moving away from Pareto, i.e. when gravity does not hold. Combining two firm-level customs datasets for which we observe French and Chinese individual sales on the same destination market over the 2000-2006 period, we are able to estimate all the components of the bilateral aggregate elasticity: i) the demand-side parameter that governs the intensive margin and ii) the supply side parameters that drive the extensive margin, These components are then used to calculate theoretical predictions of bilateral aggregate elasticities over the whole set of destinations, and how those elasticities decompose into different margins. Our predictions fit well with econometric estimates, supporting our view that micro-data is a key element in the quantification of aggregate trade elasticities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We first show by way of simulations that the amount of consumer-specific information that is optimally revealed to advertisers increases with the degree of competition on the advertising market and decreases with the cost of information disclosure for a monopolistic platform, competing platforms or a welfare-maximizing platform, provided the advertising market is not highly concentrated. Second, we exhibit different properties between the welfare-maximizing situation and the imperfectly competitive market situations with respect to how the incremental value of information varies: there are decreasing social returns to consumers' data, while private returns may be increasing or decreasing locally.","[de Nijs, Romain] CREST Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [Bourreau, Marc] Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France; [Romain, Bernard Caillaud] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Paris School of Economics; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"de Nijs, R (通讯作者)，CREST Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France.",romain.de-nijs@polytechnique.edu,,,France Strategie,France Strategie,"This research has been financed by France Strategie, within the general framework of a Research Project on the Evolution of the Value created by the Digital Economy and its Fiscal Consequences, signed between France Strategie and a consortium consisting of PSE and Telecom ParisTech.",,13,5,6,4,41,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

First, theoretical propositions indicate that the impact of credit derivative hedging and systematic fluctuation on banking stability in China is derived on the basis of a newly established theoretical model. Then, empirical research based on one-stage and two-stage GMM methods suggests that ascending hedging degrees leads to a linearly improving condition for banking stability with respect to overnight lending swap hedging, an improving-then- worsening condition for compensation swaps and an improving-worsening-improving condition for deposit swap hedging; at the same time, the ascending level of systematic fluctuation associated with hedging improves banking stability. Moreover, the trade-off between loan expansion and the stability maintenance of banking sectors can be managed by hedging compensation swaps and overnight lending swaps. In general, the empirical results support the applicability of the theoretical model, and the hedging of certain swaps can be used as a tool for stability maintenance purposes.","[Chen, Qi-An; Du, Fangzhou] Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Chongqing University,"Chen, QA (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, 174 Shazheng St, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",chenqi_an33@163.com; 963884343@qq.com,,,"Liangjiang Expertise Foundation of Chongqing; Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [CSTC, 2011BB2088]; Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation [71232004]",Liangjiang Expertise Foundation of Chongqing; Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC(Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC); Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation,"This work is supported by the Liangjiang Expertise Foundation of Chongqing, Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC (Grant No. CSTC, 2011BB2088) and the Key Project of the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 71232004).",,38,0,0,0,11,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Furthermore, it seeks to deconstruct the orthodox argument which states the crisis is caused by fiscal indiscipline of some of its members. In doing so, the article bears on the political economy tradition, integrating the elements of hierarchy and asymmetry among the various actors, and poses the hypothesis that the crisis in the Eurozone is due to three highly correlated causes: (1) the unfolding of the 2007 crisis that originated in the United States, (2) the financialization of the global economy, and (3) the intra-Eurozone imbalances, a legacy of the neoliberal institutional framework of the last decades. To associate the Euro crisis with this neoliberal architecture, moreover, the main tendencies of contemporary capitalism are described, pointing to the theoretical contribution of Marx, particularly regarding his hypothesis of a tendential fall of the profit rate. Finally, some concluding remarks are considered, stressing alternatives to the budget austerity measures and to the necessary ruptures with this neoliberal institutional framework.","[de Freitas, Antonio Albano] Fundacao Econ & Estat Rio Grande do Sul, R Duque de Caxias 1691, BR-90010 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,"de Freitas, AA (通讯作者)，Fundacao Econ & Estat Rio Grande do Sul, R Duque de Caxias 1691, BR-90010 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",antonio.freitas@ppge.ie.ufrj.br,,,,,,,52,6,6,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

We also divide ICT capital into hardware and software capital. To our knowledge, this distinction has not been made in any previous study at the industry level. In this case only the estimated elasticity of software is significantly different from zero. Finally, we use the growth accounting framework to compare the contribution from ICT and R&D to value added growth when output elasticities are based on either income shares or weighted least squares (WLS) estimates. The contribution of ICT to value added growth increases from 0.9 to 1.5 percentage points when WLS estimates are used instead of income shares. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

But is this increase accompanied by a similar increase in patent value? To assess this question, we examine the citation lag of Chinese patents as a proxy of patent value in comparison with patents from the US, Europe, Japan, and Korea. Our empirical analysis comprises a unique data set of 60,000 patents with priority years between 2000 and 2010. Utilizing Cox regressions, our results show that Chinese patents suffer from a large citation lag in comparison to international patents, indicating a lower value. This is especially true for patents filed domestically. However, we find empirical support for an increasing patent value in more recent patents. China shows a strong dynamic in the field of patenting and our results suggest that the gap between Chinese patents and international patents might narrow down in the near future.","[Fisch, Christian] Trier Univ, Fac Management, Univ Ring 15, D-54296 Trier, Germany; [Sandner, Philipp] Franfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Regner, Lukas] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, Leopoldstr 139, D-80804 Munich, Germany",Universitat Trier; Technical University of Munich,"Fisch, C (通讯作者)，Trier Univ, Fac Management, Univ Ring 15, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",cfisch@uni-trier.de; p.sandner@fs.de; l.regner@tum.de,"胡, 巧爱/GXZ-8730-2022","Fisch, Christian/0000-0003-3609-7193",,,,,69,42,48,15,126,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Primary data is collected through a random sample of 172 employees in Greece's private and public sectors using two stage cluster sampling. Relying on this sample and the collected variables, we model for the first time a number of qualitative variables as features which represent crisis (especially stress and dissatisfaction but also migration, reprioritizing and behavioral changes). Logistic regressions are then used to present a number of useful contributory functions of stress, dissatisfaction and supportive elements. This provides the basis for calculating the odds ratios and corresponding probability of the effect on employees during the crisis. A number of new findings on the causes of stress emerge including the acceptance of salary reductions, the number of working hours, economic migration, behavioral changes between management and employees, reprioritizing, and minimization of career opportunities.

However, most have focused on emissions at the country level, less attention has been given to emissions at the regional level. To fill the gap, this study firstly utilized a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to analyze the driving forces of aggregate carbon intensity (ACI) of electricity generation in China from 2000 to 2014. A regional attribution analysis was introduced to look into the contributions from 30 provinces to the driving forces. Then, a multi-regional spatial-IDA was further adopted to assess the emission performance of electricity generation in 30 provinces. The results of temporal-IDA and regional attribution analysis show that the ACI in China dropped notably by 14.5% from 2000 to 2014. Thermal efficiency improvement was a major driver for the decrease, due largely to the significant improvement in thermal generation efficiency in the eastern coastal regions. Clean power penetration reduced ACI remarkably as well, of which the western regions were the main contributors. The spatial-IDA results indicate that the emission performance of electricity generation in different regions varied significantly. While the western regions performed better in clean power penetration, the eastern regions performed better in thermal generation efficiency. Based on the findings, several regional policy strategies were recommended to further lower down ACI of electricity in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

There were 18 years of a double-digit export growth, averaging 20.5 percent per year. In 2009, Thailand's exports collapsed after the 2008-09 global financial crisis, but rebounded sharply in the following year. Thailand's exports growth significantly slowed down in 2011 and 2012. From 2013 to 2016, Thailand's exports experienced negative growth. The global recession and China's slowdown contributed to the dismal export performance. There was also a supply factor responsible for the negative growth, however. The dwindling level of foreign direct investment (FDI), caused by Thailand's political turmoil and pessimistic business sentiment, has diminished export capability and competitiveness. The fall of Thailand's export-oriented industries can be attributed to the country's inability to attract FDI inflows. Some industries that are able to secure continuous flows of FDI remain competitive, whereas others that cannot will progressively retreat from the world market.","[Nidhiprabha, Bhanupong] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Nidhiprabha, B (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, 2 Prachan Rd, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",bhanupong@econ.tu.ac.th,,,,,,,12,8,9,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Our results show that the higher capital requirements imposed by Basel I, II and III decrease both the quantity of borrowing and its variability, producing distributional welfare effects among agents: savers are better off, but borrowers and banks are worse off. Then, we propose a macroprudential rule for the countercyclical capital buffer of Basel III in which capital requirements respond to credit growth, output and housing prices. We find that the optimal implementation of Basel III is countercyclical for borrowers and banks, the agents directly affected by capital requirements, while procyclical for savers. From a normative perspective, we see that this macroprudential rule for Basel III delivers higher welfare for the society than a situation with no regulation.

I proxy for economic conditions at the field, of study level, constructed from industry growth rates which I map to fields of study using the average industry - college major distribution. This setup allows controlling for unobserved differences between graduation cohorts such as technological change or shifts in cohort composition. Based on German survey data, I find that a one percentage point increase in field-specific employment growth in the year of graduation raises entry into entrepreneurship by about 30% in the first year after graduation. The effect halves in the second year and is close to zero in the third and fourth years after graduation. Exit from entrepreneurship decreases slightly when economic conditions at graduation improve. Taken together, my results imply that lucky graduation cohorts are persistently more likely to engage in entrepreneurship than recessionary cohorts, at least during the first four years after graduation that I examine.","[Beiler, Hendrik] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Beiler, Hendrik] Univ Cologne, Cologne Grad Sch Management Econ & Social Sci, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Cologne,"Beiler, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.;Beiler, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne Grad Sch Management Econ & Social Sci, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",beiler@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank participants at the EALE conference 2016, participants at the conference The Role of the Firm in the Labor Market organized by DFG SPP 1764, participants in seminars at the IZA Bonn and at the University of Cologne, Susanne Prantl, Dirk Sliwka and the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions.

The impact of uncertain exchange rate fluctuations on trade is evaluated in a partial equilibrium framework, using the concept of risk-aversion elasticities. These elasticities measure how sensitive the firms are towards substituting between return and risk at the margin, with respect to changes in the distribution of the spot exchange rate. This simplest possible analytical framework is useful for explicit empirical estimation of risk-aversion elasticities in the literature of international economics.","[Broll, Udo] Tech Univ Dresden, Sch Int Studies ZIS, Dept Econ & Business, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Mukherjee, Soumyatanu] IIM Kozhikode, Fac Block 1,IIMK Campus,PO Kozhikode, Kozhikode 673570, Kerala, India",Technische Universitat Dresden; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode,"Mukherjee, S (通讯作者)，IIM Kozhikode, Fac Block 1,IIMK Campus,PO Kozhikode, Kozhikode 673570, Kerala, India.",udo.broll@tu-dresden.de; smukherjee@iimk.ac.in,"Mukherjee, Dr Soumyatanu/T-3656-2017","Mukherjee, Dr Soumyatanu/0000-0003-0674-1064",,,,,29,17,18,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper examines the domestic macroeconomic and external factors that have driven India's current account behavior during the 1997-2012 period. Using quarterly data, we apply autoregressive distributed lag and error correction techniques to estimate a model based on the intertemporal approach to the current account. We find evidence in support of the twin deficits hypothesis suggesting that reduction in the fiscal deficit could help to ameliorate the deficit in the current account. Further, we find that contrary to the Feldstein-Horioka hypothesis, domestic saving does respond to increases in domestic investment, and we support efforts to encourage saving in order to simultaneously sustain strong investment and ease the deficit in the current account.

We investigate the impact of this transformation on the wage structure by following jobs that are moved outside the boundary of lead employers to contracting firms. We develop a new method for identifying outsourcing of food, cleaning, security, and logistics services in administrative data using the universe of social security records in Germany. We document a dramatic growth of domestic outsourcing in Germany since the early 1990s. Event-study analyses show that wages in outsourced jobs fall by approximately 10-15% relative to similar jobs that are not outsourced. We find evidence that the wage losses associated with outsourcing stem from a loss of firm-specific rents, suggesting that labor cost savings are an important reason firms choose to contract out these services. Finally, we tie the increase in outsourcing activity to broader changes in the German wage structure, in particular showing that outsourcing of cleaning, security, and logistics services alone accounts for around 9% of the increase in German wage inequality since the 1980s.","[Goldschmidt, Deborah] Anal Grp, Cambridge, MA USA; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; IZA, Cambridge, MA USA; CESIFO, Cambridge, MA USA; CEPR, Cambridge, MA USA",Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Goldschmidt, D (通讯作者)，Anal Grp, Cambridge, MA USA.",,,,W.E.

We also show that there is a positive relationship between the co-movement of the stocks and the benchmark incentives, but that this co-movement is negative with the disagreements, owing to the endogenous risk-sharing mechanisms.

NATURAL RATE; OIL-PRICE SHOCK; INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE; STRUCTURAL BREAKS; HYSTERESIS; SELECTION,"The 2008 economic downturn in the United States resulted in a wave of contractionary effects across many OECD countries. This paper investigates the pattern of the unemployment persistence in the United States and other 28 OECD countries before and after the Great Recession. To detect possible changes in the pattern of unemployment persistence, we employ a mean bias-corrected estimation of the persistence parameter with a rolling window of five years. In addition, we estimate the most likely date of change in the trend function of unemployment to test whether there was any significant change in the pattern of unemployment persistence after the Great Recession. We find significant evidence of a structural break and hysteresis in unemployment rates, with a persistence parameter close to unity, across the United States and other 28 OECD countries. Besides, bootstrap permutation tests show that all half-lives and impulse response functions have significantly changed after the Great Recession. Therefore, our findings call for structural reforms aimed at improving labor market performance, to prevent upward shifts in unemployment across OECD countries from becoming permanent.","[Marques, Andre M.] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Econ, Cidade Univ S-N, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Lima, Gilberto Tadeu] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Troster, Victor] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Ctra Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",Universidade Federal da Paraiba; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Marques, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Econ, Cidade Univ S-N, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.;Troster, V (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Appl Econ, Ctra Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",00094751@ufrgs.br; giltadeu@usp.br; victor.troster@uib.es,"TROSTER, VICTOR/K-5928-2019; Lima, Gilberto Tadeu/E-2731-2013","TROSTER, VICTOR/0000-0002-8798-5601; Lima, Gilberto Tadeu/0000-0002-0307-8298; M.

In 2014 and 2015, petroleum companies faced land use restrictions when the imperiled lesser prairie chicken received threatened species-status under the ESA. In Kansas and Oklahoma, as elsewhere, the petroleum industry has been criticized for damaging environmental quality and developing wildlife habitat. Using data on well locations, I estimate a discrete choice model to measure the effects of ESA regulations on companies' location preferences. While the results show that habitat avoidance increased with regulatory scrutiny, the effect is very modest, which suggests that companies may have discounted the risk of penalties from ESA violations. Results also suggest that pre-listing announcements related to ESA regulations influenced companies' location choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis reveals that exporters which are affiliates of foreign firms charge, on average, lower markups in their export pricing. The markups are decomposed into price and marginal cost components to show that although exporting increases both price and marginal cost, the price increases are small relative to the increases in marginal cost.

An action is said to be belief-free rationalizable if it survives the following iterated deletion process. At each stage, we delete actions for a type of a player that are not a best response to some conjectures of the player. The conjecture has to put positive weight only on states, and types and actions of the other players which that type thinks possible, and actions of those types that have survived so far. We analyze some economic applications under this solution concept. This solution concept characterizes the implications of equilibrium when a player is known to have some private information but may have additional information. It thus answers the informational robustness question of what we can say about the set of outcomes that may arise in equilibrium of a Bayesian game if players may observe some additional information.

We argue that Shiller's work displays a tension between mimetic and anti-mimetic tendencies, i.e. between understanding financial markets as captured by fads and fashions (mimesis), and at the same time understanding such markets on the basis of a notion of homo economicus (an essentially anti-mimetic figure). Identifying that tension not only sheds novel light on Shiller's work, but also allows us to critically discuss Mirowski's negative appraisal of Shiller's behavioural finance programme. Further, we argue that the mimetic/anti-mimetic tension in Shiller's work can equally be identified in a broader range of theories about financial markets, and that attending to it therefore opens up new lines of inquiry beyond behavioural finance.","[Borch, Christian; Lange, Ann-Christina] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Borch, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",cbo.mpp@cbs.dk,,"Borch, Christian/0000-0001-8217-5880",'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research,'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research,This work was supported by a 'Crowd Dynamics in Financial Markets' Sapere Aude Grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research.,,51,3,3,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The comparison is carried out by analysing how the two systems may select the efficient policy in the presence of asymmetric information. Presidential and parliamentary systems differ in that the policy proposed by the executive in the parliamentary system is confidence-dependent and observable. The main findings suggest that the parliament responds better to the incentive scheme in the presidential system due to the lower uncertainty faced by legislators over their term limit.

We take advantage of the fact that wearing a visor a protective device in Ice Hockey is mandatory in European, minor, and junior leagues but not in the NHL. This allows us to estimate the impact of wearing a visor by comparing the behavior in the NHL and other leagues of players who always wear a visor with that of players who wear one only when it is required. We find that when players are forced to wear a visor their behavior becomes more risky, earning an additional 0.19 penalty in minutes per game (compared to the average 1.14 penalty in minutes in our sample). We estimate an even larger effect of visors when we focus on players who were forced to use one during the 2004 season, when the NHL canceled its regular season and players had to move to European leagues temporarily. These estimates are not driven by players' observable attributes, playing style, or other differences across leagues. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our study examines the relationship between the times that classes are offered and the grades that students in these classes earn at a highly selective liberal arts college. Our main findings are that morning classes are harmful for student achievement. Grades are especially lower for classes that were scheduled at 8 am and 9 am.

This paper provides an additional argument demonstrating the non -sufficiency of the Ell namely tax deductions. Building on a theoretical framework which incorporates deductions in a standard optimal-tax model, we show that the ETI is not sufficient for welfare analysis if (i) deductions generate externalities and if (ii) deductions are responsive to tax-rate changes. While the first condition should arguably hold true for the majority of tax deductions, we provide an empirical examination of the second condition. Relying on rich German panel data from administrative tax records, we exploit several tax reforms that were implemented in Germany between 2001 and 2008. Our main estimates indicate an overall ETI between 0:54 and 0.68 and an elasticity of deductions with respect to the net-of-tax rate of about 0.9. These results suggest that the Ell is not sufficient to calculate the welfare cost of taxation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Discount factors reflect time preferences for future cash flows and are used to determine the present value of investment projects such as mergers. Firm-specific discount factors imply that firms may attach different present values to mergers. We elicit firm-specific time preferences and identify firms' discount factors using firm-specific production data while building on the existence of learning-by-doing in the semiconductor industry. Our estimation results show that firm-specific discount factors explain firms' production decisions. We also find that firms' discount factors and merger acquisition strategies explain heterogeneous merger outcomes. Our results show that acquiring firms characterized by low discount factors (impatient firms) are highly efficient and merge with highly efficient and innovative firms. Impatient acquirers achieve relatively higher efficiency gains in the short run than patient acquirers and adopt acquisition strategies that put more weight on achieving instant efficiency gains. In contrast, patient acquirers are least efficient and merge with firms that are larger than themselves. Patient acquirers place more value on achieving efficiency gains in the more distant future.

Employing a panel data program evaluation method devised by Hsiao, Ching, and Wan (2012), we construct hypothetical counterfactuals for per capita real GDP of HSR cities in the absence of their respective HSR projects using the outcomes in selected non-HSR cities. We find that the responses to HSR treatment are heterogeneous with regard to location, route, and region. The location-level impact ranges between 5% and 59% and is not temporary. HSR cities with positive effects concentrate along the Hu-Ning Segment, the Yong-Tai-Wen-Fu-Xia Segment, and within the Hunan province along the Wu-Guang HSR. These cities are mainly located in the eastern coastal regions of China, in core urban agglomeration regions that allow them to be transportation hubs. In general, the gain for local economies is greater for cities that are more industrialized, with more ability of the service sector to absorb enough labor, and with better supporting infrastructure. On the other hand, local protectionism hampers the development of HSR cities. We also show that at different project stages, HSR cities experience different gains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article studies an economy in which an inequality-averse social planner faces agents who have access to a tax-avoidance technology with subadditive costs, and who can shape the risk profile of their income as they see fit. Subadditive avoidance costs imply that optimal taxation cannot be progressive at the top. This in turn may trigger excessive risk-taking. When the avoidance technology consists in costly migration between two countries that compete fiscally, we show that an endogenous increase in inequality due to risk-taking makes progressive taxation more fragile, which vindicates in turn risk-taking and can lead to equilibria with regressive tax rates at the top, and high migrations of wealth towards the smaller country.","[Landier, Augustin] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Plantin, Guillaume] Sci Po, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Landier, A (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,"landier, augustin/AAX-1984-2020","landier, augustin/0000-0001-7928-295X",European Research Council Starting Grant [263673 - RIFIFI]; Scor Chair at the JJ Laffont foundation; European Research Council under the European Community [312503 - SOLSYS],European Research Council Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Scor Chair at the JJ Laffont foundation; European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Marco Ottaviani (the editor), five anonymous referees, Daron Acemoglu, Bruno Biais, Patrick Bolton, Philippe De Donder, Christian Hellwig, Thomas Mariotti, Thomas Piketty, Sven Rady, Sylvia Serfaty, Konrad Stahl, and seminar participants at Gerzensee (ESSET), Ecole Polytechnique, London School of Economics, Stockholm School of Economics, and Toulouse School of Economics for very helpful comments.

As the extensive mode of economic growth has caused many problems in China, it is necessary to find other ways to promote the development of poor areas to narrow regional disparities in the country. This paper measures the equalization of public services and residents' living standards in China, based on a provincial panel data for the period 2001-2013, to analyze the impact of the equalization of public services on China's regional disparities. The empirical results, based on spatial econometrics models, show that the equalization of all types of public services can promote the regional equality of incomes and consumptions.

We model a CPR in which uncertainty simultaneously creates a Prisoner's Dilemma and a Coordination Game. This model highlights a novel mechanism through which uncertainty incentivizes the overuse of a CPR. In the model, two Nash Equilibria exist, both of which lead to a Tragedy of the Commons, but one is an inferior solution because it leads to assured resource destruction. We use a single-period laboratory experiment to investigate the effects of uncertain tipping points on constituents' resource extraction decisions. Experimental results suggest that uncertainty reduces coordination in this type of CPR setting and increases the likelihood of resource destruction.

The study uses the data obtained from the Prowess database, provided by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), covering the period 1991-2010. The study explores the growth of Indian manufacturing firms with respect to 1) its cross-sectional distribution, 2) its dynamics over time, and 3) its determinants. The cross-sectional distributional analysis exhibits high levels of heterogeneity in firm growth patterns, even across firms operating within the same sector, which increases over time. The inter-temporal dynamics observed with the help of transition probabilities matrices suggests that firm growth rates are not highly persistent in time, which is in contrast with the evidence from developed countries. It also reveals the coexistence of firms with very different characteristics and performance within sectors. Given the wide heterogeneity and non-persistent behavior of firm growth rates, this paper resorts to quantile regression analysis to identify the differential effect of regressors at different deciles of the conditional distribution.","[Mathew, Nanditha] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Mathew, Nanditha] IBIMET CNR, Via Giovanni Caproni 8, I-50145 Florence, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR),"Mathew, N (通讯作者)，St Anna Sch Adv Studies, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.;Mathew, N (通讯作者)，IBIMET CNR, Via Giovanni Caproni 8, I-50145 Florence, Italy.",nandithamathew@gmail.com,,"Mathew, Nanditha/0000-0002-2781-8115",IBIMET-CNR (grant CrisisLab-ProCoPe),IBIMET-CNR (grant CrisisLab-ProCoPe),I gratefully acknowledge the research support by the IBIMET-CNR (grant CrisisLab-ProCoPe).

This paper aims to integrate these divergent empirical results into a unified theoretical framework by introducing scale economies into the classical model of Becker and Lewis (1973). As a result, the anomaly of an observed upward or an inverted U-shaped relationship can be expected as the scale economies effect dominates when there are few children in a family. Using data from the China's 1990 and 2000 censuses, this study further tests some hypotheses induced from the model. Educational attainment increases with sibling size at first and then drops. Children with one or two siblings achieve the highest education during the period our sample covers. The inverted U-shaped correlation is more robust for rural subsamples, for older cohorts and for economically underdeveloped regions and groups, which is consistent with the prediction of the model.

However, its effects on firm survival have been largely neglected in previous research. Using annual data of Chinese manufacturing firms over the period 1998-2008, we analyze the link between property rights security and firms' survival probabilities, differentiating firms into stated-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-SOEs, and considering whether the linkage evolves over time. Examining a wide range of specifications, we find that the protection of property rights, by limiting government intervention and promulgating laws and rules, is crucial for firm survival. Moreover, better security of property rights benefits non-SOEs more. We also find that the beneficial effects of secure property rights on firm survival are more pronounced for years after 2003 when China speeded up deregulation to comply with its WTO commitments and reform target to establish a modern system of property rights than for years before 2002.","[Zhang, Qiong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Room 422A Qiushi Bldg,59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yupeng] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Room 1306 Main Bldg,39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [He, Angda] World Bank Grp, Int Finance Corp, 2121 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Wen, Xueting] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Room 123 Weilun Bldg,1 Tsinghua Pk, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance & Economics; The World Bank; Tsinghua University,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Room 422A Qiushi Bldg,59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",zhangqiong8@ruc.edu.ai; shiyupeng@cufe.edu.cn; heangda@hotmail.com; wenxt.11@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Natural Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDB120]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71573291]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [14JZD019],"Natural Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China)","We are grateful to the Natural Social Science Foundation of China research fund (with grant number 14ZDB120), the Natural Science Foundation of China research fund (with grant number 71573291) and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China research funds (with grant number 14JZD019) for financial support.

An error correction model (ECM) and an alternative model to deal with the possible endogeneity problem are utilized. This paper shows that fiscal policy in Indonesia tends to be procyclical.

We study how recent bans on phosphate in household dishwasher detergent affect pollution loads to waterways, costs at wastewater treatment facilities, and consumer behavior. We show that the effectiveness of the bans in reducing effluent depends critically on regulations at receiving treatment facilities. As cost minimizers, facilities with an emissions standard on phosphorus face no incentive to deviate from the standard. We show that bans have weak effects on effluent, especially in the most polluted waterways. We also use an early, isolated ban in Spokane, Washington to study the effect of the bans on consumers. We find that this ban shifted approximately 40% of dishwasher detergent sales from Spokane to bordering counties until a state-wide ban was implemented. Using these estimates, we find that the welfare loss to consumers from recent bans is likely greater than the cost-savings to treatment plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using pooled cross-section data for 1995 and 2002, the results indicate that the decisions for migration and the choice of employment are related, suggesting that estimating employment choices without considering migration status leads to biased estimates. We find that both higher paid wages and broader pension benefits are major determinants of employment choice.

Several papers have addressed this issue with different model mechanisms, which can essentially be divided into three categories: financial frictions (on the production side or on the household side), stickiness in the price of productive inputs (labor or intermediate goods), and non-separable preferences between labor and composite consumption. While each mechanism can independently resolve the comovement problem, it is unclear which mechanism is empirically most relevant. This paper conducts a horse race among three alternatives that can resolve the puzzle in isolation, namely, a working capital channel with habit formation, sticky wages, and non separable preferences, using a Bayesian approach. Based on the posterior estimates and a log marginal likelihood comparison exercise, the working capital channel combined with habit formation is the most important mechanism, as it can simultaneously resolve the comovement problem and fit the data well.

Probability models of self-employment using both pooled-panel probit and dynamic random-effects panel probit methods are estimated, and the results are found to be extremely sensitive to the differences in the econometric methods. Once unobserved heterogeneity and initial conditions are controlled for in the dynamic model, the importance of observed characteristics in determining self-employment is greatly diminished. Instead, workers' past experience in self-employment ( as opposed to salaried employment) is found to have a large favourable effect on their future self-employment prospects. The influence of this state dependence is also considerably more important in determining self-employment outcomes than salaried ones. Despite establishing the importance of state dependence, however, what this effect implies about why individuals choose to become self-employed or the role that self-employment plays in the labour market remains unresolved.","[Fitzpatrick, Darcy] Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Fitzpatrick, D (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia.",darcy.fitzpatrick@flinders.edu.au,,,Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

Two of these methods involve a fixed number of repetitions with payoff discounting, followed by random termination [proposed by Sabater-Grande and Georgantzis (J Econ Behav Organ 48:37-50, 2002)] or followed by a coordination game [proposed in (Andersson and Wengstrom in J Econ Behav Organ 81:207-219, 2012; Cooper and Kuhn in Am Econ J Microecon 6:247-278, 2014a)]. We also propose a new method-block random termination-in which subjects receive feedback about termination in blocks of rounds. We find that behavior is consistent with the presence of dynamic incentives only with methods using random termination, with the standard method generating the highest level of cooperation. Subject behavior in the other two methods display two features: a higher level of stability in cooperation rates and less dependence on past experience. Estimates of the strategies used by subjects reveal that across implementations, even when the discount rate is the same, if interactions are expected to be longer defection increases and the use of the Grim strategy decreases.","[Frechette, Guillaume R.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Yuksel, Sevgi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",New York University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Fréchette, GR (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",frechette@nyu.edu,,,"NSF [SES-0924780, SES-1225779, SES-1558857]; CESS; C.V.

Our research indicated socio-economic factors (among others: poviats budget income, feminisation rate, unemployment rate), which, with varying force and in varying directions, affected the studied variable in specific parts of the country. The analyses were performed on the basis of statistical data on the numbers of de-registrations for residence abroad in Poland's NUTS-4 in three economic age groups (pre-working, working, and post-working age) for the time span from 2005 to 2013.","[Lewandowska-Gwarda, Karolina; Antczak, Elzbieta] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Lewandowska-Gwarda, K (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland.",lewandowska@uni.lodz.pl; wiszniewska@uni.lodz.pl,"Antczak, Elżbieta/K-4872-2019; Antczak, Elżbieta/K-3623-2019; Lewandowska-Gwarda, Karolina/I-3711-2019","Antczak, Elżbieta/0000-0002-9695-6300; Lewandowska-Gwarda, Karolina/0000-0001-9868-0689",,,,,46,2,2,1,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

It is shown using a New Keynesian framework that the severity of the indeterminacy problem that arises under each tax system depends not only on the specification of the interest-rate feedback rule, but also on the magnitude of the steady state tax rate, the steady state government debt-output ratio, and the degree of price stickiness. Significant differences in the determinacy criteria across the two tax systems are found to exist. The robustness of the results is assessed by extending the baseline model to include capital accumulation and the taxation of bond interest income. From a policy perspective, our results suggest that future shifts toward indirect taxation could have nontrivial implications for the setting of monetary policy under balanced budget rules, in particular the ability of the Taylor principle to achieve determinacy.","[McKnight, Stephen] Colegio Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"McKnight, S (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",mcknight@colmex.mx,"McKnight, Stephen/AAH-1560-2020","McKnight, Stephen/0000-0003-0669-1511",,,,,39,1,1,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We develop a simple two-period model of efficiency wages that rationalizes recent empirical findings suggesting PRP flattens the pay-tenure profile. Such attenuation has important implications for the credibility of long-term employment contracts as it suggests that agency rather than human capital considerations drive the profile.","[Sessions, John G.] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England; [Skatun, John D.] Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Bath; University of Aberdeen,"Sessions, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England.",,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

I argue that by distinguishing between two different historical episodes after World War II, the Golden Age and the Age of Decline, some insights in the Phillips curve puzzle can be gained and the analysis helps us to substantiate the existence of both downward sloping and upward sloping species of the curve. The regime change is illustrated here by building on a commonly used Post-Keynesian model of distribution and growth, which is enhanced to allow for an inflation process based on a conflicting claims approach and a growth rate form of Okun's law. The model shows that the long-run Phillips curve can be either downward-sloping or upward-sloping, conditioned to the distribution of market power between business and labor.","[Vera, Leonardo] Univ Cent Venezuela, Sch Econ, FACES, Caracas, Venezuela",University of Central Venezuela,"Vera, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Venezuela, Sch Econ, Ciudad Univ, Caracas 1051, Venezuela.",Leonardo.vera@cantv.net,,,,,,,36,2,2,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The main result establishes a tight connection between the set of equilibrium absorbing points and the von Neumann-Morgenstern solutions: assuming that players are patient, that the voting rule is oligarchical, and that there is at least one veto player with positive recognition probability, a set of alternatives corresponds to the absorbing points of an equilibrium if and only if it is a von Neumann-Morgenstern solution. We also apply our analysis of ergodic properties of equilibria to the persistent agenda setter environment of Diermeier and Fong (2012). We show that all equilibria are essentially pure, and we extend their characterization of absorbing sets to allow an arbitrary voting rule and by removing the restriction to pure strategy equilibria.

MNEs' advantages lie in firm specific synergies and access to internal capital markets, whereas PE-firms are good at reorganizing target firms. We show that stronger firm-specific synergies, lower restructuring advantages for PE-firms, higher exit costs for PE-firms, better access to internal capital markets, a higher risk premium on lending, higher moral hazard problems, and higher trade costs all favor MNEs over PE-firms.

We propose both a tractable behavioral model as well as axioms applied to the behavior of the collection of players, focusing first on prisoners' dilemma games. A representation theorem establishes these axioms as the precise behavioral content of the model, and that the model's parameters are (essentially) uniquely identified from behavior. The behavioral model features magical thinking: players behave as if their expectations about their opponents' behavior vary with their own choices. The model provides a unified view of documented behavior in a range of often studied games, such as the prisoners' dilemma, the battle of the sexes, hawk-dove, and the stag hunt, and also generates novel predictions across games.","[Daley, Brendan] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Sadowski, Philipp] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Daley, B (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",bd28@duke.edu; p.sadowski@duke.edu,,,NSF [SES 1461502],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Earlier working versions circulated under the titles Foundations for cooperation in the prisoners' dilemma and A strategic model of magical thinking: Axioms and analysis.

The underlying conjecture is that extreme opinions are associated to overreactions in the perception of wealth. The analysis covers 34 countries from 1988 through 2013. In a novel approach, views regarding economic performance are approximated using content in the global economic press. Consistent with the overreaction conjecture, stock market indices are shown to under-perform following extreme optimistic views and over-perform after pessimistic views. A long-short contrarian portfolio earns 11% annually over the next five years.

We study the distributional effects of trade policy in a neoclassical Heckscher-Ohlin economy with not just two, but many input factors in production. We demonstrate that the factor price changes induced by trade policy are negatively associated with the factor content of free trade (and therefore factor abundance). Using large-scale international survey data, we test whether these predicted distributional effects are reflected in the trade policy preferences of workers with different labor market skills. In order to isolate the effects of factor abundance from other skill-related confounding factors, we employ a within-skill-group estimator that exploits the cross-country variation in factor abundance. In line with theory, the data show that individuals whose skills are in more abundant domestic supply have significantly more positive attitudes towards trade. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Entrepreneurs look to expand, make new investments, or pay off debt using free cash flows from the business. However, entrepreneurs in farming businesses derive income from enterprises that have variable income, and farm program payments provided by the government helps smooth income and consumption. Using national-farm level data (2008-2013) and free cash modelling approach we study how government commodity support (decoupled, coupled payments and subsidized crop insurance) affects the financial status of farm businesses. Additionally, we investigate the impact of government commodity support on farming business and household expenditures. Findings suggest that free cash flows to equity has a significantly negative impact on total farm household expenditures. Further, our results also suggest that the effect of farm program payments, especially decoupled payments, is small. Elasticities on the decoupled Payments and coupled Payments variables are both positive. However, the magnitude of the effect on the former is four times higher than on the latter. Hence, most of the impact of Title I support on total farm household expenditures will likely be via the decoupled Payments channel. Nonetheless, if the goal of commodity support is to reduce the consumption volatility of farm household, our results suggest that these payments have little impact.

Members of the opposition are heterogeneous in income and ideology, and heterogeneity generates disagreement about whether to accept the government's offer. We assume that the probability that the government's offer will preclude conflict increases continuously with the number of opposition group members who agree to accept it. When within-group heterogeneity is large, the number of members who are receptive to the government's offer is less responsive to an increase in the transfer level. In this situation, the government must substantially increase its transfer to attract the support of the opposition.

These countries continue to maintain significant levels of fuel subsidies, with Iran and Saudi Arabia being the largest contributors to CO2 emissions. This paper illustrates that fuel price policy reforms by these counties would be an important instrument for both climate and economic policies. We estimate that a reduction in subsidies to both gasoline and diesel by about 20 US$ cents per liter will lead to significant decreases in CO2 emissions, both in the MENA region and globally. In Iran, for example, the reductions could be up to 90% and 50% of current emissions generated from diesel and gasoline consumption, respectively, and for Saudi Arabia, approximately 70% and 40%, respectively.

Both advances refine the approach of implementing residual load duration curves (RLDCs) to capture integration challenges. In this paper we derive RLDCs for eight world regions (based on region-specific time series for load, wind and solar) and implement them into the REMIND model. Therein we parameterize the impact of short-term storage using the highly-resolved model DIMES. All RLDCs and the underlying region-specific VRE time series are made available to the research community. We find that the more accurate accounting of integration challenges in REMIND does not reduce the prominent role of wind and solar in scenarios that cost-efficiently achieve the 2 degrees C target. Until 2030, VRE shares increase to about 15-40% in most regions with limited deployment of short-term storage capacities (below 2% of peak load). The REMIND model's default assumption of large-scale transmission grid expansion allows smoothening variability such that VRE capacity credits are moderate and curtailment is low. In the long run, VRE become the backbone of electricity supply and provide more than 70% of global electricity demand from 2070 on. Integration options ease this transformation: storage on diurnal and seasonal scales (via flow batteries and hydrogen electrolysis) and a shift in the non-VRE capacity mix from baseload towards more peaking power plants. The refined RLDC approach allows for a more accurate consideration of system-level impacts of VRE, and hence more robust insights on the nature of power sector decarbonization and related economic impacts.

The US state has practised production-focused industrial policy from the early years of the republic, with benefits that by any plausible measure far exceed costs. But since the 1980s, the exchange-focused idea that 'the free market is what works, and having the state help it is usually a contradiction in terms' has been at the normative centre of gravity in public policy discourse. With 'industrial policy' rendered toxic, the state has disguised its production-focused practice, to the point where even non-ideological academic researchers claim that the USA does industrial policy not at all, or badly. This essay reviews the history of US industrial policy, with an emphasis on 'network-building industrial policy' over the past two decades. At the end, it draws a lesson for policy communities in other countries and interstate development organisations such as the World Bank and IMF.","[Wade, Robert H.] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wade, RH (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",r.wade@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,29,33,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper uses a slack-based measure to estimate the total factor environmental efficiency (TFEE) of 286 Chinese prefectural-and-above cities for the period 2002-2013. In particular, the relationship between city size and TFEE is investigated. The findings also show an inverted U-shaped relationship between TFEE and city size, which implies an optimal city size of 16.68 million residents in China. According to this estimate, most Chinese cities may be undersized due to the migration restrictions of the hukou registration system and, hence, suffer from great environmental efficiency losses. The estimated low average TFEE value of Chinese cities also suggests the large potential for efficiency improvement. Thus, government policies should focus on relaxing migration restrictions and encouraging the development of large cities.","[Wu, Jianxin] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Inst Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Wang, Bing] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; University of Western Australia; Jinan University,"Wu, YR (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",twujianxin@jnu.edu.cn; yanrui.wu@uwa.edu.au; twangb@jnu.edu.cn,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",,,,,49,7,10,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2017,25.0,3,,,,,60,86,,10.1111/cwe.12200,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EY9UH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404343600003,0

I find that social insurance (modeled as the combination of a minimum consumption floor and the Medicaid program) does not only distort saving and labor supply decisions, but also has a large crowding out effect on the demand for private health insurance. However, despite the distorting effects, the net welfare consequence of eliminating social insurance is still negative in most cases. In addition, the large crowding out effect on private health insurance suggests that the existence of social insurance programs may be one reason why some Americans do not buy any health insurance.

The methodological setting benefits from the most recent developments that recommend the consideration of structural changes in both the mean and variance and asymmetric reactions of volatility to positive and negative shocks. The results document structural changes and significant reductions of GDP growth rates volatility consistent with the Great Moderation phenomenon and reveal that the impact of negative shocks on volatility exceeds that of positive shocks more than 4 times over the sample period. Moreover, these asymmetries follow a rather stable pattern over the sample period, suggesting that the Portuguese economy has not been able to reduce its growth vulnerability to cyclical fluctuations.","[Andraz, Jorge M.; Norte, Nelia M.] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas,Edificio 9, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Andraz, Jorge M.; Norte, Nelia M.] Univ Aevora, CEFAGE UE Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Evora, Portugal; [Andraz, Jorge M.] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas,Edificio 9, P-8005496 Faro, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve,"Andraz, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas,Edificio 9, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.;Andraz, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Aevora, CEFAGE UE Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Evora, Portugal.;Andraz, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas,Edificio 9, P-8005496 Faro, Portugal.",jandraz@ualg.pt; nnorte@ualg.pt,,,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013]; FEDER/COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors are pleased to acknowledge financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (grant UID/ECO/04007/2013) and FEDER/COMPETE (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659).

Our findings suggest that reported FDI spillover estimates are affected by publication bias. In combination with model misspecification of the primary studies, the bias overstates the genuine underlying meta-effect, but the meta-effect remains economically and statistically significant. Our results emphasize that spillovers and their sign largely depend systematically on specification characteristics of the primary studies and publication bias. Publication bias is not caused by best practice choices.

With lobbying also at the central level, equalization is distorted downward on all tax bases if the pressure groups are similar in terms of lobbying power.

We derive several conclusions: (i) We show that regional housing cycle dissimilarities are significantly and strongly connected to geography. (ii) After the burst of the recent housing bubble there was greater significant co-movement in shorter cycles for a short period of time. (iii) Coastal regions, which have a higher house price volatility compared to other MSAs are also those with a higher degree of house supply regulation.

When the odds of winning a contest are exogenously given - we show that if either the players discount the future or if the total cost of contest is smaller in the future - there exist subgame perfect equilibria where both players settle, anticipating a contest in the future. With endogenous efforts, the aggregate efforts expanded in a contest are smaller if the contest occurs in the future when the relative effort productivities remain constant or diverge over time, thus creating scope for delay in contests. When the effort productivities converge over time, the total efforts may be greater under a future contest.

This is an essential topic for firms as management control systems (MCS) are used to make sure subordinates behave in function of the goals of the firm. Family firms, however, have distinct features, such as differences in governance structures and goals, which can have a significant impact on whether and how MCS are used.

This is likely to have significant impact on the labor-intensive agriculture. However, the fast growing of machinery service has provided farmers an opportunity to out-source field work that demands heavy labor inputs. Therefore, the demographic change and development of machinery service may jointly influence farmers' production decision in terms of crop choice and inputs. Household data of Fixed Point Rural Survey (FPRS) are used to examine the potential change in farmers' decisions on crop mix and input uses. It is found out that, under current situations, aging may impact agriculture through changing crop mix, and the choice is largely determined by access to service of farm machine; which, in turn, is likely to be determined by topography.

The seller is privately informed on his persistent cost, while the buyer remains uninformed. Public enforcement relies on remedies for breaches. Private enforcement comes from terminating the relationship. We first characterize enforcement constraints under asymmetric information. Those constraints ensure that parties never breach contracts. In particular, a high-cost seller may be tempted to trade high volumes at high prices at the beginning of the relationship before breaching the contract later on. Such take-the-money-and-run strategy becomes less attractive as time passes. It can thus be prevented by backloading payments and increasing volumes over a transitory phase. In a mature phase, enforcement constraints are slack and the optimal contract, although keeping memory of the shadow cost of enforcement constraints binding earlier on, looks stationary. Second-best distortions depend on a modified virtual cost that encapsulates this shadow cost of enforcement.","[Martimort, David] EHESS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Semenov, Aggey] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Stole, Lars] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Paris School of Economics; University of Ottawa; University of Chicago,"Martimort, D (通讯作者)，EHESS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",,"Semenov, Aggey/M-7245-2019",,ANR Polycripe; Program Investissements d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-93-01],ANR Polycripe(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Program Investissements d'Avenir of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"For helpful comments on earlier versions of this work, we thank seminar and conference participants at the Canadian Economic Theory 2011 Meeting in Toronto, the Canadian Economic Association 2012 in Calgary, the 2013 Workshop on Conflict and Cooperation in Bergamo, the 2013 conference on Contracts, Procurement, and Public-Private Arrangements in Florence, Sciences Po in Paris, The 2013 IO Workshop in Berlin, REST-ENSAE in Paris, RECODE in Ottawa, the First Brazilian Conference Series on Public Procurement and Concession Design in Sao Paulo, the 2014 Workshop on Public Procurement in Mannheim, Oslo University, the 2014 Latin-American Econometric Society Meeting in Rio de Janeiro, and 2015 Workshop on Law Enforcement in Nanterre, France.

We prove existence of a unique Nash equilibrium which is characterized by policy convergence or divergence depending on whether candidates redistribution technologies are symmetric or not. Perhaps more importantly, we show that, independently of whether the equilibrium is convergent or divergent, there are three predominant effects on equilibrium tax rates: the group-size effect (the larger an income group, the larger its influence on equilibrium tax rate), the income effect (poor voters are more responsive to a redistributive transfer) and the within-group homogeneity effect (the degree to which voters of the same income group have similar non-economic characteristics).

J,"Pastén, R",,,,"Pasten, Roberto",,,The political economy of the fiscal deficit in nineteenth-century Chile,CEPAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal policy; budget deficits; national budgets; economic history; Chile,,"A structural shift in the trend toward higher deficits had emerged by the middle of the 1860s in Chile. For some authors, this was the result of increased spending owing to a fast-growing economy. Another common explanation is the higher spending required to finance and then recover from the war against Spain, which began in 1864. This article provides an alternative explanation for the country's fiscal disarray during that period, suggesting that it was motivated largely by increased political turmoil at the beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century in Chile that ended with the ousting of President Balmaceda in 1891. That period represents a dramatic departure from the calmer and economically buoyant early years of the Republic. Thus, it is suggested that the beginning of President Jose Joaquin Perez's rule in 1861 marks both a major political realignment after the birth of the Republic and a structural shift in the trend toward higher deficits. This hypothesis is consistent with the idea that political instability tends to lead to a decoupling of taxes from spending, two elements which would be otherwise aligned as predicted by the tax smoothing theory. This essay is a factual description in support of this hypothesis.","[Pasten, Roberto] Univ Austral Chile, Econ Inst, Valdivia, Chile",Universidad Austral de Chile,"Pastén, R (通讯作者)，Univ Austral Chile, Econ Inst, Valdivia, Chile.",roberto.pasten@uach.cl,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2017,,121,,,,,157,170,,,,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FE9AI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408496200009,0

The results show that their strategic choice of marketing objective is correlated with market reservation price (MRP) when the strength of the INE is low. When the MRP is low, the retailers tend to adopt a strategy of profit maximization. As MRP increases, low-cost retailers adopt a strategy of revenue maximization instead of profit maximization to maximize revenue at an earlier stage than high-cost retailers. However, when the strength of the INE is high, retailers only choose a strategy of revenue maximization as their marketing objective. The probability that a retailer uses a revenue maximization strategy increases as the strength of the INE grows, and product complementarity increases, when there is an equilibrium between two pure marketing objective strategies. An optimal preference ratio for retailers may exist when the strength of INE is found to be not large enough. Numerical examples reveal that the degree of preference of retailers to maximize profit is shown to be negatively correlated with both INE and product complementarity. On the other hand, their profits are positively correlated with both of these factors.","[Yi, Yuyin; Yang, Haishen] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haishen] Guangdong Acad Social Sci, Guangzhou 510635, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Yi, YI (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yiyuyin2001@sina.com; hessen_yang@qq.com,"yang, hessen/AAE-5922-2019",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571086]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2014A030313391],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),We thank Professor Sushanta Mallick and the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments that lead to the substantial improvement of this paper.

The focus is on dowries in India, which increase the economic returns to sons and decrease the returns to daughters. The paper exploits an exogenous shift in the cost of girls relative to boys arising from a revision in anti-dowry law, which is shown to have decreased dowry transfers markedly. The reform is found to have attenuated the widely documented positive association between daughters and their parents' fertility. The effect is particularly pronounced for more autonomous women and for individuals living in areas characterised by strong preferences for sons.","[Alfano, Marco] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England; [Alfano, Marco] Ctr Res & Anal Migrat CReAM, London WC1H 0AX, England",University of Strathclyde,"Alfano, M (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England.;Alfano, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Res & Anal Migrat CReAM, London WC1H 0AX, England.",marco.alfano@strath.ac.uk,,"Alfano, Marco/0000-0001-5491-2054",British Academy and the Norface Research Programme on Migration,British Academy and the Norface Research Programme on Migration,"For helpful comments, I would like to thank Wiji Arulampalam, Golnaz Badkobeh, Sonia Bhalotra, Thomas Cornelissen, Christian Dustmann, Werner Menski, Luigi Minale, Robin Naylor, Anna Okatenko, Sarmistha Pal, Imran Rasul, Uta Schonberg, Jeremy Smith, Jan Stuhler and two anonymous referees and seminar participants at the Conference on Economics Aspects of Public Policy, CReAM, SALE, ESPE, IIES, NISER, SSEES, University of Essex and XII Brucchi Luchino Workshop.

The literature has adopted different approaches to address this issue, however, risk preferences are not uniquely identified by the most popular methods; decision error is not predicted to monotonically decrease with risk aversion. This paper reports the results of an experiment that elicits risk preferences to identify risk averse individuals and evaluates the frequency the stochastically dominant of two lotteries is chosen. Risk averse subjects exhibit a strong preference for dominant lotteries. More importantly, violations are consistent with stochastic decision error that decreases with risk aversion.","[Bruner, David M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, 3106 Peacock Hall, Boone, NC 28607 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Bruner, DM (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, 3106 Peacock Hall, Boone, NC 28607 USA.",brunerdm@appstate.edu,,,,,,,41,4,4,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We then design optimal fiscal and monetary policy within a large state-space LQ-tracking wavelet decomposition model. Our study builds a MATLAB program that simulates optimal policy thrusts at each frequency range where: (1) both fiscal and monetary policy are emphasized, (2) only fiscal policy is relatively active, and (3) when only monetary policy is relatively active. The results show that the monetary authorities should utilize a strategy that in uences the short-term market interest rate to undulate based on the cyclical wavelet decomposition in order to compute the optimal timing and levels for the aggregate interest rate adjustments. Given that central bank rates are adjusted in discrete steps, this implies that central bank monetary policy adjustments will be sub-optimal. We also find that modest emphasis on active interest rate movements can alleviate much of the volatility in optimal government spending, while rendering similarly favorable levels of aggregate consumption and investment. This research is the first to construct joint fiscal and monetary policies in an applied optimal control model based on the short and long cyclical lag structures obtained from wavelet analysis.

The main result establishes existence of equilibrium under compactness and continuity conditions, without the structure of convexity or strict comprehensiveness used in the extant literature.

Quantitative overeducation addresses a firm's decision, to train more employees than needed. One explanation for this decision is modeled in this article that of classical bargaining power. The main idea is that after investing in human capital the employer uses employees outside the firm to raise the bargaining power when he negotiates with the employees within the firm on how to share the profit of the firm. To model this, we use cooperative game theory for the first time. The labor market is modeled by a coalition structure and the payoffs are determined by the chi value (Casajus, 2009).

Prudent use of antibiotics is vital to delay the spread of resistance. In this study I use a randomized controlled trial to test the effect on antibiotics use of reminders to primary care patients. The intervention was implemented across 31 clinics during the flu season in Stockholm. A two-level randomization was used, with randomization at clinic level as well as at individual patient level. With reminders antibiotics use fell by 12.6 per cent relative to the control clinics. The effect is at clinic level, suggesting that doctors or doctor patient interactions, not individual patients, are affected. Results from a follow-up experiment further suggest that an effect on the interactions between doctor and patient is the primary driver of the main results. Behavioural interventions targeting these interactions have the potential to reduce antibiotics use. More research is needed, though, as monitoring and adherence may also play a role.

Vertical externalities, i.e. spillovers between local and central government, could however undo part of this advantage. In this paper we estimate spillovers from Social Assistance (SA), administered by municipalities, towards central government's Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) scheme in The Netherlands. The latter scheme saw rapidly rising enrolment rates after financial responsibility for Social Assistance was transferred from central to local government. We find that the correlation between local SSDI enrolment and the local stock of SA benefits recipients has increased significantly in the years after decentralization. We show that an increased caseload shifting from Social Assistance to Disability Insurance is the only plausible explanation for this change. Our analysis shows that, following the decentralization of Social Assistance, at least one third of the SSDI inflow was diverted from SA. This caseload shifting increased more rapidly in municipalities experiencing deficits on their SA budgets than in municipalities running a surplus.","[Roelofs, Gijs; van Vuuren, Daniel] CPB, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Roelofs, Gijs] Minist Social Affairs & Employment, POB 90801, NL-2509 LV The Hague, Netherlands; [van Vuuren, Daniel] Netspar, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",,"Roelofs, G (通讯作者)，CPB, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.;Roelofs, G (通讯作者)，Minist Social Affairs & Employment, POB 90801, NL-2509 LV The Hague, Netherlands.",groelofs@minszw.nl; d.j.van.vuuren@cpb.nl,,"van Vuuren, Daniel/0000-0002-9972-1873",,,,,26,2,2,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2017,165.0,1,,,,,1,21,,10.1007/s10645-017-9289-4,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EM0JF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395003900001,0

They are used as a support for new representative claims. At the same time, they feed conflicts within national administration. Firstly, several professional organisations claim to stand up for a << small-scale capitalist agriculture >> , located between small plots dedicated to consumption on the farm and huge operators who export a large amount of their crops. They use the concept of << semi-subsistence >> as a means to make a clear distinction between farms that deserve support and those that are doomed to disappear. Statistical tools and rhetorical devices used to make a selection are not sufficient to bring out new economic practices. But they give a sense of purpose to self-appointed spokespersons. Second, several Divisions compete against each over within the Romanian Department of Agriculture and Rural development. As they struggle to delineate their respective scope for action, some of them call upon professional organisations that claim to support << small-scale capitalist agriculture >>. High-ranking officials who look for such reinforcements attempt to legitimate their position, arguing that they are backed by a strong external mobilisation. The analysis is based on a systematic examination of appropriate trade journals and on semi-structured interviews with leaders of professional organisations and heads of administrative Divisions.","[Roger, Antoine] Inst Etud Polit Bordeaux, Polit Sci, Bordeaux, France; [Roger, Antoine] Ctr Emile Durkheim, UMR 5116, Bordeaux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Roger, A (通讯作者)，Inst Etud Polit Bordeaux, Polit Sci, Bordeaux, France.;Roger, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Emile Durkheim, UMR 5116, Bordeaux, France.",a.roger@sciencespobordeaux.fr,,,,,,,49,1,1,0,3,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Taken together, the pictures show how 20 years of research have improved our ability to undertake our professional responsibilities.

It will also need to consider the trade-off between fine-tuning and simplicity in any new immigration system, facing a choice between the ability to tailor immigration policy to government objectives outside of immigration, and the potential benefits of maintaining a simpler, more uniform, and easily enforceable set of rules that apply to workers and employers across the board.","[Sumption, Madeleine] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Sumption, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",madeleine.sumption@compas.ox.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/R000824/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,23,12,12,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Particular attention is given to the influence of taxation. The concept of user cost relates to the rental, the rate of return to capital, that arises in a profit maximizing situation in which further investment in capital produces no additional profit. This paper sets out in some detail the range of assumptions involved in obtaining alternative expressions for the user cost. The user cost refers to a before-tax capital rental, the rate of return that ensures that the (after-tax) cost of capital is equal to the post-tax returns over its life. Hence, associated with the user cost measure is an effective marginal tax rate. This can differ substantially from the statutory marginal rate applicable to the investor. A related effective average tax rate is also defined.","[Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gemmell, Norman] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand.",john.creedy@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,28,4,4,2,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The answer is given in a novel analytical framework that allows for population aging to affect endogenous capital- and labor-saving technical change. In a steady state capital-saving technical progress vanishes, and the economy's growth rate of per-capita variables reflects only labor-saving technical change. The mere possibility of capital-saving technical change is shown to imply that the economy's steady-state growth rate becomes independent of its age structure: Neither a higher life expectancy nor a decline in fertility affects economic growth in the long run.","[Irmen, Andreas] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Irmen, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Luxembourg; Ifo Institut,"Irmen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Fac Law Econ & Finance, 162a Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",airmen@uni.lu,,"Irmen, Andreas/0000-0003-0410-8855",University of Luxembourg under the program Agecon C-Population Aging: An Exploration of Its Effect on Economic Performance and Culture,University of Luxembourg under the program Agecon C-Population Aging: An Exploration of Its Effect on Economic Performance and Culture,"This article is a revised version of my CREA Discussion Paper (Irmen, 2013a).

First, the tax rates adopted by different countries are generally uncorrelated with their growth performance. Second, countries that drastically reduce private incentives to invest severely hurt their growth performance. In our model, the effects of taxation on growth are highly nonlinear. Low tax rates have a very small impact on long-run growth rates. But as tax rates rise, their negative impact on growth rises dramatically. The median voter chooses tax rates that have a small impact on growth prospects, making the relation between tax rates and economic growth difficult to measure empirically.","[Jaimovich, Nir] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Jaimovich, Nir; Rebelo, Sergio] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rebelo, Sergio] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Rebelo, Sergio] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA",University of Southern California; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Jaimovich, N (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;Jaimovich, N (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,46,47,51,1,45,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

A one-off 5% energy efficiency improvement is imposed on five different types of energy, respectively, in all the 135 production sectors in China. The rebound effect is measured both on the production level and on the economy-wide level for each type of energy. The results show that improving energy efficiency of using electricity has the largest positive impact on GDP among the five energy types. Inter-fuel substitutability does not affect the macroeconomic results significantly, but long-run impact is usually greater than the short-run impact. For the exports-oriented sectors, those that are capital-intensive get big negative shock in the short run while those that are labour-intensive get hurt in the long run. There is no backfire effect; however, improving efficiency of using electricity can cause negative rebound, which implies that improving the energy efficiency of using electricity might be a good policy choice under China's current energy structure. In general, macro-level rebound is larger than production-level rebound. Primary energy goods show larger rebound effect than secondary energy goods. In addition, the paper points out that the policy makers in China should look at the rebound effect in the long term rather than in the short term. The energy efficiency policy would be a good and effective policy choice for energy conservation in China when it still has small inter-fuel substitution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Explanations have extrapolated from five piecemeal elements of psychology - failure of cognitive rationality, Pavlovian conditioning, force of habit, incentive salience, and long chains of secondary reward - but in doing so have created models that stretch the properties of these elements as observed in the laboratory. The models are hard to integrate with each other, much less with the utility-maximizing structure of microeconomics. The increasing prominence of addictions, particularly addictions that do not involve a substance, have confronted behavioral science with these shortcomings. I suggest that the roles of all five phenomena follow from the hyperbolic discounting of expected reward: rationality can be seen as maximizing expected discounted reward as seen at a distance, which can be approximated by making choices in bundles; Pavlovian conditioning reduces to reward learning when a very short-term rewarding effect of conditioning stimuli is factored in; habit' subsumes various kinds of reward-seeking, especially that which has been narrowed by failures of self-control; incentive salience is a kind of short-term reward; self-reward is possible - and probably common - without being secondary to inborn turnkeys, limited rather by not being occasioned so often that the appetite(s) for it fail to build up.","[Ainslie, George] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Coatesville, PA 19320 USA; [Ainslie, George] Univ Cape Town, Dept Econ, Cape Town, South Africa",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); University of Cape Town,"Ainslie, G (通讯作者)，Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Coatesville, PA 19320 USA.;Ainslie, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Dept Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.",George.Ainslie@va.gov,,"Ainslie, George/0000-0001-9201-9144",,,,,93,12,14,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The recent growth in the availability of on-line financial news sources, such as internet news and social media sources provides instantaneous access to financial news. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. TRNA is one such data set. In this study, we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for DJIA stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the stock prices of these companies using entropy measures. The entropy and mutual information (MI) statistics permit an analysis of the amount of information within the sentiment series, its relationship to the DJIA and an indication of how the relationship changes over time.","[Allen, David E.] Univ South Australia, Ctr Appl Financial Studies, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Coll Technol Management, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Econometr Inst, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Singh, Abhay K.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA, Australia",University of South Australia; University of Sydney; National Tsing Hua University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Complutense University of Madrid; Edith Cowan University,"Allen, DE (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Ctr Appl Financial Studies, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Allen, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",profallen2007@gmail.com,"Singh, Abhay/AAG-9813-2021; Allen, David/AAM-9744-2021; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Allen, David/JTV-4098-2023","Singh, Abhay/0000-0002-3783-6325",QUANTVALLEY/FdR: 'Quantitative Management Initiative',QUANTVALLEY/FdR: 'Quantitative Management Initiative',This work was supported by the QUANTVALLEY/FdR: 'Quantitative Management Initiative'.,,44,12,12,1,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Almost universally it has been applied using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. An alternative approach, pseudolikelihood (PL) estimation, which decouples estimation of the error component structure and the production frontier, has been adopted in both the non-parametric and panel data settings. To date, no formal comparison has yet to be conducted comparing these methods in a standard, parametric cross-sectional framework. We produce a comparison of these two competing methods using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results indicate that PL estimation enjoys almost identical performance to ML estimation across a range of scenarios and performance metrics, and for certain metrics, outperforms ML estimation when the distribution of inefficiency is incorrectly specified.","RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Div Environm & Resources, Essen, Germany; [Parmeter, Christopher] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, 517-E Jenkins Bldg, Miami, FL 33146 USA",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Miami,"Parmeter, C (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, 517-E Jenkins Bldg, Miami, FL 33146 USA.",cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,,,Collaborative Research Center 'Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 823],Collaborative Research Center 'Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work has been partly supported by the Collaborative Research Center 'Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes (SFB 823)' of the German Research Foundation (DFG), within Project A3, 'Dynamic Technology Modeling'.",,25,9,9,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study seeks to discover that if a firm is financially constrained and its cash flows are highly volatile then it will increase its cash holdings and voluntarily reduce its current investment level due to the intertemporal trade-off between current and future investments. Thus, a positive relationship between cash holdings and future cash flow volatility and a negative relationship between current investments and future cash flow volatility is expected. In order to test the impact of cash flow volatility firms are classified in to constrained and unconstrained groups on the basis of four criteria, i.e., firm size, dividend payment, Kaplan-Zingales (KZ) index and group affiliation. For each criterion estimation is done by using two steps Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. Results show that financially constrained firms increase their cash holdings when cash flow volatility increases while financially unconstrained firms do not, except for KZ index criteria. It is also found that during the 2008 financial crisis constrained firms were more prone to saving cash than unconstrained ones. The study provides important insights into understanding the behaviour of Pakistani firms relating to cash holdings when they are financially constrained and cash flows are highly volatile. This is the first study of its kind that establishes a conclusive relationship between precautionary cash holdings, cash flow volatility and financial constraints in a Pakistani context.","[Azmat, Qurat-ul-ann] NUST, NUST Business Sch, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Iqbal, Abdullah Muhammad] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Chatham, Kent, England",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Kent,"Azmat, QU (通讯作者)，NUST, NUST Business Sch, Islamabad, Pakistan.",aineazmat@gmail.com,"Iqbal, Abdullah/HSG-3427-2023","Iqbal, Abdullah/0000-0002-3013-1007; Azmat, Qurat-ul-ann/0000-0001-8735-5194",,,,,54,5,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that the relationship between the developed and developing markets is time varying. During the first part of our sample, from 2007 to 2012, there is a strong comovement on long scales between the U.S. stock market and stock markets in Brazil, Hong Kong and India. Moreover, the U.S. stock market is following the developing markets, and particularly the Brazilian stock market. However, this relationship disappears after 2012.

Spatial Economic Analysis. Empirical analysis in economics often faces the difficulty that the data are correlated and heterogeneous in some unknown form. Spatial econometric models have been widely used to account for dependence structures, but the problem of directly dealing with unobserved spatial heterogeneity has been largely unexplored. The problem can be serious particularly if we have no prior information justified by economic theory. In this paper we propose a two-step procedure to identify endogenously spatial regimes in the first step and to account for spatial dependence in the second step.

When institutions are relatively efficient, observed corruption is likely to be associated with relatively less competition. Conversely, in areas with low quality institutions (e.g., excessively burdensome regulations), corruption may lead to relatively more competition. I employ unique data on competition, corruption, and institutional quality across U.S. states from 1997 to 2009 and report that a higher level of corruption is associated with relatively more competition in states with low levels of institutional quality. However, as institutional quality improves, the effect of corruption worsens. Thus, institutional quality is a fundamental determinant of the corruption-competition relationship. Improving institutional quality, while at the same time reducing corruption, will increase competition and likely improve economic outcomes.

Their applications serve to streamline various economic processes such as strategic or innovation management. This fact has been accepted in a number of countries that are already trying to effectively open and publicly access data. Transparency is perceived as an important element of institutional, political and corporate culture. A sufficient level of transparency causes the reduction of corruption rates in individual countries. This is not only about government institutions, but about private companies too. Open data and transparency are closely intertwined. The opening of data should effectively increase transparency and reduce the level of corruption in the countries concerned. For this reason, improving transparency and making data available is part of a series of initiatives that are narrowly targeted to this issue. The question is whether the truly open data influences the level of perceived corruption and thus increases transparency. The aim of the paper is to find out whether there is a dependency between the level of perceived corruption and the level of openness of data in the countries of the European Union through statistical regression analysis. The outcome of the contribution is the statistical demonstration or reversal dependence of the level of perception of corruption at the level of openness of data in the countries of the European Union and secondly the evaluation of the effectiveness of the initiatives supporting the reduction of corruption.","[Boubin, Jan] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Boubín, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",jan.boubin@tul.cz,,,SGS [3600/21194],SGS,The article was developed with the support of SGS project No. 3600/21194 The use of Open Data for the purpose of implementing and managing Start - up projects and increasing corporate transparency.,,10,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,483,489,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500054,0

On the other hand, the average fitness of credit risk contagion and the risk aversion sentiments of nodes increase the average clustering coefficient of nodes, whereas the ability to resist risk of nodes decreases this coefficient. Moreover, network size also decreases the average clustering coefficient.","[Chen, Tingqiang] Nanjing Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211816, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Jianmin] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Xindan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Tech University; Southeast University - China; Nanjing University,"Chen, TQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211816, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tingqiang88888888@163.com,"Chen, Tingqiang/N-4473-2019","Chen, Tingqiang/0000-0002-3013-243X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501094]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China [BK20150961]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M561626]; Natural Sciences Research Funded Projects in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu [15KJB120003]; Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Funded Projects in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu [2014SJB081],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Sciences Research Funded Projects in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu; Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Funded Projects in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu,"We wish to express our gratitude to the referees for their invaluable comments.

It is assumed that the civil servants are hired to produce the public goods or services that benefit all the entrepreneurs hiring workers to produce private goods. In considering the case where the position of a civil servant is randomly up for grabs without rent seeking, it is known that the effect of a rise in the number of civil servants to be hired on an individual's ability to borrow is mainly based on the improved efficiency and a rise in the wage due to an increase in the demand for workers. When the position of a civil servant is secured through rent-seeking, it is found that an improvement in the financial environment will lower the cost of rent-seeking if the welfare of the civil servant is not too high.","[Chen, Yao-Tung; Lin, Yuh-Yao] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 250 Chung Shan N Rd,Sec 5, Taipei 111, Taiwan; [Hsu, Ker-Tah] Natl Taichung Univ Educ, Dept Int Business, Taichung, Taiwan; [Kao, Ming-Sung] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Finance & Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kao, Ming-Sung] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Finance & Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University; National Taichung University of Education; Fu Jen Catholic University; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Chen, YT (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 250 Chung Shan N Rd,Sec 5, Taipei 111, Taiwan.",yaotc@mail.mcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The paper argues the EIB shows signs of bad performance; policy output does not fulfil the institution's goals as stated in the Statutes. To demonstrate this, the article leads the way in providing the first combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of EIB lending to European Union members from 1991 to 2015.

The purpose of this research is to determine to what extent the status of being unemployed is influenced by the area (urban/rural), gender, ethnicity, level of education and the age of the person at the county level (NUTS3) in Romania. To achieve this purpose, we used individual data (10% of the total resident population of each county) from the last population and housing census in 2011. We selected the population aged 20 to 64, of whom over 49% were women and over 45% came from rural areas. The analysis were carried out using a logit model estimated with the R software. The results showed that in each county of Romania the status of being unemployed is influenced by the area in which the person lives, by gender and by age. From the ethnical point of view, in most counties, the Roma ethnicity has proved to be a determining factor of unemployment. Although the studies in this research area show that the level of the education is an important determinant of the unemployment, our results show that only in a part of the counties this relation is verified.","[Corina, Schonauer (Sacala)] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Corina, S (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",corina.cori12@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,671,675,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000492966900095,0

The observed increase in economic activities that use energy has had an impulse in the energy industry with higher prices. These prices make profitable the biofuel production, and this encourage the use of cereals for biofuel production, affecting the whole food chain. This research demonstrates that the agricultural foods and energy production system has been in place at least since 2000 and that it remains active or latent depending on the price of energetics. The paper also shows that the temperature variations do not lead the system to an adjustment. To do, this research uses the econometric technique of Dynamic Conditional Correlation, and a new tool, phase synchronization.

Next, we consider a new version of this model, with firms' endowments in the spirit of Geanakoplos et al. (J Math Econ 19:113-151, 1990).

This article suggests using the autoregressive distributed lag approach along with additional explanatory variables such as measures of trade and investment to shed a new light on the link between emissions, energy consumption and income in the two largest and energy-intensive developing economies: China and India. Our results, over the 1971-2009 period, provide evidence that investment plays a major role in shaping the relationship between carbon emissions, energy consumption and income in China while this is not the case in India. Furthermore, trade openness is found to play a key function in the short term in China but does not contribute to the emissions-energy-growth scenario in India.","[Duc Khuong Nguyen] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Sevi, Benoit] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France; [Sjo, Bo; Uddin, Gazi Salah] Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden",IPAG Business School; Nantes Universite; Linkoping University,"Nguyen, DK (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",duc.nguyen@ipag.fr,"Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020; Uddin, Gazi Salah/L-6135-2019; Sjo, Bo/J-1280-2014","Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787; Salah Uddin, Gazi/0000-0002-5744-0192; Sjo, Bo/0000-0002-8145-1000",Jan Wallanders and the Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallanders and the Tom Hedelius Foundation,Gazi Salah Uddin is thankful for the financial support from Jan Wallanders and the Tom Hedelius Foundation.,,59,14,14,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Firm-level data from four rounds of Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys from 2002 to 2014 is pooled to assess whether international exposure translates into greater propensity for firms to innovate. The viability of different channels of international technology transmission, i.e. exporting and importing activities, foreign licensing agreements and foreign direct investment are studied to analyze whether they indeed succeed in delivering the push to the firms operating in developing countries to innovate and as a result push them closer to the world's technology frontier. The empirical results endorse the view that exporting and importing activities and foreign licensing agreements are important channels for technology transfer.

Their main merits are that they can be computed on the basis of publicly available time series, rather than hard-to-acquire micro data, and are derived from the assessments of actors in a multitude of economic sectors, rather than just a single one, which makes them particularly suitable to assess more comprehensively the impact of uncertainty on economic activity. Empirical analysis shows the indicators to be counter-cyclical with major uncertainty peaks coinciding with low growth. Moreover, shocks to our uncertainty measures are found to be a quantitatively important driver of economic fluctuations, leading to a temporary reduction in real activity without any signs of overshooting. A comparison with other commonly used uncertainty proxies shows that the new indicators account for a much larger fraction of real GDP variability.","[Girardi, Alessandro] Istat, Italian Natl Inst Stat, Rome, Italy; [Reuter, Andreas] European Commiss DG ECFIN, Brussels, Belgium",,"Girardi, A (通讯作者)，Istat, Italian Natl Inst Stat, Rome, Italy.",alessandro.girardi@istat.it,,,,,,,31,25,26,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

According to our results, monetary policy news shocks account for a non negligible fraction of the variance of real variables, especially at shorter forecast horizons. Further, we document that the importance of monetary policy news shocks goes beyond what was observed in recent years. The historical importance of monetary policy news shocks dates back to the 1999-2006 period when the official FOMC statements provided information about both the current policy setting and the expected future policy path.

J,"Hall, RE",,,,"Hall, Robert E.",,,The Anatomy of Stagnation in a Modern Economy,ECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In 2008, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression launched a deep contraction of the US economy. Output fell quickly to a level 10% below trend. Unemployment reached 10% of the labour force. Seven years after the crisis, unemployment was back to normal, but output was 15% below trend. Stagnation had set in. The most important source of the stagnation was a sharp decline in productivity growth. A decline in R&D and other productivity-enhancing investment was at least partially responsible. That decline began before the crisis, but the financial events of 2008 worsened the cutback. A second major source of stagnated output and income was capital depletion. Investment in business equipment fell in half immediately after the crisis. Cumulatively, the effect of below-trend investment accounted for 5 of the 15 percentage points of the shortfall in output. The third major development accounting for stagnation in output was a decline in the labour force that remained after unemployment had returned to normal. This development accounted for more than 3 percentage points of the shortfall in output. As a general matter, the direct decline in labour input and in output associated with the rise in unemployment was not important by 2015, but the follow-on stagnation operating through the effects on the two types of capital formation was substantial.","[Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hall, Robert E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hall, RE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Hall, RE (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Hoover Institution,Hoover Institution,"The research was supported by the Hoover Institution.

From a theoretical perspective both employers and employees benefit from such an instrument. Indeed, empirical studies show that life satisfaction of workers is larger under a WTA regime than under a non-WTA regime. However, more detailed investigations in this article reveal wages to be lower for men under WTA regimes. Why should men accept WTA when they earn less? Subgroup analyses show that these results are only valid for some groups of individuals. Our analysis allows us to deliver some explanations and to exclude other possible reasons. The major results are: (1) High-income workers suffer higher losses; (2) the shorter the compensation period of WTA systems the lower the wage reduction imposed by WTA; (3) the length of total working time does not seem to affect the link between WTA and wages but the length of overtime; (4) men accept wage losses from WTA if they can adjust actual to desired working hours.","[Huebler, Olaf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Hübler, O (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",huebler@ewifo.uni-hannover.de,,"Hubler, Olaf/0000-0003-4872-6954",,,,,5,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In doing so, we attempt to extend the existing literature by taking into account the role of macroeconomic instability as well as public borrowing. Our results reveal that there are additional - albeit indirect - channels between finance and growth via the effects of macro instability and public borrowing on financial development and economic growth. After taking into account the effects of overall instability and public borrowing, we found that growth-financial development relationship is bidirectional and permanent. In other words, in Turkish case, economic growth and financial development are jointly determined.

A Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall approach,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hybrid securities; Bank solvency; CoCos; Expected Shortfall; Value-at-Risk,,This paper examines how issuing an innovative financial instrument called contingent convertible bond (CoCo) may enhance bank's solvency in comparison to issuing a conventional bond. CoCos convert automatically into common equity or have a principal write-down when bank's regulatory capital fails to meet a predetermined level. They have been invented and put into legislation with an objective to absorb losses thus preventing institutions from bankruptcy. From the standpoint of an issuer CoCos bring about two counter effects regarding his solvency: on one hand they recapitalize a bank approaching insolvency on the other hand CoCos pay much higher coupon comparing to conventional bonds. In our model a bank has two funding alternatives: either to issue CoCos or conventional bonds. We measure issuer's default risk using the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). We conclude that CoCos have the potential to strengthen the resilience of the issuer on the condition that the probability of conversion triggering is higher than the VaR's significance level. Our findings can be helpful to the policymakers and banks to better understand the impact of CoCos on issuer's solvency.,"[Jaworski, Piotr] Univ Warsaw, Inst Math, Warsaw, Poland; [Liberadzki, Kamil; Liberadzki, Marcin] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Warsaw School of Economics,"Liberadzki, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Finance, Warsaw, Poland.",P.Jaworski@mimuw.edu.pl; kliber@sgh.waw.pl; mliber@sgh.waw.pl,"Liberadzki, Kamil/C-1920-2016; Jaworski, Piotr/AAD-7548-2019","Jaworski, Piotr/0000-0001-8540-2698",Polish National Science Center programme [2015/17/B/HS4/00911],Polish National Science Center programme,We are particularly grateful to the reviewers who took the trouble to send us valuable corrections and comments.

Gregory Hayden. To clarify the controversial points, I structure my response narrative along two lines. First, I present the prehistory of IMT, or X- and Y- theory, including earlier work by scientists related to the concept of institutional matrix. I connect the development of the actual IMT with the period of perestroika and the associated market experiments and reforms in Russia and Eastern European countries. One could see that the effects of market reforms in Russia were different in comparison with other countries in economic transition. I show that the institutional approach was accepted as more relevant to understanding the unexpected results in Russian society. I present IMT as a development of the ideas of Karl Polanyi and Douglas North to answer the challenges of explaining the real social and economic processes in Russia, as well as its wider application to a broader range of economic and social situations in different countries.

The retrospective cohort study used hospital financial data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and the annual hospital survey conducted by the American Hospital Association. The sample included 1000 California hospitals from 2006 to 2010. The effect of hospitalist care on hospital malpractice premiums was evaluated using generalized estimation equation models with log link normal distribution after controlling for hospital and market characteristics, patient utilization and staffing patterns. In multivariable analyses, hospitals with more full-time hospitalists per average daily census were associated with lower malpractice insurance premiums. For example, a one-hospitalist increase per 100 daily censuses resulted in a 5.1% reduction in malpractice insurance premiums. Hospitalist care was associated with a reduction in malpractice insurance expenses. The data reveal that hospitalist care is more efficient and effective in patient treatment and preventing complications. The improved efficiency may reduce malpractice insurance expenses.","[Lee, Jinhyung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",leejinh@skku.edu,"Lee, JIn/HTL-6278-2023; Lee, Ji Hyung/HNI-8824-2023",,National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A8017474]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea,"National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A5A8017474).,,36,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A laboratory market is used to investigate the impact of the divergent degree on the stability of the financial market. Simulation results indicate that the market becomes more stable as investors become increasingly divergent and are more likely to absorb the orders of the other side and maintain a narrow trade gap. Moreover, with highly heterogeneous investors, the market is more efficient, less liable to crash and less volatile. The simulation, based on the agent-based model, demonstrates that the interactions and herding behaviours of investors lead to a market crash when the divergent structure shrinks and only limited investment horizons are available. The result also suggests an alternate explanation of the anomaly of efficient market hypothesis, which shows why the momentum and contrarian strategies can earn excess returns in the short term and the long term, respectively. It also verifies the hypothesis that heterogeneous investors with different investment horizons provide market liquidity.","[Li, Daye; Li, Rongrong; Sun, Qiankun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Sun, QK (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zw_gtmoon@163.com,"Li, Rongrong/B-8365-2019","Li, Rongrong/0000-0002-0485-3188",,,,,27,3,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It has also been shown that if a short memory process is contaminated by level shifts, the estimate of the long memory parameter tends to be upward biased. In this article, we directly estimate a random level shift model to the logarithm of the absolute returns of five exchange rates series, in order to assess whether random level shifts (RLSs) can explain this long memory property. Our results show that there are few level shifts for the five series, but once they are taken into account the long memory property of the series disappears. We also provide out-of-sample forecasting comparisons, which show that, in most cases, the RLS model outperforms popular models in forecasting volatility.

We examine the nature and size of water pollution externalities as rivers flow across jurisdictions. Panel data on water pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county splits that change the locations of borders allow us to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for fixed effects and trends specific to each location. The theory of externalities predicts that pollution should increase at an increasing rate as the river approaches the downstream exit border, that there should be a structural break in the slope of the pollution function at the border, and that a larger number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate pollution externalities. We find support for all four predictions in the data. Satellite data on growth in night-time lights along rivers show that local authorities allow more settlements to develop close to rivers in the downstream portions of counties, which is the likely underlying mechanism. The border effects on pollution are not as pronounced when the cost of inter-jurisdictional coordination is lower.","[Lipscomb, Molly] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Mobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Virginia; Yale University,"Lipscomb, M (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,,Resources for the Future; Corporacion Andina de Fomento; National Science Foundation,Resources for the Future; Corporacion Andina de Fomento; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Jim Berry, Marianne Bertrand, Bill Evans, Claudio Ferraz, Andrew Foster, Terence Johnson, Erin Mansur, Bernardo Mueller, Hilary Sigman, Monica Singhal, Florian Ederer, Jerome Adda, five anonymous referees, numerous water management practitioners at the federal and various state water agencies in Brazil, and seminar participants at Harvard University, University of Michigan, Yale University, World Bank Research Department, the University of Colorado at Boulder, Resources for the Future, NC State, Wesleyan University, the World Bank Microeconomics of Growth Conference (Rio de Janeiro), 2008 Econometric Society Winter Meetings, 2007 NEUDC Conference, 2007 NBER Summer Institute in Environmental Economics, 2007 BREAD conference and the 2006 ISNIE conference for helpful discussions and comments.

During this period, macroeconomic policy aimed to preserve a stable and competitive real exchange rate (SCRER). There is controversy on whether the SCRER policy was a key factor fostering growth and, even more, on whether it helped promote the expansion of tradable activities and exports. We use a methodology to detect episodes of export surges among Argentina's export industries and find that labor-intensive industries-especially low- and medium-technology manufactures-experienced the highest proportion of export surges within this period. We also find that between 1980 and 2015, the highest proportion of surges in total exports occurred during the 2003-8 period. The performance of export of services was also particularly dynamic during this period. This evidence suggests that the SCRER policy was instrumental for export surges in Argentina during 2002-8.","[Palazzo, Gabriel; Rapetti, Martin] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Palazzo, Gabriel; Rapetti, Martin] Natl Sci & Tech Res Council CONICET, CEDES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Palazzo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Palazzo, G (通讯作者)，Natl Sci & Tech Res Council CONICET, CEDES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,"Palazzo, Gabriel/P-2860-2017","Palazzo, Gabriel/0000-0003-1552-3835",,,,,19,5,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We assert that the effectiveness of the country's military intelligence is contingent on the quality of its human capital, which, in turn, implies a long-term positive relationship between the government's various civilian expenditures and its capacity to achieve a cost-effective intelligence and, hence, military capability. This relationship is developed within a multiple-period arms race model between two rivals. Using this model and stylized data for the Israeli-Syrian arms race, we show that an appropriate budget shift from defense to civilian expenditures during the initial periods of the planning horizon will gradually (over a decade, say) increase the quality of human capital in the country and, thus, the effectiveness of its intelligence, which, in turn, will increase the country's future security and welfare.","[Pecht, Eyal; Tishler, Asher] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Tishler, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, Tel Aviv, Israel.",atishler@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,84,3,3,3,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Specifically, we analyze the influence of personality traits on the decision by military applicants either to choose the military or a civilian career option. We use a unique micro-level data-set of applicants to the US Navy and exploit the fact that many individuals who initially apply for military jobs eventually choose civilian careers instead. In this institutional setting, job candidates use new information to update their beliefs about the military job match. Personality traits are viewed as productive abilities that influence applicants' expectations about the economic return to the job and occupational training offered by the Navy. The study finds that many of the 15 lower order personality facets associated with the Big Five traits are predictive of applicants' job choices and provides suggestive evidence of a link between personality traits, job match expectations, and career choice.","[Pema, Elda; Mehay, Stephen; Tick, Simona] Naval Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Business & Publ Policy, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Mehay, S (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Business & Publ Policy, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",smehay@nps.edu,,,"Navy Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education project at the Naval Postgraduate School","Navy Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education project at the Naval Postgraduate School","We thank Jeremy Arkes, Elizabeth Bradley, and Jeff Peterson for helpful comments.

These changes have brought new insight into research on innovation activities and specific innovation practices in organisations, including that previous research largely ignored small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper tests a variance-based structural equation model (SEM) for selected antecedents and determinants of commercialisation enablers on a sample of 105 SMEs from Slovenia - a small, open, post-transition economy with a dominant SME sector. The main contribution of the paper lies in testing how two specific open innovation practices (open innovation information exchange and open innovation collaboration) impact the commercialisation enablers of high-tech SMEs through their innovation activities (antecedent) and their innovativeness (determinant). Both open innovation practices show statistically significant effect on high-tech SMEs' innovativeness, thus supporting the idea that both collaboration and information exchange lead to more innovativeness in high-tech SMEs. They also show a high impact of internal (organisational) factors on innovation activities of and a high impact of innovativeness on the commercialisation enablers of high-tech SMEs.","[Pustovrh, Ales; Jaklic, Marko; Martin, Sheila A.; Raskovic, Matevz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Pustovrh, Ales; Jaklic, Marko; Raskovic, Matevz] Ctr Excellence Biosensors Instrumentat & Proc Con, Solkan, Slovenia; [Martin, Sheila A.] Portland State Univ, Inst Portland Metropolitan Studies, Portland, OR 97207 USA",University of Ljubljana; Portland State University,"Pustovrh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.;Pustovrh, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Excellence Biosensors Instrumentat & Proc Con, Solkan, Slovenia.",ales.pustovrh@ef.uni-lj.si,"Raskovic, Matevz/AFV-3565-2022","Raskovic, Matevz/0000-0001-5311-4050; Pustovrh, Ales/0000-0002-7121-5215",EU European Regional Development fund,EU European Regional Development fund(European Union (EU)),This research was supported by the EU European Regional Development fund.

One of the specific research questions arising is whether conventional theoretical arguments originated in studies on developed-country MNEs are still valid for explaining the international behavior of emerging-market MNEs. Drawing on the institutional theory, this paper argues that the influence of host country institutional factors on location decisions differs between Chinese and Indian MNEs. We hypothesize that the negative impact of both cultural distance and political risk on location decisions is lower for Chinese MNEs as compared to Indian MNEs. From a sample of 832 outward foreign direct investments (OFDIs) we obtain empirical support for these hypotheses.","[Quer, Diego; Claver, Enrique; Rienda, Laura] Univ Alicante, Dept Management, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Quer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Management, Alicante, Spain.",diego.quer@ua.es,"Quer, Diego/E-7418-2017; Claver-Cortés, Enrique/AAC-5901-2020; Rienda, Laura/R-8699-2018","Quer, Diego/0000-0002-5814-6411; Rienda, Laura/0000-0002-1940-4035",,,,,73,21,24,1,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This change has taken place against a backdrop of a shift in general public attitudes (in Poland) towards the European Union, and a more specific shift in public opinion on the desirability of monetary integration on the supranational level caused by the economic crisis.

Next, we extend our model by incorporating borrowing and emulation effects into workers' consumption behavior, under different assumptions about how debt is serviced. Our results demonstrate that borrowing and emulation transform the relationship between distribution and growth, giving rise to the possibility of a 'consumption-driven, profit-led' growth regime (Kapeller and Schutz 2015) and what we call the 'paradox of inequality.' A key conclusion is that the wage- or profit-led characteristics of the growth process, rather than being invariant, can be altered by social constructs such as borrowing and consumption norms that change over time.","[Setterfield, Mark] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Kim, Yun K.] Univ Massachusetts, Boston, MA 02125 USA",The New School; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Setterfield, M (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking; Dana Foundation,Institute for New Economic Thinking; Dana Foundation,"Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Boston, 6-9 March 2014, at the Fundacao de Economia e Estatistica (FEE), Porto Alegre, Brazil, 12 August 2014, and at UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 8 March 2016.

We find economic growth is not emission-intensive in Australia, while energy consumption is emissions intensive. Second, in an environment of increasing population, our findings suggest Australia needs to be energy efficient at the household level, creating appropriate infrastructure for sustainable population growth. High population growth and open migration policy can be detrimental in reducing CO2 emissions. Finally, we establish globalized environment has been conducive in combating emissions.

Various measures of HC are utilized to determine which of these produces a better explanation of economic growth in the two Asian regions. The study finds that primary and secondary education was more prominent in explaining the fluctuations of economic growth in East Asia, whereas tertiary and vocational education showed positive effects on economic growth in South Asia. Government expenditures on education were also found to positively affect economic growth in both regions.

Copulas have been used to overcome these problems, but the Fleishman procedure, which uses a polynomial transformation to generate non-normal data, may provide a more tractable alternative. In this article, EC simulation estimates using the extended (multivariate) Fleishman method and the Gumbel copula are compared. The Fleishman approach is found to be easier to implement than the Gumbel approach and provides comparable results when the correlation and concordance between losses are low. The Fleishman method preserves the first four moments and two measures of dependence (Pearson's rho and Kendal's tau); the copula approach preserves only the first two moments of the empirical loss distributions.","[van Vuuren, Gary; de Jongh, Riaan] North West Univ, Ctr Business Math & Informat, Potchefstroom Campus,Hoffman St, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"van Vuuren, G (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Ctr Business Math & Informat, Potchefstroom Campus,Hoffman St, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",gary.vanvuuren@nwu.ac.za,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538; de Jongh, Riaan/0000-0002-7979-256X",Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa,Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa,This work was supported in part by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa.,,45,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, the link between tax structure and economic growth has revived the Laffer hypothesis that implies the existence of a parabolic relationship between level of taxation and achieved revenues. Our own hypothesis is that urban areas have an equally significant impact on willingness to pay taxes and that there can be as much or even more heterogeneity among urban sizes as there is among different territories. Methods: We contrast the Laffer hypothesis for the Spanish case under different spatial scenarios using microdata for 2009 provided by the country's Institute for Fiscal Studies (IEF). We employ a cross-sectional sample of tax filers, estimated by means of least squares. Results: The presence of a parabolic relationship between the tax burden and tax collection enables us to obtain a revenue-maximizing tax rate of around 30%, twice the average rate currently applied. In our analysis by regions, we find significant variations that justify the existence of a high level of fiscal decentralization. However, this variability is also found to be significant in our analysis by size of city. The maximum tax revenue of the two main cities Madrid and Barcelona is obtained at a tax rate of 34%; with all other cities reaching their maximum revenue levels at similar rates. Conclusions: The smaller the city, the lower the rate that maximizes tax revenue, with the gap between the real rate and the optimal rate being greater the smaller the city.","[Varela-Candamio, Laura] Univ A Coruna, Dept Anal Econ & Adm Empresas, Grp Jean Monnet Competencia & Desarrollo Reg C D, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain; [Rubiera Morollon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, Lab Anal Econ Reg REGIOlab, Campus El Cristo, Oviedo, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; University of Oviedo,"Varela-Candamio, L (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Anal Econ & Adm Empresas, Grp Jean Monnet Competencia & Desarrollo Reg C D, Campus Elvina, La Coruna, Spain.",laura.varela.candamio@udc.es; frubiera@uniovi.es,"Varela-Candamio, Laura/L-4160-2014","Varela-Candamio, Laura/0000-0001-9321-3280",,,,,22,2,2,0,13,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

However, no research has been conducted on the price dynamics between the supermarket and non-supermarket sectors to investigate whether the non-supermarket sector can impose competitive discipline on the dominating supermarket chains. We argue that standard cointegration tests cannot allow for transaction costs and distinguish whether the price co-movement is attributable to price competition or collusion. Our study therefore fills this research gap by adopting the threshold cointegration tests in a three-regime threshold vector error-correction model to account for the asymmetric price adjustment dynamics between supermarket and non-supermarket sectors of Hong Kong and evaluate the market power of the supermarket sectors in the presence of transaction costs. Our results favour the presence of cointegration between the supermarket and non-supermarket price indices with asymmetric adjustment dynamics. We interpret the results of statistically significant downward price adjustments in the outer-band regimes as the evidence of mutual price competition. Nevertheless, the supermarket sector has stronger market power than the non-supermarket sector, and therefore can sustain higher price level without inducing substantial competition pressures inside the neutral band.","[Woo, Kai-yin; Lee, Shu-kam] Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Braemar Hill Rd, North Point, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shum, Paul] Western Sydney Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Hong Kong Shue Yan University; Western Sydney University,"Woo, KY (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Braemar Hill Rd, North Point, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kywoo@hksyu.edu,"Shum, Paul/AGD-1935-2022","Shum, Paul/0000-0001-6218-0172",University Grants Committee (UGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Faculty Development Scheme (FDS) [UGC/FDS15/B06/14],University Grants Committee (UGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Faculty Development Scheme (FDS),The research of this article is funded by the University Grants Committee (UGC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Faculty Development Scheme (FDS) [Project Number UGC/FDS15/B06/14].,,47,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Meanwhile, the income gap has continued to increase. There are conflicting views regarding whether the defence expenditure is capable of reducing income inequality. Therefore, this paper investigates the existence of any spillover effect of defence expenditure on income inequality, with a special focus on the regional differences among 31 provinces and 7 military regions in China. We extend panel cointegration and the impulse response function by using panel data during the period of 1997-2012. The empirical results show that the defence expenditure has an impact on income inequality, and the effect varies over different regions in China. The defence expenditure has a spillover effect on income inequality in the full sample panel and the southeastern panel. An increase in the defence expenditure does not crowd out social welfare spending due to the high level of economic development and government expenditure. On the contrary, in the northern panel, the effect is opposite because of the unbalanced economic development levels within the panel. Beijing as the capital of China, benefits more from the expansion of defence expenditure thus widening the income gap. In addition, the impulse response analyses further confirm a stronger effect of the defence expenditure on income inequality in the northern and the southeastern panels over a short period.","[Zhang, Ying; Wang, Rui; Yao, Dongqi] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Peking University,"Wang, R (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ruiwang0721@gmail.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [15CGL045]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473036]; Ministry of Education of China [14YJC790110]; Ministry of Education of Jiangsu Province [2014SJD013]; Social Science Research Grant of Southeast University [2242015S22005]; European Commission,"National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Ministry of Education of Jiangsu Province; Social Science Research Grant of Southeast University; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 15CGL045], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71473036], Ministry of Education of China [grant number 14YJC790110], Ministry of Education of Jiangsu Province [grant number 2014SJD013], Social Science Research Grant of Southeast University [grant number 2242015S22005] and European Commission.",,31,3,3,1,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Second, there does exist energy rebound effect in China's aggregate Industry, which ranges from 20% to 76% during 1995-2012 (or 39% on average).

A household's social ties in the region of origin, which we refer to as local social capital, may deter migration, because local social capital is location specific and an individual cannot benefit from it if s/he migrates. In view of Chinese gift-giving culture, we use household expenses on wedding gifts for family members outside household, relatives and friends as a proxy for local social networks. Based on the data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find that in rural China local social networks have a significantly negative effect on migration.

Focusing on the dirtiest sectors of 25 EU countries in the period 1997-2005 and considering the endogeneity issue, we estimate an adjusted EKC relationship comparing a single equation model (univariate model) with a simultaneous equations system (bivariate model). Following Lopez (J Environ Econ Manag 27:163-184, 1994), a second equation is introduced where per capita income is a positive function of conventional factors as labour, capital, and technology. Our findings confirm that a negative relationship between income and CO2 emissions is dominant and seems that only the decreasing branch of the EKC is relevant. As regards the composition effect, emissions of the dirtiest sectors decrease when income increases. The impact of energy/input mix confirms that changing the energy mix may reduce emissions. The technique effects shows that the direct effect of R&D expenditure reduces pollution while the indirect effect is mixed: private R&D reinforces the reduction of emissions, the public spending on R&D instead increases emissions.","[Auci, Sabrina] Univ Palermo, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Via Maqueda 324, I-90134 Palermo, Italy; [Trovato, Giovanni] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Palermo; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Auci, S (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Via Maqueda 324, I-90134 Palermo, Italy.",sabrina.auci@unipa.it; giovanni.trovato@uniroma2.it,"Auci, Sabrina/ABC-9560-2020","Auci, Sabrina/0000-0001-9339-152X",,,,,41,10,10,0,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Within a given auction format, the effect of informing bidders differs. In first-price auctions, revenue is higher when bidders are informed, while the opposite is true in English clock auctions. The optimal choice for an auction designer who wishes to maximize revenue is a first-price auction with uninformed bidders.","[Aycinena, Diego] Univ Rodario, Fac Econ, Calle 12C 6-25, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Rentschler, Lucas] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3500 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Rentschler, L (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3500 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",lucas.rentschler@usu.edu,"Aycinena, Diego/KCL-1336-2024; Aycinena, Diego/I-9259-2014","Aycinena, Diego/0000-0001-6330-5926; Rentschler, Lucas/0000-0001-9470-8752",International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics,International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics,"Financial support from the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics is gratefully acknowledged.

For that purpose, we compute a recommended interest rate for the Fed's staff based on its own Greenbook forecasts and a time-varying monetary policy rule a la Taylor (1993), and compare it with the actual target rate. First, we find that there has been internal disagreement between FOMC members and the Fed's staff about the appropriate policy rate. Second, we reveal that members with an occupational background in finance favor a relatively more hawkish monetary policy. In addition, a preference towards a tighter monetary policy is found under a Democratic President and during Alan Greenspan's tenure as the Fed's Chairman. Finally, higher oil prices, a low degree of uncertainty, and episodes of financial stability are also associated with higher interest rates as compared to the Fed staff's recommendation.","[Bennani, Hamza] Univ Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France; [Kranz, Tobias] Univ Trier, Trier, Germany; [Neuenkirch, Matthias] Univ Trier, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Neuenkirch, Matthias] CESifo, D-54286 Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier; Universitat Trier; Ifo Institut,"Neuenkirch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Econ, D-54286 Trier, Germany.;Neuenkirch, M (通讯作者)，CESifo, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",neuenkirch@uni-trier.de,"Bennani, Hamza/AAA-7967-2022; Bennani, Hamza/AAF-6997-2021","Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897; Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897; Neuenkirch, Matthias/0000-0002-7451-3613",,,,,44,5,5,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Using high frequency financial data and quantile regression techniques we characterise some stylised facts about standard betas, diffusion betas and jump betas and the relationships between them for Japanese bank stocks and portfolios. Data are for the period 2001-2012 at 5-min frequency. We find that jump betas, which relate to the arrival of unexpected news, are on average higher and more dispersed than the diffusion betas across Japanese banks. While the standard beta is a weighted average of the diffusion and jump betas, the magnitudes of the weights differ significantly across quantiles (the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th), indicating a non-linearity in how jump information is incorporated across the quantiles. On average, small bank stocks and portfolios have smaller diffusion betas and smaller jump betas than large bank stocks and portfolios. While there are no significant differences between the jump-diffusion beta ratios when conditioned by market capitalisation, during times of financial crisis small banks have significantly higher jump beta-diffusion beta ratios than large banks on average, indicating that during time of financial crisis smaller Japanese banks face much higher relative jump risks than larger Japanese banks.

Thus, a study aimed at measuring the effects of socially responsible strategic partnerships on building brand equity of integrated business structures (IBS) will provide deeper insights into assessing the effectiveness and relevance of disseminating CSR practices. Purpose of the article: The paper attempts to evaluate the degree of effect of socially responsible strategic partnerships on building strong brand equity of integrated business structures. Methods: The participants in the assessment have been selected from the Forbes TOP 200 largest companies in Ukraine (the ranking was based not only on sales, such metrics as companies' financial performance, total assets and their current assessed value were also considered). The input data on the CSR indices were obtained from the Center for CSR Development Ukraine. The index of loyalty to a certain brand was calculated as an integral ratio of satisfaction and importance to customers (based on online survey results). To analyze the impact of the endogenous variable of CSR on IBS branding effectiveness (customer loyalty index and brand equity) and its cost effectiveness, correlation regression and factor analysis methods were applied. Findings & Value added: This study demonstrates the feasibility and economic justification of the impact of socially responsible strategic partnerships on brand equity development for integrated business structures. The research has significant implications for brand management of integrated business structures by providing empirical evidence that will improve understanding of the need to implement the concept of socially responsible branding that right today resonates with the moral society.","[Ganushchak-Efimenko, Lyudmila; Shcherbak, Valeriia; Nifatova, Olena] Kyiv Natl Univ Technol & Design, Nemyrovych Danchenko St 2, UA-01011 Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Kyiv National University of Technologies & Design,"Shcherbak, V (通讯作者)，Kyiv Natl Univ Technol & Design, Nemyrovych Danchenko St 2, UA-01011 Kiev, Ukraine.",valery_shcherbak@i.ua,"Shcherbak, Valery V.G./P-6903-2016; Nifatova, Olena/AAN-4175-2020","Nifatova, Olena/0000-0001-9325-6176",,,,,25,19,19,1,15,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

This paper empirically analyzes the role of culture in determining the labor market engagement of women within the context of collective models of household decision making In particular, we use the epidemiological approach to study the relationship between gender in language and labor market participation among married female immigrants to the U.S. We show that the presence of gender in language can act as a marker for culturally acquired gender roles and that these roles are important determinants of household labor allocations. Female immigrants who speak a language with sex-based grammatical rules exhibit lower labor force participation, hours worked, and weeks worked. Our strategy of isolating one component of culture reveals that roughly two thirds of this relationship can be explained by correlated cultural factors, including the role of bargaining power in the household, and the impact of ethnic enclaves and that at most one third is potentially explained by language having a causal impact.","[Gay, Victor] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 5757S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hicks, Daniel L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Santacreu-Vasut, Estefania] ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Santacreu-Vasut, Estefania] THEMA, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Shoham, Amir] Temple Univ, 1801N Brd St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Shoham, Amir] COMAS, 1801N Brd St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Chicago; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; ESSEC Business School; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Santacreu-Vasut, E (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Dept Econ, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.;Santacreu-Vasut, E (通讯作者)，THEMA, 3 Ave Bernard Hirsch, F-95021 Cergy Pontoise, France.",santacreuvasut@essec.edu,"Gay, Victor/AAV-7441-2020","Gay, Victor/0000-0001-9912-3841",,,,,41,26,29,2,63,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

While it has been frequently stated that countries with an exceptionally youthful population are more prone to violent conflicts, we argue that the rebellious potential of a youth bulge depends on the presence of institutional bottlenecks in general, and labor-market restrictions in particular, as these constraints lower the youth-specific cost of engaging in insurrection activities. We test how labor-market restrictions, as approximated by changes in unemployment, interact with the relative youth cohort size in determining the aggregate conflict risk for a sample of 119 countries for the post-Cold War period. Exploiting exogenous variation in the demographic structure by measuring the size of the youth cohort when its members where born, our results suggest that youth bulges constitute the demographic environment in which rising unemployment is more likely to trigger social tensions and violent conflicts. Moreover, we find that the degree to which large youth cohorts raise the probability of a conflict onset depends more generally on the quality of labor and business regulation, political institutions, and ethnic tensions.","[Gerling, Lena] Univ Munster, Ctr Interdisciplinary Econ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Gerling, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Ctr Interdisciplinary Econ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",lena.gerling@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,80,1,1,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

But after the financial crises and Great Recession, in which roughly eight million homes were foreclosed on and about $7 trillion in home equity was erased, economists and policymakers are re-evaluating the role of homeownership in the American Dream. Many question whether the American Dream should really include homeownership or instead focus more on other aspects of upward mobility, and most acknowledge that homeownership is not for everyone. We take a detailed look at US homeownership from three different perspectives: 1) an international perspective, comparing US homeownership rates with those of other nations; 2) a demographic perspective, examining the correlation between changes in the US homeownership rate between 1985 and 2015 and factors like age, race/ethnicity, education, family status, and income; 3) and, a financial benefits perspective, using national data since 2002 to calculate the internal rate of return to homeownership compared to alternative investments. Our overall conclusion: homeownership is a valuable institution. While two decades of policies in the 1990s and early 2000s may have put too much faith in the benefits of homeownership, the pendulum seems to have swung too far the other way, and many now may have too little faith in homeownership as part of the American Dream.","[Goodman, Laurie S.] Urban Inst, Housing Finance Policy Ctr, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Mayer, Christopher] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, Real Estate, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mayer, Christopher] Natl Bur Econom Res, Cambridge, MA USA",Urban Institute; Columbia University,"Goodman, LS (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Housing Finance Policy Ctr, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",lgoodman@urban.org; cm310@gsb.columbia.edu,,,Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute; Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School,Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute; Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School,"The opinions, analysis, and conclusions of this paper are those of the authors.

Friedman focused on two real measures, the unemployment rate and the real interest rate, but the message was broaderin the longer run, monetary policy controls only the price level. We call this the monetary-policy invariance hypothesis. By 1968, macroeconomics had adopted the basic Phillips curve as the favored model of correlations between inflation and unemployment, and Friedman used the Phillips curve in the exposition of the invariance hypothesis. Friedman's presidential address was commonly interpreted as a recommendation to add a previously omitted variable, the rate of inflation anticipated by the public, to the right-hand side of what then became an augmented Phillips curve. We believe that Friedman's main message, the invariance hypothesis about long-term outcomes, has prevailed over the last half-century based on the broad sweep of evidence from many economies over many years. Subsequent research has not been kind to the Phillips curve, but we will argue that Friedman's exposition of the invariance hypothesis in terms of a 1960s-style Phillips curve is incidental to his main message.","[Hall, Robert E.] Stanford Univ, Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sargent, Thomas J.] NYU, Econ & Business, New York, NY USA; [Sargent, Thomas J.] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; New York University,"Hall, RE (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rehall@stanford.edu; thomas.sargent@nyu.edu,,,,,,,28,20,21,3,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

When public borrowing is constrained due to sovereign default or by a binding fiscal rule, a rise in a country's initial debt level lowers investment in public infrastructure and makes tax setting more aggressive in that jurisdiction, while the opposite occurs elsewhere. On net a jurisdiction with higher initial debt becomes a less attractive location. Our analysis is inspired by fiscal responses in severely hit countries after the economic and financial crisis which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find a similar pattern on the sub-national level using administrative data from the universe of German municipalities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

An ETF is an investment vehicle, with a specific architecture that typically seeks to track the performance of a specific index. The first US-listed ETF, the SPDR, was launched by State Street in January 1993 and seeks to track the S&P 500 index. It is still today the largest ETF by far, with assets of $178 billion. Following the introduction of the SPDR, new ETFs were launched tracking broad domestic and international indices, and more specialized sector, region, or country indexes. In recent years, ETFs have grown substantially in assets, diversity, and market significance, including substantial increases in assets in bond ETFs and so-called smart beta funds that track certain investment strategies often used by actively traded mutual funds and hedge funds. In this paper, we begin by describing the structure and organization of exchange-traded funds, contrasting them with mutual funds, which are close relatives of exchange-traded funds, describing the differences in how ETFs operate and their potential advantages in terms of liquidity, lower expenses, tax efficiency, and transparency. We then turn to concerns over whether the rise in ETFs may raise unexpected risks for investors or greater instability in financial markets. While concerns over financial fragility are worth serious consideration, some of the common concerns are overstated, and for others, a number of rules and practices are already in place that offer a substantial margin of safety.","[Lettau, Martin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lettau, Martin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lettau, Martin] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Madhavan, Ananth] Black Rock Inc, ETF & Index Investing Res, San Francisco, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Financial Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Lettau, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England.",lettau@berkeley.edu; ananth.madhavan@berkeley.edu,"Lettau, Martin/P-4844-2018","Lettau, Martin/0000-0003-4049-4706",,,,,41,57,67,4,151,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This paper uses propensity score matching techniques and household survey data to estimate the effect of the Internet on wages in Colombia, a countiy that has experienced a relatively rapid diffusion of information and communications technology in recent years. The empirical results confirm that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between Internet use and income in this countiy. Consistent with evidence gathered on developed countries in previous studies, the empirical results also suggest that workers in the middle of the skill distribution receive the lowest wage premium for using the Internet. However, contrary to most evidence from developed countries, low-skilled workers in Colombia enjoy the highest wage premium from Internet use, which illustrates the potential for new technologies to address inequality gaps between occupations.","[Martin, Diego A.] CAF Dev Bank Latin Amer, Res Dept, Caracas, Venezuela",,"Martin, DA (通讯作者)，CAF Dev Bank Latin Amer, Res Dept, Caracas, Venezuela.",dmartin@caf.com,,,,,,,54,1,1,1,4,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Dana et al.

Our binary trust game closely follows their design. Only a preceding stage (safe outside option vs. enter the game) is added in order to introduce reciprocity. We find significantly lower rates of selfish choices in the trust baseline in comparison to our treatments that feature moral wiggle room manipulations and a dictator baseline. It seems that reciprocal behavior is not only due to people liking to reciprocate but also because they feel obliged to do so.","[Regner, Tobias] Univ Jena, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Regner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Jena, Germany.",tobias.regner@uni-jena.de,"Regner, Tobias/AAQ-8945-2020","Regner, Tobias/0000-0002-6023-9094","Max Planck Institute of Economics, Jena, Germany","Max Planck Institute of Economics, Jena, Germany","I would like to thank audiences at the University of Louvain-La-Neuve, University of Giessen, University of Grenoble, at the International Max Planck Research School 'Uncertainty' workshop in Jena, at the Arne Ryde Workshop on ' Identity, Image and Economic Behavior' in Lund and at the esa meeting in Bergen for their feedback.

We find that although the poor as a whole are likely to have higher levels of participation compared to the non-poor, program participation is regressive among the poor. The poorest households are less likely to purchase Raskin rice over the course of a year, and, conditional on participation, they are likely to purchase lower quantities of rice, they purchase rice with lower frequency and they have lower participation relative to the number of community distributions.

Focusing on a duopoly market, we demonstrate that if the market is tight (or if the relative size of demand to supply exceeds a threshold value) and if the cost differential between firms is reasonably large, duopoly firms choose to engage in price competition.

Although the model is often used in the literature to scrutinize whether this effect exists, a flaw intrinsic to this model is the appearance of multicollinearity. In this study, I introduced novel techniques, namely: the standardization and estimation of a simple slope, to estimate the model. The results are as follows. First, I prove that the multicollinearity problem can be resolved by standardization. Second, externality, which is judged to conventionally exist, is not found.

While the literature suggests that an abundance of natural resources may have deleterious effects on fiscal decentralization and other variables, existing empirical evidence regarding expenditure decentralization is scant and suspect. We find that expenditure decentralization is highly persistent. We take this persistence into account and use four different estimation strategies to examine whether natural resource revenues influence expenditure decentralization. Increases in natural resource rents as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) statistically significantly and negatively affect expenditure decentralization. A 1% year-on-year increase in natural resource rents reduces estimated expenditure decentralization by approximately 0.1% to 0.3%. This result is robust to an alternative measure of resource dependence. Our findings strongly suggest that increases in resource endowments lead to a centralization of government expenditures.

The model explicitly allows for the interaction and substitution between fossil fuels, defined as a non-renewable resource derived from some fixed initial stock, and alternative energy, defined as renewable resource whose production requires capital input. The dynamics of the model depict a unique balance growth to a steady state. The saddle path of consumption temporarily peaks, when fossil fuels are plentiful and cheap, followed by a fall, as fossil fuel become more scarce and alternative energy production has yet to take over, until finally the steady state is reached where alternative energy production fuels the entire economy. The model demonstrates the dynamic substitution of depleting fossil fuel with renewable alternative energy such as to mitigate the negative consequences on growth and welfare of an ever-depleting fuel source in an energy dependent economy. Alternative energy and its potential productivity growth relative to fossil fuels also extends the period of low extraction rates and thereby keeping the finite resource in the ground for longer. The analysis is based on continuous time dynamic simulations that allow for the explicit consideration of transitional dynamics. In particular, the approach highlights the possible short run and medium run non-monotonic paths of consumption, investment and growth, whose analysis are necessarily lost when considering either the steady state equilibrium or deviations from it.","[Barreto, Raul A.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Barreto, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",raul.barreto@adelaide.edu.au,"Barreto, Raul/AAX-5309-2020","Barreto, Raul/0000-0001-8578-5131",,,,,24,87,93,19,84,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The Autoregressive Distributed Lag bounds testing approach of cointegration is used to test for the long run relation between the two variables, where the daily stock market index return is calculated using the first difference in the natural logarithms of stock market index. Further, we test for the stability of the cointegration relationship by examining the sensitivity analysis where diagnostic tests for serial correlation (namely the Breusch-Godfrey serial correlations LM test) and cumulative sum of recursive residuals (CUSUM) are employed. Using daily data from January 3, 2000 to December 9, 2015, the findings suggest that there is long run integration between oil prices and stock returns series in which the daily oil price shocks have a negative impact on stock returns. The highly significant error correction coefficient indicates high rate of convergence to equilibrium. In addition, the Toda and Yamamoto (J Econom 66(2):225-250, 1995) Granger non-causality test indicates significant bidirectional causality between stock market returns and Brent nominal oil price, meanwhile there is unidirectional causality running from WTI oil price to stock market returns.

Since 2003, government policies have aimed to distribute more resources to less developed areas. Although this process is accompanied by a narrowing interregional income gap, it does not represent real convergence between regions. From the perspective of spatial-political economics, the free movement of people is helpful to realize regional economic balance through agglomeration, while investment policies that deviate from the comparative advantage of less developed regions may lead to spatial misallocation of resources and unsustainable economic growth. In order to achieve further integration and development in the Chinese economy in the future, restrictions to the flow of production factors must be alleviated so that the market can truly become a decisive force for the allocation of resources.","[Liu, Yali; Lu, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Kuanhu] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University,"Xiang, KH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",liuyali.liu@sjtu.edu.cn; luming1973@sjtu.edu.cn; khxiang1986@163.com,,,Shanghai Institute of International Finance and Economics; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703097],Shanghai Institute of International Finance and Economics; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Yali Liu, PhD Candidate, Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.

A theory of endogenous development is a new scholarly contribution where firm and household production with education externalities and the endogeneity of new ideas leads to an optimal rate of development. This rate is higher than in an economy without these externalities. Since measures of private non-market and social benefit externalities are positive, externalities contribute to higher per capita development. The total return is estimated to be considerably higher than the opportunity cost of funds and the return on physical capital, the first major evidence of serious underinvestment in higher education in the US for optimal development. Policy-relevant treatment effects and policy options with implications for optimal development and for improving the worsening condition of the dissatisfied middle class are considered.

The efficient organization depends on the relative elasticity in the supply between the two sides of the market, the costs of participating in the market and organizing trade, and the (a) symmetry in matching. We also show that the social optimum can be implemented by a realistic market equilibrium where the organizers set up trading sites to direct the other side's search. The results provide a unified explanation for why trade has often been organized by sellers in the goods market, by buyers (firms) in the labor market, and by both sides in the asset market. The analysis also sheds light on how the efficient market organization can change with innovations such as e-commerce and just-in-time production.","[Shi, Shouyong] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Quebec, CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Shi, SY (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,Pennsylvania State University,Pennsylvania State University,We thank an editor and four referees for helpful comments that improved the article significantly.

Wang and Wright (2017) show how by preventing showrooming, a narrow PPC can reduce search costs and benefit consumers under between-platform competition. In response to having to give up its wide PPC to hotels, Booking.com emphasized its best price guarantee (BPG) to customers. We observe that a narrow PPC combined with a (low hassle costs) BPG leaves only Wang and Wright's Price Parity and Monopoly Equilibrium (PPME), in which consumers are worse off than with no platform operating at all. A more-efficient (incumbent) platform can deter entry with the BPG, while the narrow PPC eliminates competition from direct sales channels. An equally-efficient platform could enter and compete consumer prices down because of the existence of hassle costs, yet this equilibrium is fragile to network effects. If sellers have incentives not to price differentiate between platform(s) and their direct sales channel, a narrow PPC alone suffices to sustain the PPME in both cases. The detrimental pricing contract combination that we point out calls for different platform competition policy. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use both proprietary and commercial data on individual euro area bank balance-sheets and market prices. Our results show that a monetary policy easing - a decrease in short-term interest rates and/or a flattening of the yield curve - is not associated with lower bank profits once we control for the endogeneity of the policy measures to expected macroeconomic and financial conditions. Accommodative monetary conditions asymmetrically affect the main components of bank profitability, with a positive impact on loan loss provisions and non-interest income offsetting the negative one on net interest income. A protracted period of low monetary rates has a negative effect on profits that, however, only materializes after a long time period and is counterbalanced by improved macroeconomic conditions.

ABMs, as a form of artificial cliometrics, allow the analysis of the effects of the reactivity of firms caught in out-of-equilibrium conditions conditional on the levels of endogenous knowledge externalities stemming from the levels of knowledge connectivity of the system. The simulation results confirm the powerful effects of endogenous knowledge externalities. At the micro-level, the reactions of firms caught in out-of-equilibrium conditions yield successful effects in the form of productivity enhancing innovations, only in the presence of high levels of knowledge connectivity and strong pecuniary knowledge externalities. At the meso-level, the introduction of innovations changes the structural characteristics of the system in terms of knowledge connectivity that affect the availability of knowledge externalities. Endogenous centrifugal and centripetal forces continually reshape the structure of the system and its knowledge connectivity. At the macro system level, an out-of-equilibrium process leads to a step-wise increase in productivity combined with non-linear patterns of output growth characterized by significant oscillations typical of the long waves in Schumpeterian business cycles.","[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Econ, Turin, Italy; [Antonelli, Cristiano; Ferraris, Gianluigi] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dipartimento Econ, Turin, Italy.;Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK, Turin, Italy.",cristiano.antonelli@unito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023","Antonelli, Cristiano/0000-0002-5652-0510","European Commission DG Research, as part of the Cooperation Programme/Theme8/Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH), of the Collegio Carlo Alberto [266959]; University of Torino project IPER","European Commission DG Research, as part of the Cooperation Programme/Theme8/Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH), of the Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Torino project IPER","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the European Commission DG Research under Grant Number 266959 for the 'Policy Incentives for the Creation of Knowledge: Methods and Evidence' (PICK-ME) project, as part of the Cooperation Programme/Theme8/Socio-economic Sciences and Humanities (SSH), of the Collegio Carlo Alberto, and the University of Torino project IPER.",,51,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

None has been successful, essentially because one cannot have global taxes without a global government. This paper first reviews some major global taxes that have been proposed and then considers whether experience in two other spheres in which countries deal with each other to resolve fiscal questionsthe financing of international organizations and international taxation (how national taxes deal with cross-border flows)offers any lessons about the feasibility of a global tax. Since countries have little appetite for giving up fiscal sovereignty or for explicitly redistributive fiscal arrangements, most past global tax proposals had little or no prospect of success. But less ambitious attempts to develop a more global' approach to taxation through a transparent process that involves most who are affected, provides them some demonstrable benefit to all, and remains firmly under national control may perhaps over time move us a bit closer toward achieving the better world that global tax proponents presumably wish to achieve.","[Bird, Richard M.] Univ Toronto, 1065 Stockwell Ave, Mississauga, ON L5H 1B5, Canada",University of Toronto,"Bird, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 1065 Stockwell Ave, Mississauga, ON L5H 1B5, Canada.",rbird@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Bird, Richard/AAI-3656-2020","Bird, Richard/0000-0001-8164-4331; Bird, Richard/0000-0003-0382-3099",,,,,173,4,4,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

For this reason, the following paper will investigate the out-of-sample performance of seven individual forecasting models. The results show that it is possible to construct better forecasts compared to a no-change benchmark for horizons up to 24 months with gains in the MSPE ratio as high as 25%. In addition, some of the existing models will be extended, e.g. the U.S. inventories model by introducing more suitable real-time measures for the Brent crude oil price and the VAR model of the global oil market by using different measures for the economic activity. Furthermore, the time performance investigated by constructing recursively estimated MSPE ratios discovers potential weaknesses of the used models. Hence, several different combination approaches are tested with the goal of demonstrating that a combination of individual models is beneficial for the forecasting performance. Thereby, a combination consisting of four models has proven to have a lower MSPE ratio than the best individual models over the medium run and, in addition, to be remarkably stable over time.

We show that defection among racially conservative whites explains the entire decline from 1958 to 1980. Racial attitudes also predict whites' earlier partisan shifts.

The rule lowered risk weights, and therefore commercial bank holding company capital requirements, to 0.2 for holdings of AAA- and AA-rated private label securitization tranches, created by investment banks and securitizing commercial bank holding company subsidiaries; risk weights for A-rated holdings equaled 0.5. The rule's aim was to encourage securitization, but not risk-taking. Regulators indicated that the rule would apply to larger holding companies, without identifying them. Using bank holding companies with subsidiaries that commented on the proposed rule-makings as a treatment variable, average treatment effects from a fully flexible difference-in-differences model indicate that treated banks increased their holdings of the highly rated tranches relative to total assets, while other holding companies, on average, did not. Holding companies with greater highly rated tranche holdings also experienced greater increases in risk after Q1 2008, which suggests that poor performance may have been unanticipated.","[Miller, Stephen Matteo] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd,4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",George Mason University,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 3434 Washington Blvd,4th Floor, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",smiller@mercatus.gmu.edu,,"Miller, Stephen/0000-0002-6092-8420",,,,,26,5,6,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Our model accounts for several important institutional features of the labor market for lawyers, including differences in the work hours across occupational tracks and learning about the prospects of promotion to partner. Some female students need to take on large amounts of student debt to finance their education and hence start their careers with large amounts of negative wealth. The empirical findings suggest that student debt has negative effects on marriage prospects, career prospects, and investments in educational quality of female lawyers. The analysis also provides new insights into the design of public policies that aim to increase public sector employment.

Using a novel instrumental variable (IV) set based on the institutional environment unique to rural China, we find the point estimates of returns to lie within the range of 7.8%-10.7% for each additional year of schooling. Whilst our estimates are slightly higher than those reported for this cohort of workers in the literature, they are significantly lower than those enjoyed urban dwellers. Furthermore, we identify a wider gap in schooling returns between male (14.7%) and female (8.5%) migrant workers than the comparable gap for urban dwellers. Our results provide another line of evidence supporting a segmented labor market in urban China and remain robust to different estimators and under various IV restrictions. We suggest that improving the education system in the rural areas and eliminating the gender gap among migrant workers represent the necessary steps for enhancing social harmony in the Chinese society.","[Chen, George S.] Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Yao, Yao] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaojun] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",University of New England; Curtin University; City University of Hong Kong; Macquarie University,"Chen, GS (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",yaoyao@cityu.edu.hk; george.chen@une.edu.au; Ruhul.Salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au; orlandoyu@outlook.com,"Chen, George S/F-6658-2019; Chen, George/IAM-3609-2023","Chen, George S/0000-0002-8519-9340; Yao, Yao/0000-0002-9939-3494; Yu, xiaojun/0000-0003-0943-1782",,,,,57,7,7,0,40,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

In this article, we use a computational linguistic approach to extract the uncertainty tone emerging from media coverage of ECB's policy decisions during the period 1999M01-2014M08, the Media Uncertainty Index (MUI). We then relate the MUI to the interest rate setting procedure of the ECB. Our results suggest that the monetary institution implements an accommodative (restrictive) monetary policy in response to an increase (decrease) of the degree of uncertainty expressed by the media. Additional extensions show that (i) the ECB is more responsive to the uncertainty captured by the MUI in the pre-crisis era, while in the post-crisis era the ECB is more concerned by the uncertainty of the overall economic environment, as captured by the Economic Policy Uncertainty index (Baker et al., 2016) and that (ii) it (also) reacts to media's expressed uncertainty through its unconventional policy measures. Our findings shed some new light on the decision-making process of the ECB when it has to deal with the uncertainty ensuing from its past policy decision and the uncertainty of the overall economic environment, and thus, address an important issue related to the political economy of central banking.","[Bennani, Hamza] Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France",,"Bennani, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",h.bennani@parisnanterre.fr,"Bennani, Hamza/AAA-7967-2022; Bennani, Hamza/AAF-6997-2021","Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897; Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897",,,,,56,6,6,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Policies that provide income support to households potentially reduce entry into foster care via reducing child maltreatment and improving child behavior. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 (ARRA2009), the federal government expanded the earned income tax credit (EITC), which is an important income support program for low-income working households. Using state-level data, we investigate the impact of this EITC expansion on state-level foster care entry rates. Typically, states with state-level EITC match federal EITC spending at a specific rate, meaning that increases in federal EITC spending increase state-level spending as well. We find that expansion of EITC decreased foster care entry rates by 7.43% per year in states with a state-level EITC, relative to those without. In models that separately examine foster care entry rates by age of the child, we find that the ARRA2009 had different effects on foster care entry based on the child's age. We find that ARRA2009 decreased foster care entry rates for children age 11-15 by nearly 12% in states with a state EITC and it decreased foster care entry rates for children age 16-20 by roughly 17% in states with a state EITC, relative to states without a state EITC.","[Biehl, Amelia M.] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2303 Lutgert Hall, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA; [Hill, Brian] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Gulf Coast University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Biehl, AM (通讯作者)，Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 2303 Lutgert Hall, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA.",abiehl@fgcu.edu; bchill@salisbury.edu,,"Hill, Brian/0000-0002-9671-0853",,,,,20,18,20,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Our analysis finds that during an ongoing process of commercialization the company recorded steady improvements in economic performance measured by both labour and total factor productivity. This trend of improvement ended in 2007 mainly due to the wider economic recession and increased levels of indirect competition from sources including electronic substitution of traditional mail. Looking forward, the scope for further improvements in productivity appears limited due to indirect competition and the requirement to provide a universal service.

In our analysis we simulate a competitive benchmark based on estimated marginal costs, startup costs and opportunity costs of thermal and hydro plants. We compare the differences between the self-commitment for the period 2006-2009 and the competitive benchmark to the differences between the bid-based centralized unit commitment and the competitive benchmark after the transition. Based on these comparisons we estimate changes in deadweight losses due to misrepresentation of cost by bidders and dispatch inefficiency. The results suggest that centralized unit commitment has improved economic efficiency, reducing the relative deadweight loss by at least 3.32%. This result could in part be explained by the observation that, before 2009, there was an underproduction of thermal energy relative to the competitive benchmark and it supports the claim that dispatch efficiency has improved after the transition.

We base our study on the intersection of the basins of attraction of locally stable pure Nash equilibria for replicator and best-response dynamics. Local stability implies that the basin of attraction has positive measure but there are examples where the intersection of the basin of attraction for replicator and best-response dynamics is arbitrarily small. We provide conditions, involving the existence of an unstable interior Nash equilibrium, for the basins of attraction of any locally stable pure Nash equilibrium under replicator and best-response dynamics to intersect in a set of positive measure. Hence, for any choice of initial conditions in sets of positive measure, if a pure Nash equilibrium is locally stable, the outcome of learning under either procedure coincides. We provide examples illustrating the above, including some for which the basins of attraction exactly coincide for both learning dynamics. We explore the role that indifference sets play in the coincidence of the basins of attraction of the stable Nash equilibria.","[Castro, Sofia B. S.

Keeping fixed the structural parameters, the Ramsey government achieves efficient labor market volatility; doing so requires labor-income tax volatility that is orders of magnitude larger than the tax-smoothing results based on Walrasian labor markets, but a few times smaller than the results based on search and matching markets. We analytically characterize selection-model-consistent wedges and inefficiencies in order to understand optimal tax volatility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach differs from the general literature, which analyzes the effects of a commodity boom or bust and therefore the solutions in terms of economic policy separately, that is, by type of commodity. The stabilization strategy that we propose considers a key fact affecting many open economies, namely, that they not only are affected by increases or decreases in commodity prices, but also benefit from them. Consequently, we use a structural model for an open economy with restricted households to show that welfare could be improved with a fiscal rule incorporating transfers to stabilize household consumption. This strategy noticeably dominates an aggressive monetary policy focused only on stabilizing inflation and a fiscal policy that has an excessive bias toward saving income from exports.

In economics, the impact of technological progress on labour markets is understood by the following two channels: (i) the nature of interactions between differently skilled workers and new technologies affecting labour demand and (ii) the equilibrium effects of technological progress through consequent changes in labour supply and product markets. The paper explains how the ongoing Digital Revolution is characterized by a complex interplay between worker skills and digital capital in the workplace, and consequent changes in job mobility for workers and in output prices affecting consumer demand for goods and services. In particular, it explains how current worker-technology interactions and the equilibrium effects they entail combine to create economy-wide job polarization with winners and losers from ongoing technological progress. The paper therefore concludes by discussing a set of policy interventions to ensure that the benefits of the Digital Revolution are broadly shared.","[Goos, Maarten] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Goos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.goos@uu.nl,,,,,,,44,27,32,14,106,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In the second period, we show that firms offer discounts to new customers in a market where there are more inertial consumers with large switching costs, while firms offer discounts to past customers in a market where there are more variety-seeking consumers with large staying costs. If in the second period of our model there exist both inertial consumers and variety seeking consumers, horizontal product differentiation is minimized and both firms locate at the center of the Hotelling line market. Furthermore, when consumers are relatively sophisticated (forward-looking), behavior-based price discrimination (BBPD) hurts firms' profits as shown in the previous literature. However, when consumers are sufficiently naive (or myopic) and do not care much about the second period when making first-period decisions, we find that BBPD can be profitable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The paper uses a unique Georgian firm-level dataset, in which firm characteristics and output dynamics are matched with their customs export transactions, for the period 2006-2012. We adopt a discrete survival model to explore the role of firm-level characteristics, diversification strategies and network effects on the survival rates of export flows. Low survival rates at the product level limit the ability of Georgian firms to consolidate new products in international markets. The analysis finds that it is production efficiency, rather than size, that boosts export survival chances, that firms' diversification strategies matter for the prospects of survival, and that there is strong evidence of network effects in export survival. We also find that ratified foreign trade agreements contribute to increase the survival of export flows by reducing policy-induced trading costs and increasing information about destination markets.","[Martuscelli, Antonio] Univ Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Varela, Gonzalo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Naples Federico II; The World Bank,"Martuscelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Federico II, Naples, Italy.",antonio.martuscelli@unina.it,,"Varela, Gonzalo/0000-0001-9326-8417",,,,,27,7,9,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

In this paper, it is argued that a reverse causal relationship between corruption and income inequality might exist. We claim that income inequality could in fact be responsible for fostering corruption, which may be a reaction to a perceived unfair income distribution. Looking at a panel of 50 countries from 1995-2015, we show that the direction of causality between corruption and income inequality is country-specific and may be bidirectional. Using a dynamic GMM model, we robustly find that income inequality positively affects corruption, while corruption does not appear to be significant in the determination of income inequality, therefore contradicting the existing empirical literature on this topic.

Information on whether a time series is a pure noise or has a short or long range memory is important for predictive modeling of the series and analyzing its relationship with other variables. Existing studies on time series memory of stock variables are limited to price, volume, returns and conditional variance of returns. We carry out an in-depth analysis to understand the dependence structure of stock's investor attention time series (IATS) for energy market. In this process, we first investigate the existence of correlated dependence in IATS and analyze its dynamics using detrended fluctuation analysis. Further, we check how this dependence changes a) with frequency of sampled data b) during volatility clustering periods of price and volume of underlying stocks. Finally, we perfom detrended cross correlation analysis on local and global IATS to find any cross correlation dependence between the two. We use relative search query volume in Google to quantify IATS for a particular stock and analyze top 20 energy companies based on their market capitalization. The obtained detrended fluctuation coefficients for stock's IATS differ significantly from 0.5 indicating the existence of memory in the series. The dynamics of this memory exhibits persistent and mean reverting behavior. We also observed a reasonably high positive cross correlation dependence between local and global IATS. Finally we find that volatility clustering has little effect on dependence structure of investor attention time series. We also include a few examples to illustrate practical implications of these results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data for 230 municipalities that spans the years 2001-2014, this paper examines the impacts of family benefits on the fertility rate in Korea. I use the fact that different municipalities began providing the family benefits at different times to estimate the impact of family benefits on fertility rates using a difference-in-differences approach. This study finds a positive effect of family benefits on total fertility rate. Moreover, it finds little evidence of an anticipatory response within municipalities that adopted the policy. Given that a 10 million Korean won increase in family benefits is associated with a 3.5% increase in the total fertility rate, an increase in family benefits of about 44 million Korean won per child would be required to raise the total fertility rate to a safe zone above 1.5 children per woman, where population declines are gradual and easily reversed.","[Son, Yeon Jeong] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, M-C 144,601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Son, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, M-C 144,601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",yson8@uic.edu,,,,,,,29,9,12,8,53,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Second, during the 2008-15 U.S. ZLB period, the Fed was not very constrained in its ability to influence medium- and longer-term interest rates and the economy. And third, the risks of the Fed being significantly constrained by the ELB in the future are typically greatly overstated.

The fundamental cause of the US trade deficit is its persistent saving deficiency. China has complied with WTO commitments, although there remains significant room for improvement. The case against China for the so-called unfair acquisition of foreign technologies and cyber-enabled intellectual property rights theft is weak at best, although China needs to redouble its effort in protecting intellectual property rights.

In this work, we propose a novel extension of the multi-factor energy input-output model to support evidence-informed energy policy-making and green growth planning through the introduction of eight different multipliers and two green growth indexes. We demonstrate the approach through application at the national scale in Canada. In particular, we quantitatively assess the extent to which changes in final demand impact the domestic and imported primary (and renewable) energy flows, CO2 emissions, economic expansion, and energy job earnings. The results point to a potential path of green growth in Canada, prioritizing activities that generate economic and job growth at minimal environmental pressure (i.e., fewer CO2 emissions). Economic activities that are critical for stimulating green growth in the short to medium run are identified, and recommendations are made regarding a longer structural change path for improving the supply chains of other economic activities. This work provides insights to decision-makers seeking strategies (e.g., policy reforms or targeted public expenditure strategies) to accelerate green growth planning on a national scale.

Household' demands are modeled as a two-stage QUAIDS. After estimating price and expenditure elasticities, and the pass-through parameter associated with the reform, our results show that the individual welfare loss and the increment in the tax bill increase, but less than proportionately, with income. Consequently, the reform can be considered as regressive. Relating the effects of the VAT reform to households' incomes also implies a low quantitative effect, because of the low proportion of total household expenditure that cultural expenditure represents. From a social perspective, the size of the induced welfare loss would positively depend on society's inequality aversion. Regardless of the latter, it cannot be concluded whether the reform would have increased or reduced inequality in the distribution of cultural spending. Our results prove qualitatively robust to alternative values of the pass-through parameter.","[Garcia-Enriquez, Javier] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econometria & Estadist 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Echevarria, Cruz A.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"García-Enríquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econometria & Estadist 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",javier.garcia@ehu.eus; cruz.echevarria@ehu.eus,"Echevarria, Cruz/E-6557-2019; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/A-5945-2015","Echevarria, Cruz/0000-0003-2795-1917; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/0000-0002-2160-0369","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Fund of Regional Development [ECO2015-64467-R, ECO2016-76884-P]; Basque Government [DEUI-IT-793-13, DEUI-IT-783-13]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Fund of Regional Development; Basque Government(Basque Government),This study was funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Fund of Regional Development (Grant Numbers ECO2015-64467-R and ECO2016-76884-P (MINECO/FEDER)) and by the Basque Government (Grant Numbers DEUI-IT-793-13 and DEUI-IT-783-13).,,68,8,8,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The ETLA model can be labelled as a structural econometric macro model (also known as SEM or policy model in the recent literature). The ETLA model constitutes of 81 endogenous and 70 exogenous variables and hence at this stage, it is relatively small in size. The model encompasses Keynesian features in the short run, albeit particular attention is paid to its long-term equilibrium properties which are defined from supply side. Owing to these characteristics, its adjustment to external/policy shocks resembles the behavior of New Keynesian DSGE models with sticky prices and wages. The agents of the model are partly forward-looking.","[Lehmus, Markku] Res Inst Finnish Econ ETLA, Helsinki, Finland",,"Lehmus, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Finnish Econ ETLA, Helsinki, Finland.",markku.lehmus@etla.fi,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Our aim is to inform building managers, environmental consultants, and social scientists on the effectiveness of low-cost, easy-to-implement interventions aimed at reducing energy waste and carbon emissions in a setting where individuals do not have direct financial gain and have low awareness of the environmental impact of their actions. The interventions consist of three types of emails with different information content aimed at encouraging recipients not to leave the windows of their office open overnight or during weekends. Our results show that these interventions are effective in promoting energy savings, as the percentage of windows left open by treated occupants is typically halved compared to a control group. We find that the impact of the treatment is stronger when we provide specific information about the energy waste of the building where the email recipients work or when we show them how their behaviour differs from that of their peers. Moreover, our results show that positive behavioural changes are still observed a few weeks after the interventions are terminated, thus suggesting that such interventions do not act only as temporary cues which are easily forgotten by recipients.

We collect detailed sales data in Rutherford County, Tennessee over a seven-year time period and conduct a field experiment that randomly assigns specific cookie booths to receive a charitable bonus contribution for purchases of the impure or pure public good. The bonuses take several forms, which potentially affect warm-glow utility from a purchase, while holding the purchase price and utility from consumption constant. Matching donations are not only effective for increasing donations to charity (pure public good) but also generate spillovers for increasing cookie sales for consumption (impure public good). Charitable bonuses on individual varieties of cookies increase sales of those varieties. In our data, consumers are more sensitive to changes in the relative cost of pure donations to charity than they are to changes in the relative cost of charity associated with a cookie purchase.

Using kernel regressions, we show that the long-run path in the Polity index looks exactly like a transition curve. However, the literature lacks a short-run model that can generate this path. We note that the main political regime index is constant for most years. However, the stability is interrupted by infrequent jumps that are often quite large. We argue that periods of constancy represent political status quo equilibria that need to be broken by a triggering event. We find that such events occur randomly; they cannot be explained by economic variables. But if an event causes a change in the regime, the jump is normally in the direction of the transition curve. Hence, the curve acts as an attractor for the jumps. This is a new finding that integrates the short and the long run of the Democratic Transition.","[Paldam, Martin] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Gundlach, Erich] Univ Hamburg, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Gundlach, Erich] GIGA, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Aarhus University; University of Hamburg; German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Paldam, M (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",mpaldam@econ.au.dk; erich.gundlach@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,55,8,8,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2018,71.0,3,,,,,456,481,,10.1111/kykl.12177,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4RL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000440000700005,0

These reactors are now reaching 40 years of age, the end of their technological lifetime. This places France at an energy policy crossroads: should the reactors be retrofitted or should they be decommissioned? The cost-optimal decision depends on several factors going forward, in particular the expected costs of nuclear energy production, electricity demand levels and carbon prices, all of which are subject to significant uncertainty. To deal with these uncertainties, we apply the Robust Decision Making framework to determine which reactors should be retrofitted. We build an investment and dispatch optimization model, calibrated for France. Then we use it to study 27 retrofit strategies for all combinations of uncertain parameters, with nearly 8000 runs. Our analysis indicates that robust strategies involve the early closure of 10 to 20 reactors, while extending the life of all other reactors. These strategies provide a hedge against the risks of unexpected increases in retrofit costs, low demand and low carbon prices. Our work also highlights the vulnerabilities of the official French government scenarios, and complements them by suggesting new robust strategies. These results provide a timely contribution to the current debate on the lifetime extension of nuclear plants in France. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that allowing locations to vary over the game reduces cartel stability but that greater convexity continues to improve that stability. Moreover, when the degree of convexity does not support the first best collusive locations, other collusive locations exist that require less stability and these may either increase or decrease social welfare relative to competition. Critically, these locations that require less stability are more dispersed in sharp contrast to the known result assuming linear production costs.","[Andree, Kai; Schwan, Mike] Univ Potsdam, Dept Econ, Potsdam, Germany; [Heywood, John S.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Wang, Zheng] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",University of Potsdam; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Wang, Z (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",zwang46@163.com,,,,,,,29,6,6,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Ours is the first study to analyze the effect of own-unemployment on energy intake, energy expenditure, and the net effect (body mass index) using longitudinal records. Exploiting information enveloping the recent steep recession and prolonged recovery is valuable since recent job losers will modify their behavior little if they expect soon to be re-employed, whereas if they expect joblessness to last, they will adjust to a possibly prolonged decline in income and increase in nonwork time. We find that becoming unemployed is associated with a small increase in leisure-time exercise, a moderate decrease in smoking, and a substantial decline in total physical activity. We also find that unemployment and nonemployment are associated with a decline in purchases of fast food. Together, these results imply that both energy consumption and expenditure may decline in the United States during recessions, the net result being essentially no change in body weight. There is considerable heterogeneity in these effects across specific health behaviors, across the intensive and extensive margins, across the outcome distribution, and across gender.","[Colman, Gregory] Pace Univ, Dept Econ, 41 Pk Row, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Colman, Gregory] NBER, 41 Pk Row, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, NBER, Dept Econ, 175 Forest St,AAC 195, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Inst Labor Econ IZA, 175 Forest St,AAC 195, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] NBER, 175 Forest St,AAC 195, Waltham, MA 02452 USA",Pace University; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research; Bentley University; Bentley University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Colman, G (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, Dept Econ, 41 Pk Row, New York, NY 10038 USA.;Colman, G (通讯作者)，NBER, 41 Pk Row, New York, NY 10038 USA.",gcolman@pace.edu; ddave@bentley.edu,,,,,,,43,15,15,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

This paper identifies a strategic effect between price-takers and non-price-takers on financial markets. It results from the liquidity reduction non-price-taking induces. Thus, a trade-off between the benefits of calculating price impacts correctly and market liquidity exists. It is shown that price-takers may benefit more from trading than their fully rational counterparts do. Moreover, it is demonstrated that when the choice of behavior is unobservable and decision costs exist an investor would profit more as a non-price-taker when his trading potential is large, and more as a price-taker when it is small. However, when the choice of behavior is observable it is the other way around. If various rounds of trading take place, an investor's terminal endowment converges to his risk tolerance share. Thus, an efficient allocation is obtained. Furthermore, a paradox concerning the endogenous choice of manners of calculation is identified.","[Hirth, Hans; Walther, Martin] Tech Univ Berlin, Finance & Investment, Sec H 64,Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Walther, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Finance & Investment, Sec H 64,Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",hans.hirth@tu-berlin.de; martin.walther@tu-berlin.de,,"Walther, Martin/0000-0003-4713-0446",,,,,16,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Analyzing bilateral migrant stocks of the 15 main destination countries and 85 sending countries for the year 2000, we find that migrant selection and genetic distance follow a nonlinearJ-shaped pattern: at low levels of genetic distance, increases in genetic distance reduce the positive selection of migration. However, at higher levels of genetic distance, this pattern is reversed and migration becomes more positively selected. We complement this finding by showing that the net benefits of genetic distance are strongly decreasing for low-skilled migrants with increasing genetic distance, while high-skilled migrants are less responsive to genetic distance in general. Results are robust to conditioning on bilateral control variables, including various destination- and sending-country-specific fixed effects and applying an instrumental-variables approach that exploits exogenous variation in genetic distances in the year 1500.

Attending to GVC, certain regions have the decision power to coordinate the productive and technological innovation. This spatial model is dynamic and it is thus possible to modify the initial status of a region within GVC. This paper aims to analyse the keys in the evolution of Mexico in the auto-parts sector from the GVC perspective, focusing on the development of home companies and the role of institutions. Methodology: The methodology combines a qualitative and quantitative analysis to compare key variables from domestic firms and institutions belonging to a Mexican region (el Bajio) and a Spanish region with an intermediate status in the GVC (North-west region). Results: The multinationalization degree of Mexican companies, understood as the presence of leading domestic multinationals in the industry, is lower than in the Spanish region. Furthermore, Mexican domestic companies' show activities with lower added value and complexity, and they are mostly simple suppliers of components or raw materials and therefore are not in the first levels of supply within the GVC. This reduces the technological innovation and it causes a scarce diversification of knowledge in the Mexican region, with competencies and capabilities comparatively simpler than in the Spanish one. Conclusions: The multinationalization and the technological innovation capacity of domestic companies are a key for Mexico to evolve within the automobile GVC. Regarding institutions, the improvement of some innovation infrastructures in terms of performance, and a better definition of public policies towards the multinationalization and the promotion of technological innovation in domestic companies can favour the evolution of Mexico within the GVC.","[Lampon, Jesus F.; Cabanelas, Pablo] Univ Vigo, Dept Org Empresas & Mkt, Vigo, Spain; [Delgado Guzman, Jose Alfredo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Contaduria & Adm, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidade de Vigo; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Lampón, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Org Empresas & Mkt, Vigo, Spain.",jesus.lampon@uvigo.es; pcabanelas@uvigo.es; adelgado@fca.unam.mx,"Cabanelas, Pablo/E-9651-2016; Lampón, Jesús F./L-1093-2017","Cabanelas, Pablo/0000-0002-4661-0141; Lampón, Jesús F./0000-0001-9267-4448",,,,,50,14,15,0,15,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Indeed, we document that it is an important source of prolonged conflicts. We introduce a theoretical model of the balance of power to explain why this should be the case and to analyse how peace can be achieved: either a hot peace between hostile neighbours or the peace of the strong dominating the weak Non-intervention generally leads to peace after defeat of the weak. Hot peace can be achieved with sufficiently strong outside intervention. The latter is thus optimal if the goal of policy is to prevent the strong from dominating the weak.","[Levine, David K.] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Fiesole, FI, Italy; WUSTL, St Louis, MO USA; Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy",European University Institute; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Palermo,"Levine, DK (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Fiesole, FI, Italy.",,,,EUI Research Council; ADEMU,EUI Research Council; ADEMU,We gratefully acknowledge support from the EUI Research Council and ADEMU.,,19,2,2,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

This paper compares three occupations in the housing sector with very different wage setting institutions: real estate agents, architects and construction workers. I study the wage and employment responses of these occupations to the housing cycle, a proxy for labour demand shocks to the industry. The employment of real estate agents, whose pay is far more flexible than the other occupations, indeed reacts less to the cycle than employment in the other occupations, although specific estimates are noisy. I show that the aggregate implications of the estimates depend also on the aggregate labour demand elasticity, which captures how easily laid off workers can find employment in alternative sectors.","[Pischke, Jorn-Steffen] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Pischke, JS (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,"Pischke, Jorn-Steffen/0000-0002-6466-1874",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1]; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I thank Alexander Lembke, Georg Graetz and Felix Koenig for excellent research assistance, and two referees, Carol Jordan, Alan Manning, Guy Michaels, Albert Saiz and Orie Shelef for helpful comments.

The Knight-Pigou Debate Revisited,ECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-THEORY; MARKET PROVISION; CLUB GOODS; TRANSPORTATION; OWNERSHIP; NETWORKS; AIRPORT; ROADS; AREA,"This paper clarifies issues debated by A. C. Pigou and Frank Knight about correcting inefficient use of congestible resources, focusing for concreteness on their original example of road congestion. Instead of government-imposed Pigouvian access fees, Knight favoured access fees set by private toll-setters. We consider the case of n2 congestible roads and an uncongestible road of arbitrary speed. Knight argued that in the case of a single congestible road, a private toll-setter would always choose the toll that Pigou recommended, hence the allocation would minimize aggregate commute time without government meddling. We find instead that two or more toll-setters would never choose Pigouvian tolls except in the special case of a sufficiently fast uncongestible road. Moreover, for uncongestible roads of slower speed, the allocation of motorists under Knight's proposal is almost never efficient. Whenever it is inefficient, motorists are strictly worse off when they pay tolls set by private firms instead of paying government-imposed tolls, and aggregate toll revenue is also lower. Nevertheless, if the private sector does set tolls, then the full cost to motorists can be limited if the government provides an uncongestible alternative, such as a train, to offer potential competition along the same route.","[Salant, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Seegert, Nathan] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Salant, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Salant, Stephen/L-8398-2016","Salant, Stephen/0000-0001-5407-4572",,,,,47,4,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2018,85.0,339,,,,,428,448,,10.1111/ecca.12259,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI5LQ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000434412400002,0

In practice, however, centralized organizations can have its own inefficiencies and decentralized management can do relatively well. Empirically testing relative efficiency is difficult because distinct organizations emerge endogenously in various contexts. This paper, in contrast, draws upon the unique history of New Mexico, leveraging a natural experiment to assess how the partial transition in the early 20th century from the original small decentralized communal Spanish irrigation systems (acequias) to centralized quasi-public irrigation districts altered agricultural development and production. Surface water irrigators in arid regions confront public good issues for building and maintaining shared infrastructure as well as common-pool resource issues to appropriate the surface water. My results confirm that irrigation districts can significantly improve outcomes when investing in costly infrastructure to expand irrigated acreage, increasing farmland values up to 33%. However, I find no broader evidence that the centralized control of water distribution provides any gains to acreage previously under irrigation by the decentralized acequias. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing Middle Class Performance in Between 2000-2014,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,middle classes; poverty; latent-class models; vulnerability; security; Mexico,INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; INEQUALITY; WORLD,"Background: Middle class is a polysemic social category. In methodological terms, it is similar to that of poverty, both without consensus according to literature. A comprehensive review of literature is made in this paper, emphasizing on single and multidimensional methodologies, identifying non-consensual findings when using and building thresholds and different dimensions. Methodology: This paper proposes identification of Mexican Middle Class according to a multidimensional perspective, consistent with Coneval's multidimensional poverty measurement method (2009), where income is a necessary but not enough condition of security and none vulnerability. Latent-class models are built based upon the Coneval's Rights and Well-being indicators that identified the ratio of population that could be considered middle classes. Five categories are obtained: population in multidimensional poverty, vulnerable population by income, vulnerable population due to social deprivation, middle classes and rich population. Results: Among the main findings, there is evidence that Mexico continues to be a country of poor, rather than middle class people. The number of people in poverty is 2.3 times greater than that of middle class, while the status and conditions of life guaranteeing security and not economic vulnerability, characteristic of the middle class, is only due for a little more of a quarter of the total population, 27.5%. This paper presents findings on the evolution of the middle class, which grows between 2000-2006, before the food and economic-financial crisis of 2006 and 2008, but never reaches levels above 50%. After crisis years, it begins its descent again to levels similar to 1994, showing its vulnerability to economic crisis. Conclusions: As a conclusion sustainability of middle classes over time in Mexico depends both on an effective and efficient policy to fight against poverty, and on specific policy about middle classes, which actually in Mexico and Latin American countries does not exist. This means that the broadest layers of the population, in the same way as in developed countries, have access to a living wage that guarantees well-being, effective health services, quality education, access to the credit market and financial services, as well as adequate and dignified pension system.","[Teruel, Graciela; Reyes, Miguel] Univ Iberoamer, Puebla, Mexico; [Teruel, Graciela] Univ Iberoamer, Inst Invest Desarrollo Con Equidad, Equide, Puebla, Mexico; [Reyes, Miguel] Univ Iberoamer, Observ Salarios, Campus Ciudad Mexico & Puebla, Puebla, Mexico; [Minor, Enrique] Consejo Nacl Evaluac Polit Social Mexico Coneval, Anal & Diagnost, Puebla, Mexico; [Lopez, Miguel] Univ Iberoamer, Econ & Finanzas, Puebla, Mexico",,"Teruel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Iberoamer, Puebla, Mexico.;Teruel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Iberoamer, Inst Invest Desarrollo Con Equidad, Equide, Puebla, Mexico.",chele.teruel@ibero.mx; miguel.reyes@ibero.mx; eeminor@coneval.org.mx; miguelalejandro.lopez.lopez@iberopuebla.mx,,,,,,,82,2,2,3,11,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

It has been found that productivity may affect firms' decisions about engaging in import and F.D.I., while there is no evidence of such an effect regarding exports.

Specifically, we track wages for up to 20 years among women and men born in the years 1960-70 who completed a university degree in business or economics. These women and men have similar wages and earnings at the start of their careers, but their career paths diverge substantially as they age. These men and women also have substantial differences in wage paths associated with becoming a parent. We look at whether firm effects account for the differences we observe between women's and men's wage profiles. We document differences between the firms where men work and those where women work. However, a wage decomposition suggests that these differences in firm characteristics play only a small role in explaining the gender log wage gap among these workers. We then examine whether gender differences in firm-to-firm mobility help explain the patterns in wages that we see. Men and women both exhibit greater mobility early in their careers, but there is little gender difference in this firmto-firm mobility. We find that the main driver of the gender difference in log wage profiles is that men experience higher wage gains than women do both as switchers and as stayers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The indices capture not only the extent to which groups form well-defined strata in the income distribution but also the scale of the resultant differences in equally distributed equivalent incomes between them, where these two factors play the same role as identification and alienation respectively in the measurement of polarization. The properties of the class as a whole are investigated as well as those of selected members of it: zeroth and first power indices may be interpreted as measuring the overall incidence and depth of stratification respectively, while second and higher power indices members are directly sensitive to the severity of stratification between groups.

The 2006 reform increased learning and reduced earning as school participation rose post-reform, while teen employment fell. Empirical analysis of detailed administrative data reveals that criminal offending fell significantly after enactment of the reform. For males, violent, property and drug crime all declined, while the main effect for females was a significant fall in property crime. The property and drug crime falls are underpinned by a significant incapacitation effect, with some evidence of a persistent crime reduction for young men and women at later ages. Crime reduction resulting from the reform is concentrated in significant falls in the likelihood of ever offending by marginal individuals, rather than lower criminality of recalcitrant persistent offenders.

Many such services are provided by monopoly not-for-profit providers and there is concern that for-profit providers may increase profit at the expense of quality. This paper explores the implications of entry by for-profit providers when there is unobserved quality. The model generates three key policy relevant insights. First, by developing a novel approach to competition between different organizational forms, it frames the relevant trade-offs precisely. Second, it shows the value of keeping an incumbent not-for-profit as an active provider. Third, it characterizes the optimal payment (or voucher value) to an entrant for each consumer who switches in a way that can be applied empirically. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find both substantial gains from marriage and effects of relative predicted earnings outside of marriage on relative gains from marriage. These findings are consistent with cooperative bargaining models and with models viewing individuals as having a demand for household production services by a spouse, with market forces influencing the price of such services. In addition, we find that men benefit more from marriage than women and that this gender gap is more pronounced for older couples. This is likely to be due to social norms and prescribed gender roles which are more prevalent within the older generation.","[Bethmann, Dirk] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Rudolf, Robert] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Rudolf, R (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",rrudolf@korea.ac.kr,"Bethmann, Dirk/N-6816-2017","Rudolf, Robert/0000-0003-1956-0457",Korea University (KU); KU [K1509031],Korea University (KU); KU,"The authors thank the Editor and an unknown reviewer for their very helpful comments.

We find different responses to fluctuations and long-run growth, both heterogeneous over the life cycle. Fertility was procyclical but declined and delayed with long-run growth; fluctuations late (but not early) in the reproductive period affected lifetime fertility.

Under symmetric information, an efficient agent who is averse to inequity (i.e., suffering from being ahead) produces less than he does without peer pressure whereas an inefficient agent suffering from being behind produces more such that the output gap between the two types of agents is lessened. Moreover, overproduction in total output will occur if the inefficient agent's disadvantage inequity aversion is greater than that of the efficient agent's. However, as the information structure becomes asymmetric, the overproduction disappears because the information rent paid to the efficient agent becomes too burdensome so that it countervails the active peer pressure effect. These results are consistent with previous findings from empirical and experimental studies.","[Choi, Kangsik] Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Busandaehak Ro 63 Beon Gil 2, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Han, Jae-Joon; Lee, Minhwan] Inha Univ, Dept Global Finance & Banking, Incheon, South Korea",Pusan National University; Inha University,"Han, JJ (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Dept Global Finance & Banking, Incheon, South Korea.",choipnu@pusan.ac.kr; jjhan@inha.ac.kr; skymh@inha.ac.kr,"Choi, Kangsik/I-5231-2013",,Inha University Research Grant,Inha University Research Grant,We are especially indebted to two anonymous referees for careful and constructive comments.

Our estimates show that monetary policy has large spillover effects on house prices, however it has not been a major driver of house prices in New Zealand which have instead been driven by sector-specific shocks. We consider macroprudential policies, including the loan-to-value restrictions that have been implemented in New Zealand. We find that loan-to-value restrictions reduce house prices with negligible effects on consumer prices, suggesting they can be used without derailing monetary policy. Efficient policy frontier analysis suggests macroprudential policy is a useful addition to monetary policy, and the two do not need to be coordinated. We estimate that the loan-to-value restrictions imposed in New Zealand in 2013 reduced house prices by 3.8% and that greater forward guidance on their duration would have made them more effective.","[Funke, Michael; Mihaylovski, Petar] Hamburg Univ, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Kirkby, Robert] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand",University of Hamburg; Victoria University Wellington,"Kirkby, R (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand.",michael.funke@uni-hamburg.de; robert.kirkby@vuw.ac.nz; PetarValentinov.Mihaylovski@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,"Kirkby, Robert/0000-0002-8242-0513",,,,,56,20,22,0,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

We analysed Satisficing Theory, which is particularly useful when decision makers have to face the cognitive burden of complex decisions. Three principles of the theory are discussed noting that the third, partial pay-off functions, has not been addressed in the literature. We implement the three principles mathematically obtaining a discrete choice model in which the decision maker chooses the first satisfactory alternative. The model formulation is analytically derived, as well as its properties. The Stochastic Satisficing model allows variable or constant marginal rates of substitution and enables the explicit characterization of non-compensatory behaviours. The model can also explain attribute saturation and non-attendance of high order needs when basic needs are not fulfilled. We analysed the model performance on synthetic data, showing that it is likely to be unbiased and consistent for relatively common samples sizes. When tested on real data, the model proves its flexibility to also adapt to constant marginal rates of substitution. We conclude that the model is a good characterization of Satisficing behaviour for simple datasets.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev CEDEUS, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"González-Valdés, F (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile PUC, Av.Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile.",fagonzalezv@uc.cl,"Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/F-8277-2013","Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/0000-0003-3452-3574",Chilean Commission for Scientific and Technological Research [CONICYT 21151280]; Institute in Complex Engineering Systems [FONDECYT: FB8016]; Centre for Sustainable Urban Development - CEDEUS [Conicyt/Fondap/15110020],Chilean Commission for Scientific and Technological Research; Institute in Complex Engineering Systems; Centre for Sustainable Urban Development - CEDEUS,"We are grateful to the Chilean Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT 21151280) for having supported this research.

Asymptotically risk-loving preferences are both sufficient and necessary for unbounded profits.

We find that additions to the Islamic index lead to a positive stock market reaction in Muslim countries but a negative reaction in the US. Conversely, deletions from the Islamic index generate a negative stock market reaction in Muslim countries but a positive one in the US. The differing valuation effects can be explained by different perceptions of investors. In Muslim countries, investors have a positive perception of the Sharia compliance because of religious beliefs, while in the US they negatively react because of a negative perception of Islam and of the restrictions associated with Sharia compliance.","[Jaballah, Jamil] Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Peillex, Jonathan] Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, Paris, France; [Peillex, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne 10, CRIISEA, BP 2716, F-80027 Amiens 1, France; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France",Grenoble Ecole Management; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",jamil.jaballah@grenoble-em.com; jonathan.peillex@devinci.fr; laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,"Peillex, Jonathan/0000-0002-0286-9522",,,,,38,15,16,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Consistent with other developed economies, consumption inequality in Australia is lower on average than income inequality. Both have increased since the early 1990s, with income inequality increasing by more. We decompose the trend in income inequality into four components: (i) changes in observed household characteristics; (ii) changes in the returns to unobserved skills; (iii) changes in the size of persistent income shocks; and (iv) changes in the size of transitory income shocks. We find that changes in the size of persistent and transitory income shocks, rather than changes in observed household characteristics, explain most of this trend. Since the middle of the 2000s, the source of income inequality has shifted from transitory to persistent factors, which is consistent with the rise in consumption inequality over the corresponding period. We find that accounting for imputed rents lowers estimates of the level of inequality in Australia, but has a negligible effect on the trends.","[Kaplan, Greg] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kaplan, Greg] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kaplan, Greg] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [La Cava, Gianni; Stone, Tahlee] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Chicago; University of New South Wales Sydney; National Bureau of Economic Research; Reserve Bank of Australia,"Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gkaplan@uchicago.edu,"La Cava, Gianni/GXF-5173-2022","La Cava, Gianni/0000-0003-0128-372X",,,,,20,10,11,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

While employers wish to avoid associating with those who will end up returning to crime, they cannot be certain from the available information which convicts will reoffend and which will not. We illustrate that, notwithstanding this informational asymmetry, a government (or a civic society) can nevertheless design a costly, yet net socially beneficial program through which some ex-convicts can credibly convey their good intentions to employers. Such a rebranding program can help more ex-convicts find legitimate work, with fewer electing to return to crime than would otherwise have been the case.","[Kim, Young-Chul] Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 04107, South Korea; [Loury, Glenn C.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Sogang University; Brown University,"Kim, YC (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 04107, South Korea.",yckim@sogang.ac.kr; Glenn_Loury@brown.edu,,,,,,,15,4,4,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

However, there seem to be no theoretical studies supporting these reforms; either the two instruments are considered for all practical purposes equivalent, or the conclusion is in favor of deposit regulation. In our model there is a real tradeoff between the two: capital regulation is costly because the opportunity costs of capital are higher than the return from normal banking activities, while deposit rate ceilings may result in an inefficiently large number of banks. We show that, depending on the opportunity costs of banking capital and on the severity of the moral hazard problem they seek to address, each of the two regulatory instruments may welfare-dominate the other.","[Nielsen, Carsten Krabbe] Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Econ & Finance, Milan, Italy; [Weinrich, Gerd] Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Math Disciplines Math Finance & Econometr, Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Weinrich, G (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Math Disciplines Math Finance & Econometr, Milan, Italy.",gerd.weinrich@unicatt.it,,,Italian national research project Local interactions and global dynamics in economics and finance: models and tools; Catholic University's research project Teorie e modelli matematici per le scienze economiche [UCSC D.1]; Catholic University's research project The challenges of the crisis: Rethinking microeconomic and macroeconomic policies [UCSC D3.2],Italian national research project Local interactions and global dynamics in economics and finance: models and tools; Catholic University's research project Teorie e modelli matematici per le scienze economiche; Catholic University's research project The challenges of the crisis: Rethinking microeconomic and macroeconomic policies,"Financial support from the Italian national research project Local interactions and global dynamics in economics and finance: models and tools, PRIN-2009, and from the Catholic University's research projects Teorie e modelli matematici per le scienze economiche, UCSC D.1, and The challenges of the crisis: Rethinking microeconomic and macroeconomic policies, UCSC D3.2, is gratefully acknowledged.",,20,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We propose a DSGE model with purely forward-looking wage and price setters and parsimoniously chosen disturbances. Our model emphasizes an interplay between production firms networking and working capital. Firms can use working capital to finance all (or a fraction) of their outlays on production factors, and use the output of other firms as an input in a what is often called a roundabout production structure. Our model generates a response of inflation which is mute on impact of a monetary policy shock, but highly persistent and very hump-shaped afterwards. It also yields a large contract multiplier for output, two times larger than the one implied by a model relying on indexation only. We also show that the response of the price markup can be positive on impact of an expansionary monetary policy shock, which differs from the standard countercyclical markup channel emphasized in conventional New Keynesian models. In contrast to models relying on indexation to past inflation, our model produces non-inertial responses of inflation to productivity and investment shocks, a finding which is broadly consistent with the existing VAR evidence.

Employing a panel data regression framework, the study uses bank-level annual data from major commercial banks in Bangladesh for the period 1983-2012. Empirical results show financial reform has not had significant effect on the return on asset (ROA) or return on equity (ROE) for the banks, but the net interest margin (NIM) has increased. The results further indicate that capital strength and asset quality are the main drivers of profitability. Therefore, an appropriate banking policy aimed at raising capital base and asset quality is vital for ensuring a viable banking sector in Bangladesh.

Using six cycles of NPHS data (1998-2009), I explore Canada's obesity dilemma by considering the effect of economic insecuritymeasured as the probability of an individual experiencing a severe negative economic shock. As an identification strategy, a fixed effects model is employed to control for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity and a set of instruments based on an individual's economic environment are specified in order to isolate causality. Results suggest that for males age 25 to 64, a 1 percent increase in economic insecurity is predicted to increase their body mass index (BMI) by 0.10 points.

Arguably the primary driver for these standards is their use as a tool to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the electric sector. The cost-effectiveness of this mitigation approach relative to other policies is hotly disputed. In this paper, we use the US-REGEN model to evaluate the costs and CO2 emissions reductions of existing and potential renewable portfolio standards in the United States, and to compare these mandate-based policies to the least-cost resource portfolio that achieves equivalent CO2 reductions. We find that, in most cases, renewable portfolio standards are approximately twice as costly as the equivalent least-cost portfolio for achieving CO2 reductions, although the ratio can be much higher for standards with lower abatement. Furthermore, the effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards at reducing CO2 emissions depends strongly on future natural gas prices. Technology neutral instruments to achieve CO2 reductions usually replace existing coal generation with the cheapest alternative, given natural gas and CO2 prices. A mandate for renewables is higher cost both because renewable generation may not be the cheapest alternative to coal generation, and because adding renewable capacity often displaces non-coal generation on the margin when there is no CO2 price.

This implies complementarity between these two factors, but in most theoretical papers, substitutability is assumed. In this paper, the main question is if complementarity between energy and physical capital hampers balanced growth or not. In order to answer this question, we consider the simple economic growth model with two sectors - output production and energy production - where energy is complementary to physical capital. Two forms of capital - physical and human - are distributed in this model between two sectors to maximise output. We consider the equilibrium state of this model, analyse comparative statics and derive necessary conditions for balanced growth. We also analyse some of the effects of technological progress. The analysis brings us to the conclusion that, in general, it leads to an increase in output, but that changes in technology of production have an ambiguous influence on output. We also derive explicit paths of growth for all macroeconomic variables. We find that, in general, if the obtained conditions are fulfilled then complementarity is not an obstacle to economic growth, subject to our assumptions which are quite standard in this kind of research.","[Malaczewski, Maciej] Univ Lodz, Dept Econometr, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Malaczewski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Econometr, Lodz, Poland.",maciej.malaczewski@uni.lodz.pl,,"Malaczewski, Maciej/0000-0001-7798-2581",Faculty of Economics and Sociology of the University of Lodz,Faculty of Economics and Sociology of the University of Lodz,"The author would like to thank colleagues from Department of Econometrics, participants of the annual mathematical economics conference in Poznan and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

Even in developing countries, households have access to a wide array of new technologies. However, factors affecting households' technology adoption decisions remain poorly understood. Using data on solar microgrid adoption from rural India, we investigate the determinants of household technology adoption. We offer all households identical solar products to avoid bias from product differentiation. Households pay a monthly fee for technology use, allowing us to abstract away from credit constraints as a barrier to adoption. The results show that household expenditures and savings as well as the household head's entrepreneurial attitude are strong predictors of adoption. In contrast, past fuel expenditures, risk acceptance, and community trust are not associated with technology adoption decisions. These findings suggest new directions for research on the microeconomics of household technology adoption, which is critical for sustainable development among the poor in developing countries.

Two notable examples are the Long-Run Risk and rare disaster frameworks. Such models are difficult to characterize from consumption data alone. Accordingly, concerns have been raised regarding their specification. Acknowledging that both phenomena are naturally subject to ambiguity, we show that an ambiguity-averse agent may behave as if Long-Run Risk and disasters exist even if they do not or exaggerate them if they do. Consequently, prices may be misleading in characterizing these phenomena since they encode a pessimistic perspective of the data-generating process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since players are impatient, this delay is costly for everyone. We consider a unanimity bargaining game in which the proposer can strategically choose the length of this delay. We assume that the size of the surplus depends endogenously on the chosen length of the prospective delay. Intuitively, the proposer faces the following trade-off: The more he exploits his proposer power, the smaller is the surplus that can be divided. One interpretation is that aggressive bargaining tactics hurt the fruitful cooperation among players, and thus the surplus. We characterize stationary equilibrium strategies and payoffs, and obtain sharp predictions on the extent of surplus destruction, the size of the social loss, and the surplus allocation.

We generate a panel of attitudes in urban Pakistan, in which respondents are randomly exposed to fact-based statements describing the US in either a positive or negative light. Anti-American sentiment is high and heterogenous in our sample at the baseline, and systematically correlated with intended behavior (such as intended migration to the US). We find that revised attitudes are significantly different from baseline attitudes: attitudes are, on average, revised upward (downward) upon receipt of positive (negative) information, indicating that providing information had a meaningful effect on US favorability. The within-subject design and data on respondents' priors allows us to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We find that revisions are largely a result of salience-based updating. We reject unbiased information-based updating as the only source of revisions. In addition, a substantial proportion of individuals do not respond to the information. This heterogeneity in revision processes means that there is no convergence in attitudes following the provision of information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Competition, if unimpeded, should restore profits to normal levels within a relatively short time frame. The dynamics of profits can thus reveal a great deal about the competitiveness of an economy. This paper estimates the persistence of profits across the European Union (EU), which adds to our understanding of the competitiveness of 18 EU member states. By using a sample of approximately 4700 firms with 51,000 observations across the time period of 1995-2013, we find differences in the persistence of short-run profits, implying that there are differences in competitiveness across the EU. The Czech Republic and Greece are among the countries with the highest profit persistence, whereas the United Kingdom is among those with the lowest persistence of profits. Furthermore, we provide evidence that there are significant permanent rents present in the EU across countries as well as in the different broad sectors across the EU.","[Eklund, Johan E.; Lappi, Emma] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Grevgatan 34,3rd Floor, S-11453 Stockholm, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.] Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.; Lappi, Emma] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden",Blekinge Institute Technology; Jonkoping University,"Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Grevgatan 34,3rd Floor, S-11453 Stockholm, Sweden.;Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden.;Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden.",johan.eklund@entreprenorskapsforum.se; emma.lappi@entreprenorskapsforum.se,"Eklund, Johan/HPC-9141-2023; Lappi, Emma/AFS-7709-2022","Lappi, Emma/0000-0002-3950-931X",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg foundation; Mellby Gard AB,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg foundation; Mellby Gard AB,"We are grateful for the valuable comments from Dennis C.

We develop a model which incorporates costly search and costly return and demonstrate that appearing later may be better. When return is free, prominence is desirable by standard logic, however costly return induces a tradeoff - it benefits an earlier seller by reducing the initial search but also benefits a later seller by preventing return conditional on search. We show that for small search costs later is better whenever high outcomes have a low likelihood, or whenever two independent match value draws are likely to be near one another. Later can still be better if sellers compete in prices prior to search. Finally, with many sellers the optimal position may be first, last, or in between but earlier positions are favored as the number of sellers grows. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An International Real Business Cycle model with time-varying aggregate uncertainty, through a precautionary savings channel, can account for the positive correlation but implies counterfactual comovements for the other variables. Adding a credit supply channel with default and lenders exposed to aggregate risk allows the model to match all the facts. Higher volatility contracts credit supply and lowers investment and output.

The main theorem axiomatizes the anticipated stochastic choice (ASC) representation, wherein the decision maker maximizes the expected utility by the cognitive control of a probability measure over mental states that trigger the ex post choice of alternatives. A key prerequisite for this axiomatization is that the randomization between menus is identified with their perfectly correlated mixture, which includes only mixtures of specific alternative pairs. The essential uniqueness of an ASC representation defines an index of rationality that is relevant to a preference for commitment. Special cases of ASC include exact utility maximization, uncontrolled stochastic choice, trembling hands, and choice with limited attention. Furthermore, ASC accommodates potentially stochastic choice anomalies such as the attraction effect, cyclical choice, and position effects.","[Koida, Nobuo] Iwate Prefectural Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 152-52 Sugo, Takizawa, Iwate 0200693, Japan",Iwate Prefectural University,"Koida, N (通讯作者)，Iwate Prefectural Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 152-52 Sugo, Takizawa, Iwate 0200693, Japan.",nobuo@iwate-pu.ac.jp,"Koida, Nobuo/AAJ-6484-2020","Koida, Nobuo/0000-0003-4245-3895","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [24730168, 26380241]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730168] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to Itzhak Gilboa, Peter Hammond, Youichiro Higashi, Kazuya Hyogo, Atsushi Kajii, Paola Manzini, Marco Mariotti, Hitoshi Matsushima, Daisuke Nakajima, Yutaka Nakamura, Christopher Olivola, Daisuke Oyama, Hiroyuki Ozaki, Marciano Siniscalchi, Norio Takeoka, and the conference and seminar participants at SAET 2015, JEA 2011 Fall Meeting, Kyoto University, the University of Tokyo, Keio University, Okayama University, and Tohoku University for their helpful discussions and comments.

Visualizations were presented to survey respondents that varied both the number of turbines and their proximity to shore. Results indicate that there is not a scenario for which respondents would be willing to pay more to rent a home with turbines in view, as compared to the baseline view with no turbines in sight. Further, there is a substantial portion of the survey population that would change their vacation destination if wind farms were placed within visual range of the beach. The rental discounts required to attract the segment of the survey population most amenable to viewing wind farms still indicate that rental value losses of up to 10% are possible if a utility-scale wind farm is placed within 8 miles of shore.

Each car driver receives a quantity of traffic rights such that his adjusted marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost of congestion and payments are based on willingness to pay. We show that the level of congestion achieved is lower and each car user can receive more or fewer rights than under complete information. With symmetric beliefs, the payment rule results from a second-degree price discrimination. When beliefs are asymmetric, it results simultaneously from a second-degree price discrimination and from a third-degree price discrimination and high willingness-to-pay car users are discriminated against. The revenue raised can be used to reduce distortionary taxes, thereby gaining public acceptability.","[Mougeot, Michel] Univ Besancon, CRESE, Besancon, France; [Schwartz, Sonia] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Schwartz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",sonia.schwartz@udamail.fr,,,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government,This paper benefited from the financial support of the FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International) and of the program Investissement d'Avenir (reference ANR-10-LABX-14-01) of the French government.,,43,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

While studies of universities' knowledge transfer performance have so far focused on patent commercialisation and research contracting with industry, it is increasingly acknowledged that universities engage in a broader range of knowledge transfer activities, including consulting, public engagement and provision of knowledge-intensive services. When these are taken into account, less research-intensive universities, and those with a greater share of staff in the arts and humanities, improve their relative efficiency. More specialised, older and larger institutions are more efficient performers, while research intensity is no longer a strong predictor of efficiency.","[Rossi, Federica] Birkbeck Univ London, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Rossi, F (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",f.rossi@bbk.ac.uk,"Rossi, Federica/AFP-2812-2022","Rossi, Federica/0000-0002-5869-4469",,,,,85,13,14,4,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We find that (i) all RNMs have a poor out-of-sample performance of predicting USO returns and simple option returns, while the risk-neutral volatility (VOL) outperforms in terms of both in-sample and out-of-sample predicting delta-hedged option returns; (ii) most of the DRNMs can significantly predict the future USO returns, and (iii) differences in the risk-neutral third cumulant (DTC) and differences in the risk-neutral fourth cumulant (DFC) are two important predictors for the future USO option returns.

Taking advantage of a rich household survey dataset, this paper estimates the wage premium for each industry in the first stage conditional on individual worker and firm characteristics. Alternative measures of globalization are considered in the second stage: trade openness and capital openness. A disaggregation of trade into trade in final and intermediate goods shows that increases in import (export) shares of final goods reduce (increase) the wage premia significantly, whereas imports or exports of intermediate goods do not explain differences in industry wage premia. This finding is supported by stronger effects for final goods trade in coastal than noncoastal regions. Our results also show a positive relationship between capital openness and industrial wage premia, though this finding is less robust when potential endogeneity issues are allowed for.","[Wang, Feicheng] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Milner, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Scheffel, Juliane] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Gottingen; University of Nottingham; University of Leeds,"Wang, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Feicheng.Wang@uni-goettingen.de,,"Scheffel, Juliane/0000-0001-9932-5881",,,,,63,6,6,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We employ household-level data for Spain for years 2000-2015, a period characterized by high economic growth and large immigration that was halted by a long and severe recession. Our estimates reveal that increases in immigrant density at the school level triggered an important native flight from tuition-free, public schools toward private ones. We also find strong evidence of cream-skimming as more educated native households are the most likely to switch to private schools in response to immigration. Furthermore, we find that immigration leads to higher student teacher ratios in public schools. We conclude that our results are consistent with the predictions of a political-economy model of school choice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Subjective measures that uses survey questions about the customers' trade-off between risk and return is a better measure than the hypothetical lottery for explaining objective risk.

In this paper, we provide clean evidence that previous transactions play an important role in shaping perceptions of fairness. Buyers used to high market prices, for example, are more likely to perceive high prices as fair than buyers used to low market prices. Similarly, employees used to high wages are more likely to perceive low wages as unfair. Our data further allows us to decompose this history-dependence into the effects of pure observation versus the experience of payoff-relevant outcomes. We propose two classes of models of path-dependent fairness preferences-either based on endogenous fairness reference points or based on shifts in salience-that can account for our data. Structural estimates of both types of models imply a substantial deviation from existing history-independent models of fairness. Our results have implications for price discrimination, labor markets, and dynamic pricing.","[Herz, Holger] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Taubinsky, Dmitry] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of Fribourg; Dartmouth College,"Herz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland.",holger.herz@unifr.ch; dtaubinsky@gmail.com,,"Herz, Holger/0000-0003-3495-1640",Center for Foundations of Economic Preferences at the University of Zurich; Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation; Harvard Business School doctoral program; ERC grant on the Foundations of Economic Preferences,Center for Foundations of Economic Preferences at the University of Zurich; Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation; Harvard Business School doctoral program; ERC grant on the Foundations of Economic Preferences(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Philippe Aghion, Bjoern Bartling, Tom Cunningham, Stefano DellaVigna, Ernst Fehr, Oliver Hart, Michael Kosfeld, David Laibson, Michael Luca, Alex Peysakhovich, Al Roth, Klaus Schmidt, Florian Zimmermann, as well as seminar participants at Berkeley, Frankfurt, Fribourg, Harvard, Mainz, Vienna and Zurich, as well as participants at IMEBE 2013, THEEM 2013, the ESA World meeting 2013, the ESEM World meeting 2015, as well as at the V IIBEO workshop for helpful comments and discussions.

However, it is often difficult to tease Out the quantitative impact of such policies. In this paper, we examine the implications of one of the most significant tax changes initiated by voters in the United States on house prices, housing turnover, and household welfare. In 1978 California passed Proposition 13, which lowered property tax rates and restricted future property tax increases. We find that the introduction of Proposition 13 leads to a 15 percent increase in house prices and a 3.3 percent decrease in the moving rates. The elimination of Proposition 13, however, leads to modest changes in house prices and mobility but sizable welfare gains.","[Imrohoroglu, Ayse; Tuzel, Selale] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Matoba, Kyle] GSA Capital Partners, 5 Stratton St, London W1J 8LA, England",University of Southern California,"Imrohoroglu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ayse@marshall.usc.edu; kyle.matoba@gsacapital.com; tuzel@marshall.usc.edu,,,USC Lusk Center Research Award,USC Lusk Center Research Award,This research was partly supported by USC Lusk Center Research Award.,,41,5,5,4,27,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

After the reduction in mortgage payments, consumption of ARM holders increases relative to FRM but the implied marginal propensity to consume is not statistically different from zero. We suggest three explanations for the weak consumption response to the income shock. First, cash-on-hand and debt heterogeneity may attenuate the consumption response. Second, borrowers believe that the income shock was short-lasting, and that interest rates would likely increase in the future, implying a small effect on consumption. Third, the shock is offset partly by a reduction in income from financial assets owned by mortgagors. The findings have implications for the conduct of monetary policy interventions and the credibility of the future path of interest rates, pass-through of monetary policy, and design of the mortgage market.","[Jappelli, Tullio] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy; CSEF, Naples, Italy; CSEF, Washington, DC USA",University of Naples Federico II,"Jappelli, T (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.",,,"scognamiglio, annalisa/0000-0002-2392-1027",,,,,40,10,11,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The effects are likely to operate through exposure to university life rather than through degree-specific curricula or university-specific teaching quality.

J,"Osuna, V",,,,"Osuna, Victoria",,,What accounts for the increase in female labor force participation in Spain,ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Female labor force participation; gender wage gap; income tax; educational distribution; wage profiles; child care costs,,"Over the last three decades, Spanish female labor force participation (LFP) has tremendously increased, particularly, that of married women. At the same time, the income tax structure, the fiscal treatment of families, policies to reconcile family and work, and the education distribution of married couples have substantially changed. By contrast, the gender wage gap has remained quite stable. In this paper the author investigates the relevance of these factors in accounting for the growth in Spanish married women labor force participation from 1994 to 2008. For that purpose, she uses Kaygusuz' model of household labor market participation, and data from Eurostat to calibrate the model and evaluate its performance. The model successfully accounts for the rise in aggregate female labor force participation, and matches hours worked by males and females. The model is also able to replicate the pattern of female labor force participation by age and education. From this analysis we can conclude that changes in tax rates and in the education distribution are the main factors behind the increase in female LFP during the late nineties, while changes in child care costs and earning profiles are mainly responsible for the subsequent growth in the 2000s.","[Osuna, Victoria] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Osuna, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain.",vosupad@upo.es,"Osuna, Victoria/D-2512-2014",,[PAI-SEJ513]; [ECO2012-35430],;,The author gratefully acknowledges the support from research projects PAI-SEJ513 and ECO2012-35430.

Even if streaming displace sales, it may still raise overall revenue if the streaming payment is large enough in relation to the extent of sales displacement. We make use of the growth streaming during the years 2013-2015 to measure their collective impact on unpaid consumption and on the sales of recorded music. We are unable to statistically distinguish the distinct impacts of these services, but we reject that their combined impact on sales is zero. We also find that streaming displaces music piracy. Given the current industry's revenue from track sales ($0.82 per sale) and the average payment received p er stream b etween $1.51 and $2.77 per thousand streams or, on average, about $2.14 per thousand streams, our sales displacement estimates show that the losses from displaced sales are roughly outweighed by the gains in streaming revenue.

In this paper, we assert that travel demand modeling should be one of the many fields that focuses on the production of valid causal inferences, and we hypothesize about reasons for the current disconnect between the two bodies of research. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of uniting these two disciplines. We consider what travel demand modeling can gain from greater incorporation of techniques and perspectives from the causal inference literatures, and we briefly discuss what the causal inference literature might gain from the work of travel demand modelers. In this paper, we do not attempt to solve issues related to the drawing of causal inferences from travel demand models. Instead, we hope to spark a larger discussion both within and between the travel demand modeling and causal inference literatures. In particular, we hope to incite discussion about the necessity of drawing causal inferences in travel demand applications and the methods by which one might credibly do so.","[Brathwaite, Timothy] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walker, Joan L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 111 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Brathwaite, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 116 McLaughlin Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",timothyb0912@berkeley.edu; joanwalker@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,90,7,10,4,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

On the other hand, endogenous job creation leads unemployed job finding probabilities to be too low at equilibrium, and also decreasing at the end of the working life. In turn, the latter implies that training externalities are lower for the older workers.

In fact, when both the value of gold and the expression of wages in terms of the standard of prices are taken into account, it is shown that relative surplus value may arise without any changes in money wages.","[Cipolla, Francisco Paulo] Univ Fed Parana, Marxian Econ, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana,"Cipolla, FP (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, Dept Econ, Av Prefeito Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",cipolla@ufpr.br,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Here I review the intellectual history of this field, with critical remarks and proposals for future development. The decades of the 1960s-1980s saw a burst of theoretical speculation that generally did not hold up well under empirical scrutiny. By the 1990s, progress on the mainstream theory of the firm was overtaking some of this early research. At the same time, a growing body of econometric work on labor-managed firms was providing new stylized facts for theorists to explain. While the earlier period was characterized by an excess supply of theories relative to facts, more recently the balance has begun to tip in the opposite direction. I close by suggesting new theoretical directions that might shed light on the empirical asymmetries between capital-managed and labor-managed firms.","[Dow, Gregory K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Dow, GK (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",gdow@sfu.ca,,"Dow, Gregory/0000-0002-5441-1353",,,,,87,20,21,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Suitability of land for plow adoption is shown to influence both traditional postmarital residence rules and contemporary under-5 sex ratios. A quasi-natural experiment identifies causal impacts of the sex of a woman's first-born child on fertility and under-5 mortality across household types with historically different relative productivity of the sexes in agriculture. Impacts vary across household type for rural but not for second-generation urban women. Cultural heterogeneity attributable to relative productivity in preindustrial societies is strongly mitigated by rural-urban migration.,"[Grogan, Louise] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Grogan, Louise] Univ Cent Asia, Khorugh, Tajikistan",University of Guelph; University of Central Asia,"Grogan, L (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.;Grogan, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Asia, Khorugh, Tajikistan.",,,,"College of Business Economics at the University of Guelph, Canada","College of Business Economics at the University of Guelph, Canada","Many thanks to the editors and referees of this journal and to Becky Livernois, Shannon Potter, Alison Taylor, and Jennifer Teng for very heterogenous and useful research assistance.

The present paper presents evidence that along with declining average living standards, consumption inequality has seriously grown, fueled primarily by a disproportionate drop in the consumption levels of what can be considered the middle class. Although poverty has not significantly risen in relative terms, it climbs to around 45 percent once the poverty threshold is anchored to pre-crisis levels. Furthermore, significant indirect tax hikes have further increased inequality in consumption expenditure. The paper also shows that several reforms launched in the name of reducing labor costs, broadening the tax base or rationalizing the targeting of social benefits have had detrimental effects on one of the most vulnerable population groups, namely families with children, thus implying that the social consequences of the crisis will be long-lasting.","Univ Athens, Athens, Greece; Acad Athens, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Academy of Athens,"Kaplanoglou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Sofokleous 1, Athens 10559, Greece.",gkaplanog@econ.uoa.gr,"Rapanos, Vassilis/HKM-8686-2023; Kaplanoglou, Georgia/AAL-7674-2021",,,,,,50,26,28,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Overall, financial market shocks seem to be irrelevant to returns to education. However, when we divide a financial market shock into cash flow news and discount rate news leading to a negative risk premium, returns to education increase after positive news about future cash flows and unexpected increases in discount rates Therefore, the risk exposure to cash flow shocks is offset by the exposure to discount rate shocks. The returns to education of low-income workers were significantly exposed to the cash flow risk as compared to those with a high income, but they were offset by the positive correlation to discount rate shocks. In contrast, considering the gap between generations, the old generation was not only less exposed to the cash flow risk compared to the young generation regarding returns to education but also positively correlated with the discount rate shock, resulting in less exposure to financial market risks.","[Lee, Jaeram] Gachon Univ, Coll Business, Seongnam Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Ihm, Jungjoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Dent, Seoul, South Korea",Gachon University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Ihm, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Dent, Seoul, South Korea.",ijj127@snu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Jaeram/0000-0001-6050-5455",,,,,20,1,1,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

In addition to structural forces, cyclical factors are also shown to account for these patterns, with the participation rate being procyclical in the US since the inception of the crisis and countercyclical in the euro area. We rationalize these diverging developments by using a general equilibrium business cycle model, which nests the endogenous participation decisions into a search and matching framework. We show that the added worker effect might outweigh the discouragement effect if real wage rigidities are allowed for and/or habit in consumers' preferences is sufficiently strong. We then draw the implications of variable labor force participation for inflation and establish the following result: if endogenous movements in labor market participation are envisaged, then the degree of real wage rigidities becomes almost irrelevant for price dynamics. Indeed, during recessions, the upward pressures on inflation stemming from the lack of downward adjustment of real wages are offset by an opposite influence from the additional looseness in the labor market, due to the higher participation associated with wage rigidities.","[Nucci, Francesco] Sapienza Univ, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy; [Riggi, Marianna] Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Riggi, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy.",marianna.riggi@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,35,8,8,3,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

For this purpose, a dynamic duality model framework of inter-temporal decision making is used. Using a panel data set of 4,201 Chinese farms from three provinces (i.e. Zhejiang, Hubei and Yunnan) from 2003 to 2006, this is the first study to investigate the allocative and technical efficiencies of Chinese agriculture using a dynamic shadow cost approach. The findings show that the adjustment of quasi-fixed inputs is rather sluggish, implying that adjustment costs are considerably high on Chinese farms. The relatively low levels of allocative and technical efficiencies indicate that most farms are unable to catch up with the production frontier under the existing production technology. They are also unable to use various inputs in the appropriate proportion given their respective prices. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This article investigates the sustainability characteristics of their economies and the contention that they were affluent. Contemporary tests of economic sustainability are applied. Hence attention is paid to the ability of their economic systems to promote the longevity of existence of Homo sapiens and their effectiveness in achieving intergenerational equity. Also, satisfaction of the three-pillar requirement for sustainability (namely that social, environmental and economic sustainability ought to be simultaneously satisfied) is taken into account. The view that traditional Aborigines were affluent is examined, and reasons are given why they were reluctant to acquire and accumulate material goods. Their failure to develop agriculture was consequential for their cultural and economic sustainability. This aspect is explored. Traditional Aboriginal socio-economic systems are found to be highly sustainable and may have resulted in affluence. Does this mean they were or are desirable?

We find that Moore-Repullo mechanisms fail to implement truth-telling in a substantial number of cases even under perfect information about the valuation of the good. Our data further suggests that a substantial proportion of these lies are made by subjects who hold pessimistic beliefs about the rationality of their trading partners. Although the mechanism should-in theory-provide incentives for truth-telling, many buyers in fact believe that they can increase their expected monetary payoff by lying. The deviations from truth-telling become significantly more frequent and more persistent when agents face small amounts of uncertainty regarding the good's value. Our results thus suggest that both beliefs about irrational play and small amounts of uncertainty about valuations may constitute important reasons for the absence of Moore-Repullo mechanisms in practice.

An intuition for herding is that this coarseness of the action space relative to the space of potential beliefs is responsible for herding, and were the action space sufficiently rich, learning would be complete. That intuition is false: simple examples illustrate that learning may be incomplete even if the action space is isomorphic to the space of beliefs. What then distinguishes models with coarse versus rich action spaces? This paper develops the language of responsiveness to formalize this distinction. Responsiveness assesses the sensitivity of optimal actions with respect to their rationalizing beliefs. If the optimal action always changes with beliefs, then complete learning is guaranteed regardless of the information structure. By contrast, if the action that is optimal at certainty remains optimal near-certainty, then complete learning is guaranteed if and only if information can induce unbounded likelihood ratios. The lens of responsiveness unifies results across coarse and rich action spaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ali, S.

The outcome is that municipalities strategically interact when investing in infrastructures, with the small municipality reacting more to the expenditure of its neighbor than the big one. This theoretical prediction is tested by estimating the determinants of the stock of public infrastructures of the municipalities belonging to the Autonomous Province of Trento in Italy. By introducing the classical spatial lag-error component, we find that municipalities positively react to an increase in infrastructures by their neighbors, but the effect vanishes above a given population threshold. Such a result is confirmed when we exploit the exogenous variation in the neighbors' stock of infrastructures induced by a strong flood that occurred in the Province of Trento in 2000.","[Ferraresi, Massimiliano; Rizzo, Leonzio] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Galmarini, Umberto] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Diritto Econ & Culture, Via S Abbondio 9, I-22100 Como, Italy; [Galmarini, Umberto; Rizzo, Leonzio] IEB, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Ferrara; University of Insubria,"Rizzo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.;Rizzo, L (通讯作者)，IEB, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",massimiliano.ferraresi@unife.it; umberto.galmarini@uninsubria.it; leonzio.rizzo@unife.it,,"Galmarini, Umberto/0000-0001-8540-5581; ferraresi, massimiliano/0000-0001-7378-4641",University of Ferrara; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37873]; Bando FIR,University of Ferrara; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Bando FIR,"We wish to thank the Autonomous Province of Trento for kindly providing the data, and Piero Giarda, Ian Preston two anonymous referees and seminar participants in Siegen, Barcelona and Lecce, at the 2014 Gerard-Varet Conference, Aix-en-Provence, the 2014 APET Conference, Seattle, the 2014 IIPF Conference, Lugano, for useful comments.

Industry-specific demand and cost linkages induce a distinction between the returns to innovation. In differentiated industries, cannibalization is lower and firms invest more in product innovation. In homogeneous industries, firms internalize intra-firm spillovers and invest more in process innovation. Using firm-level data and large exchange rate devaluations, we show that better access to foreign markets increases the incentive to innovate. However, we exploit differential effects across industries and show that the innovation strategies depend on the scope of differentiation.","[Flach, Lisandra; Irlacher, Michael] Univ Munich, Ludwigstr 28, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Flach, Lisandra] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Flach, Lisandra] CEPR, London, England",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Flach, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ludwigstr 28, D-80539 Munich, Germany.;Flach, L (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Flach, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",lisandra.flach@econ.lmu.de; michael.irlacher@econ.lmu.de,,"Irlacher, Michael/0000-0002-0917-1928","German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB TR 15, EC 216/7-1]; Brazilian Statistical Office (IBGE)",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Brazilian Statistical Office (IBGE),"We are grateful to Daniel Baumgarten, Carsten Eckel, Kalina Manova, Thierry Mayer, Emanuel Ornelas, Jennifer Poole, Valerie Smeets, Jens Suedekum, and participants at the Workshop International Economics in Goettingen, European Economic Association in Toulouse, EITI-FREIT in Vietnam, European Trade Study Group in Munich, FIW Research Conference in Vienna, Midwest International Economics Group in Columbus, and IO-Trade Seminar Munich for their helpful comments.

We analyze the implications of different OECD methods to regulate transfer pricing and the role of a source tax on royalty payments for abusive transfer pricing. First, we show that under the traditional transfer pricing methods mispricing of royalty payments does not affect investment behavior. In contrast, the Transactional Profit Split Method that is promoted by the OECD for evaluating firms in the digital economy triggers higher investment in order to facilitate higher profit shifting. Second, royalty taxation is effective in reducing (such) abusive profit shifting, but always reduces investment.

The younger cohorts, relative to the 1950s, supply more labor at earlier stages of the life-cycle, delay motherhood to later stages without reducing the fertility rate, and upon childbearing, show a greater tendency to stay out of the labor force. In a life-cycle model for married couples in which a household makes decisions on fertility as well as labor supply, consumption, and savings, all the behavioral changes are jointly and quantitatively explained by a combination of changes in various labor supply/fertility determinants, with the increased returns (penalties) to work (non-work) experience being the dominant contributor. The results survive a series of robustness tests, including endogenizing education choice and assortative marriage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

On one hand, from the ontological and heuristic perspectives, we argue that our proposal opens the possibility for constructing a general, interpretative framework in evolutionary economics. On the other hand, from a theoretical-explanatory perspective, we detect certain coevolution paths that may engender global pathologies in capitalist societies.

This article presents new estimates of scale economies of pension funds and is the first that also measures pension fund X-inefficiency. We use a unique supervisory data set which distinguishes between administrative and investment costs and apply various approaches and models. Our estimates show large economies of scale for pension fund administrations, but modest diseconomies of scale for investment activities. We also found that many pension funds have substantial X-inefficiencies for both administrative and investment activities. The two kinds of inefficiency differ across types of pension funds. Therefore, most pension funds should be able to improve their cost performance, and hence increase pension benefits.","[Alserda, Gosse A.

For information type, hard news from business-oriented programmes and earnings-related news strongly contributes to the attention effect, while the effect of soft news is weaker. Bid-ask spread widens for more TV information flows, suggesting that new information arrival in the market expands information asymmetry.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining governments effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","[Arora, Puneet; Chong, Alberto] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Chong, Alberto] Univ Pacifico, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Chong, Alberto] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Chong, A (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Chong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.;Chong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru.",achong6@gsu.edu,"Arora, Puneet/GZN-1044-2022","Arora, Puneet/0000-0001-5899-1386",,,,,33,15,16,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Yet, serious weaknesses in these statistics persist. The extent of bias in smallholder labor data is examined by conducting a randomized survey experiment among farming households in rural Tanzania. Agricultural labor estimates obtained through weekly surveys are compared with the results of reporting in a single end-of-season recall survey. The findings show strong evidence of recall bias: people in traditional recall-style modules reported working up to four times as many hours per person-plot as those reporting labor on a weekly basis. Recall bias manifests both in the intensive and extensive margins of labor reporting: while hours are over-reported in recall, the number of people and plots active in agricultural work are under-reported. The evidence suggests that this recall bias is driven not only by failures in memory, but also by the mental burdens of reporting on highly variable agricultural work patterns to provide a typical estimate. All things equal, studies suffering from this bias would understate agricultural labor productivity.","[Arthi, Vellore] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Beegle, Kathleen; Palacios-Lopez, Amparo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",University of Essex; The World Bank; University of Antwerp; KU Leuven,"Beegle, K (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",kbeegle@worldbank.org,,"De Weerdt, Joachim/0000-0002-5572-3332",IZA/DFID Growth and Labour Markets in Low Income Countries Program (GLM-LIC) [GA-C3-RA1-360]; World Bank Research Committee,IZA/DFID Growth and Labour Markets in Low Income Countries Program (GLM-LIC); World Bank Research Committee,"This study is an output of the Minding the (Data) Gap: Improving Measurements of Agricultural Productivity through Methodological Validation and Research project led by the Living Standards Measurement Study team of the World Bank and funded by the U.K. Department for International Development.

This paper demonstrates that the contract that maximizes the minimum payoff over all possible probability distributions of quality is a screening menu that separates all types, whereas the optimal contract for any given probability distribution is a posted price, which induces bunching. Using the epsilon-contamination model, according to which the buyer's utility is a weighted average of his single prior expected utility and the worst-case scenario, the analysis further shows that for intermediate degrees of confidence, the optimal mechanism combines features of both of these contracts.","[Auster, Sarah] Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy; [Auster, Sarah] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Auster, Sarah] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; European University Institute,"Auster, S (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Italy.;Auster, S (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy.",sarah.auster@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,23,9,12,0,3,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Our modeling framework is the large-firm search and matching model. Our comparative statics are in line with previous empirical findings: a moderate increase in the minimum wage barely affects employment, while it compresses the wage distribution and generates positive spillovers on higher wages. The model also predicts an increase in the stock of capital. Next, we perform the policy experiment of introducing a 10 dollar minimum wage. Our results suggest large positive effects on capital (4.0%) and output (1.8%), with a decrease in employment by 2.8%.

First, although copyright is understood as a means of encouraging the creation of new works, the optimal number of such works is generally not considered. Second, copyright infringement encompasses two different activities subsumed under the same legal umbrella: One might either pirate (i.e., illegally copy) a work or one might create a new work which is a close imitation of an existing one. The mutual recognition of these two features leads to some surprising conclusions relevant to current debate over copyright reform. In particular, while strong piracy protection encourages overproduction of intellectual property, enhanced protection against imitation can mitigate the associated inefficiencies, benefitting society.","[Beard, T.

The evidence indicates that in general countries that share trade agreements are more likely to develope cross-border supply chains. In this analysis, we argue that in order to examine the effects of trade agreements on the formation of supply chains between two countries, it is not enough to analyse the impact of the trade agreements that the two countries share but it is also important to assess the impact of the trade agreements that they share with third countries. Using data on trade in value added for 129 countries, we show empirically that about 40% of the potential increase in trade in value added induced by a trade agreement between an importing country and a sourcing partner is wiped out by each additional trade agreement signed by the importing country with third nations in which the sourcing partner is not a member. The result has important implications for regions seeking to develop international supply chains but in which the process of integration is highly fragmented.","[Blyde, Juan; Faggioni, Valeria] Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20755 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Blyde, J (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20755 USA.",juanbl@iadb.org,,,,,,,7,6,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In this new version, termed EAGLE-FLI (Euro Area and GLobal Economy with Financial Linkages), banks collect deposits from domestic households and cross-country inter-bank market and raise capital to finance loans issued to domestic households and firms. In order to borrow from local (regional) banks, households use domestic real estate whereas firms use both domestic real estate and physical capital as collateral. These features together with the full characterization of trade balance and real exchange rate dynamics and with a rich array of financial shocks allow to properly assessing domestic and cross-country macroeconomic effects of financial shocks. Our results support the views that (1) the business cycles in the EA can be driven not only by real shocks, but also by financial shocks, (2) the financial sector could amplify the transmission of (real) shocks, and (3) the financial/banking shocks and the banking sectors can be sources of business cycle asymmetries and spillovers across countries in a monetary union.","[Bokan, N.; Jacquinot, P.] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gerali, A.; Pisani, M.] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy; [Gomes, S.] Bank Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal",European Central Bank; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Banco de Portugal,"Jacquinot, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,"Gomes, Sandra/0009-0003-9239-7243",,,,,28,4,4,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A fiscal distress episode is identified as a period when government experiences extreme funding difficulties. Most EWSs employ a specific set of only fiscal leading indicators predetermined by the researchers, which casts doubt on their robustness. We revisit this issue using extreme bounds analysis, which allows identifying robust leading indicators of fiscal distress from a large set. A robust leading indicator's effect does not strongly depend on the model specification. Consistent with the theoretical predictions of latest generation crisis models, we find that both fiscal and non-fiscal leading indicators are robust. In addition, we find that a fiscal vulnerability indicator based on fiscal and non-fiscal leading indicators offers a 29% gain in predictive power compared to a traditional one based only on fiscal leading indicators. This suggests that both fiscal and non-fiscal leading indicators should be taken into account when assessing country's vulnerability to fiscal distress.","[Bruns, Martin] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Poghosyan, Tigran] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; International Monetary Fund,"Bruns, M (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany.",mbruns@diw.de,,,,,,,41,7,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The main goal is to investigate the effects of the credit constraint on the optimal human capital decision, in terms of degree of schooling, taking into account the household preferences for education. Our starting point is a theoretical model of human capital investment decision with credit constraint. Following a previous model in the literature, we propose a reduced-form approach that estimates the relation between education decision and initial wealth in Brazil. Our empirical analysis is conducted using data from a Brazilian Household Budget Survey (Pesquisa de Orcamentos Familiares), for years 2002-2003 and 2008-2009. Our results point out that education decision is in fact credit constrained. The empirical results show a strong and highly significant effect of wealth on educational level of children, teenagers and adults, even controlling by education expenditures. But we find no evidence of credit constraint on high level education decision, like undergraduate and graduate levels.","[Chein, Flavia] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Econ, Juiz De Fora, Brazil; [Chein, Flavia; Pinto, Cristine] CNPq Natl Res Council, Brasiilia, Brazil; [Pinto, Cristine] Sao Paulo Sch Econ EESP FGV, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Chein, F (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Econ, Juiz De Fora, Brazil.;Chein, F (通讯作者)，CNPq Natl Res Council, Brasiilia, Brazil.",flavia.chein@ufjf.edu.br,"Chein, Flavia/AAD-1981-2021","Chein, Flavia/0000-0003-4002-2522",Swiss Program for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d program); CNPq; FAPEMIG,Swiss Program for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d program); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),This project received funds from Swiss Program for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d program) under the thematic research module ' Employment in the context of sustainable development' and the research project ' Trade and Labor Market Outcomes in Developing Countries'.

This inherent feature of the data-generating process suggests structural non-identification when both stocks and flows appear in the design matrix and a constraint is required to identify parameters. Much financial research has fallen into this 'accounting identity trap' and routinely employs implicit constraints to enable estimation, albeit without acknowledgement of the constraints hence the misleading inferences. This article elucidates the problem of parameter identification under stock-and-flow rank deficiency using existing applications on equity pricing.

No earlier studies particularly investigated the importance of social interactions during such crowdfunding campaigns. Hence, we particularly take the interaction between the project owner and the community as well as among community members into account. We empirically investigated potential success factors for crowdfunding projects of entrepreneurs on the base of 430 projects from the German crowdfunding platform Visionbakery. Our results show that social interaction during a crowdfunding campaign indeed increases the likelihood of its success. As comments from crowd members on particular projects might be positive or negative and can also provide additional argumentation or raise questions, comments can cause a dialog among crowd members. This shows that herding might not only be related to the number of contributors but also to their shared attributes and perceptions. Our discussion of theoretical and managerial implications closes with recommendations for future research on this evolving topic.","[Claus, Thomas] Philipps Univ Marburg, Sch Business & Econ, Marburg, Germany; [Breitenecker, Robert J.] Univ Linz, Inst Innovat Management, Linz, Austria; [Kraus, Sascha] ESCE Int Business Sch, Ecole Super Commerce Exterieur, Paris, France; [Brem, Alexander] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Chair Technol Management, Erlangen, Germany; [Brem, Alexander] Univ Southern Denmark SDU, Mads Clausen Inst, Odense, Denmark; [Richter, Chris] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland",Philipps University Marburg; Johannes Kepler University Linz; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Southern Denmark; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Kraus, S (通讯作者)，ESCE Int Business Sch, Ecole Super Commerce Exterieur, Paris, France.",sascha.kraus@gmail.com,"Brem, Alexander/F-8452-2011; Breitenecker, Robert/R-8753-2019; Breitenecker, Robert/AAC-8012-2022; Breitenecker, Robert J/A-5633-2011; Clauß, Thomas/O-7380-2019","Brem, Alexander/0000-0002-6901-7498; Breitenecker, Robert/0000-0003-4485-5388; Breitenecker, Robert/0000-0003-4485-5388; Clauß, Thomas/0000-0001-7799-6369",,,,,81,60,60,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.
