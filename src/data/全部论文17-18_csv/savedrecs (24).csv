J,"Dyer, J",,,,"Dyer, Jay",,,The Many Layers of Meaning of 007,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Until Umberto Eco developed a semiotic analysis of Ian Fleming's series of novels with James Bond as the protagonist, few literary critics took them seriously. That was a mistake. There are many layers of meaning in Fleming's simple prose, and some of those layers may still elude analysts. The Bond series of books and novels have been mined for ideas about cultural change, sexuality, politics, consumerism, the body as symbol, and other features of the Bond persona. Yet, all of these methods of analysis fail to dig beneath the surface. To fully comprehend the character of James Bond, this article suggests that one must take into account the imperialism of the author, Ian Fleming, who strongly believed in the national destiny of England. Another crucial feature that underlies the motivations of James Bond is the ideology of eugenics, which Fleming wholeheartedly embraced. Finally, some features of the Bond series only make sense if one considers the mystical and alchemical beliefs of Fleming. The heroic archetype of James Bond is not merely a symbol of patriotism. Bond, in a sense, is an alchemist who is able to draw upon elements of fantasy to bring about a purpose that is even higher than nationalism.",,,,,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Because the defendant's assets are not observable, this serves as a source of asymmetric information which leads to trials in the equilibrium of the model. Unlike many other types of informational asymmetry, the defendant's assets are not generally subject to discovery and it may be difficult to credibly establish a lack of assets in a voluntary disclosure. Thus, this is a source of asymmetry between the parties which is likely to persist in the presence of these institutions. This suggests that this particular asymmetry is a potentially important explanation for settlement failure, at least in a subset of cases. We describe three possible equilibria in the model with asset constrained defendants. The constrained equilibrium is consistent with high dispute rates between the plaintiff and defendant. The model suggests that fee shifting will either have no effect on the incidence of trial or will increase it. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our strategy for estimating the effect of the electoral connection is to leverage the enactment of 17th Amendment-which influenced the electoral mechanism for senators but not for members of the House of Representatives. This plausibly exogenous institutional variation allows us to isolate the effect of the electoral connection from other possible historical influences- such as the growth of the administrative state or the rise of political progressivism. We find that the 17th Amendment dramatically increased the Senate's propensity to investigate during divided party control. Importantly, we also find little evidence of such an increase in the House. Our findings support the contemporary claim that congressional investigations are political tool motivated by the desire to discredit the opposition and reap individual electoral gains.","[Lowande, Kenneth] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Peck, Justin] San Francisco State Univ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Lowande, K (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,,54,8,9,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The analysis relies on a difference-in-differences approach which exploits the discontinuity in program rules to compare eligible individuals to ineligible, likely undocumented immigrants before and after the program went into effect. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we focus on youths that likely met DACA's schooling requirement when the program was announced. We find that DACA reduced the probability of school enrollment of eligible higher-educated individuals, as well as some evidence that it increased the employment likelihood of men, in particular. Together, these findings suggest that a lack of authorization may lead individuals to enroll in school when working is not a viable option. Thus, once employment restrictions are relaxed and the opportunity costs of higher education rise, eligible individuals may reduce investments in schooling.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Antman, Francisca] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Antman, F (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu; Francisca.Antman@colorado.edu,"Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X; ANTMAN, FRANCISCA/0000-0002-4283-149X",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,22,53,77,2,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Rather than using the standard but fragmented system of counties, this small post-transition economy is first mapped into five regions following the concept of regional innovation systems (RISs). Essentially, RIS concept rests on an idea that interactions among regional agents lead to the creation of optimal innovation output, while policy based on Smart specialisation strategy in Croatia is a national policy that promotes creation of innovative products and services in five promising domains and 13 sub-thematic areas. Analysis is carried out in two steps, firstly using a data-driven approach employed in a multidimensional framework for assessing regional accessibility, absorptive capacity and diffusion of knowledge in the context of Smart specialisation strategy (S3) implementation. In the second step, the assumption of post-transition reliance on the external knowledge and technology in producing innovation output is examined via regional presence of high-technology firms, GDP per capita and international trade and investment variables and patents per 100.000 inhabitants using cluster analysis (Ward method). The results show that highly internationalised regions with higher density of hightechnology firms already produce relatively more innovation output per capita. With already favourable conditions in place, these progressive regions are most likely to reinforce their competitive advantages through the transformation of their economic structures enabled by implementation of S3.","[Aralica, Zoran] Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedyja 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Aralica, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedyja 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",bacic.keti@gmail.com; zaralica@eizg.hr,"Aralica, Zoran/AAM-9838-2020",,"project Strengthening scientific and research capacity of the Institute of Economics, Zagreb as a cornerstone for Croatian socioeconomic growth through the implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategy [H2020-TWINN-2015-692191-SmartEIZ]","project Strengthening scientific and research capacity of the Institute of Economics, Zagreb as a cornerstone for Croatian socioeconomic growth through the implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategy","Draft version of the paper was presented during Training Workshop 'Assessing innovation policy: overview of theoretical, design and implementation issues' held from 19 to 21 April in Zagreb 2017, within the project Strengthening scientific and research capacity of the Institute of Economics, Zagreb as a cornerstone for Croatian socioeconomic growth through the implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategy (H2020-TWINN-2015-692191-SmartEIZ).",,29,2,2,0,21,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The principle of substantive truth finding must be balanced with other important values, especially, the interest for fundamental human rights protection. The principle of guilt is basic principle of criminal law which legitimate the punishment in twofold sense: individual guilt is a basis and measure of punishment. It is important that the measure of sentence does not exceed the established degree of the guilt of the o-ender. On the other hand, principle of substantive truth finding legitimate the criminal procedure and a verdict. Establishing the true facts of the case, which is indispensable for realizing the principle of individual guilt, is the central objective of criminal proceedings. The establishment of the degree of individual guilt contributes to realization of justice through sentencing, and justly sentences can influence the strenghtening of public trust in operation of criminal justice system. Both principles are jeopardized by interests of process economy,. Therefore, it is important to ensure that modern criminal procedure of mixed type with strong adversial elements is shaped in such a way that interests of process economy does not dominate over the principle of substantive truth finding. Within this context, it is worth to support elto' rts which insist upon courts control of plea bargaining (existance of evidence other than confession of the accused) and clearer and more complete regulation of the principle of substantive truth finding in Criminal procedure code,",,,,bojanic165@gmail.com; vesna.skareozbolt@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2017,13.0,,,,,,907,925,,,,,,19,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463854000059,0

One impediment in defining marketing ethics is the difficulty of pointing out the agency responsible for the practice of ethics. Competition, rivalry among the firms, lack of autonomy of the persons at different levels of marketing hierarchy, nature of the products marketed, nature of the persons to whom products are marketed, the profit margin claimed, and everything relating the marketing field does make the agency of a marketing person just a cog in the wheel.

The two processes of innovation and internationalisation have become ever more interconnected as central drivers of development since the first industrial revolution, through to today's information age. The increasing significance of the knowledge-seeking motive for IB networks and of competence-creating subsidiary activities at a local level have linked localised innovation systems to IB and to international knowledge exchange.

This article focuses on one of such aspects, namely, the financial aspect. The analysis of literature and available statistical data shows that Polish SMEs are not very innovative, mainly due to financial barriers. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to identify the barriers to innovation of Polish SMEs. The paper also seeks to examine the relationship between the use of trade credit and enterprise innovation. In order to achieve the aim, the analysis was conducted on the basis of articles published in Journal of Banking & Finance, European Journal of Operational Research, and Small Business Economics. The analysis also covers the results of empirical studies published in the reports of the Polish Ministry of Economy, Polish Confederation of Private Employers PKPP Lewiatan and the study conducted by the authors on the use of trade credit in Polish SMEs, the results of which are later compared with the results of similar studies conducted in the United States, Spain and Japan. The results presented in this paper show that there is a significant difference between the degree of use of trade credit among Poland and other analysed countries. In the United States, Spain and Japan, trade credit is very popular and represents an alternative form of financing for companies in the SME sector. However, Polish enterprises use a completely different strategy for financing their activities, which is only slightly based on trade credit, thus resulting in a negative impact on innovation of those enterprises.","[Duda, Joanna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Gramatyka Str 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland; [Gasior, Aleksandra] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Microecon, A Mickiewicza Str 64-411, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Alebaite, Irena] Lithuanian Energy Inst, Complex Energy Res Lab, Breslaujos Str 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania",AGH University of Krakow; University of Szczecin; Lithuanian Energy Institute,"Duda, J (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Gramatyka Str 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland.",aduda@zarz.agh.edu.pl; aleksandra.gasior@usz.edu.pl; irena.alebaite@lei.lt,"Gąsior, Aleksandra/HTQ-3948-2023","Gąsior, Aleksandra/0000-0003-3959-6094",,,,,77,3,3,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This new methodology complements traditional methodologies of shadow economy estimation with such a component as digital shadow economy. Our analysis of the most popular today methods of shadow economic estimation proves that, despite some of its drawbacks, the MIMIC model can be treated as the most comprehensive and appropriate method for such calculations since it takes into account both causal and indicators of shadow economy. As the causal variables here, as applied to digital shadow economy, we use household access to the Internet and IT overall, the volume of non-cash payments and the use of most advanced financial instruments. While as the indicators of the digital shadow economy spread we use: the volume of non-cash payments at online platforms, the frequency of cryptocurrency payments, and the cost of parcels to which customs duties have not been applied. For further empirical verification of the model proposed here, numerical values of both causal variables and indicators would be necessary. Unfortunately, official statistical sources are unable to provide such data in full volume, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies and other informal payments.

The current regulatory frameworks have not lived up to expectations as the recent experiences in Europe (France) and North America (Quebec) demonstrate. Although the patterns of regulation and the approaches used in both continents are, in some respects, similar, still some important differences do exist. To better understand the reasons for such a performance, the paper examines best practices in nanotechnology and financial industries. Five lessons emerge from this analysis, and they are applied in the context of shale gas industry. Disruptive technologies create a knowledge gap between the industry and regulatory agencies, and this makes the latter less effective. This is reflected in their inability to develop a regulatory framework that is flexible and capable of taking into account the rapid pace of technological changes that occur in this industry. Also, both countries were unsuccessful in making their regulation credible essentially because they have not taken into serious consideration the environmental, health, and equity issues. Nonetheless, France performs better than Quebec in the harmonization of its regulation with the rest of its trading partners, but France still needs to make further advances in this area. Unless regulators develop new regulatory frameworks that take into account the five lessons learned from the analysis of other dynamic industries with disruptive technologies, they will not be able to appease the opposing interest groups, and this may negatively affect the shale gas industry and a country's growth and development.","[Gentzoglanis, Anastassios] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Study Regulatory Econ & Finance, 2500 Univ Bould, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",University of Sherbrooke,"Gentzoglanis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Study Regulatory Econ & Finance, 2500 Univ Bould, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",anastassios.gentzoglanis@USherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,411,432,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_29,0.0,,,22,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400029,0

The theoretical framework is built around brand relationships with a particular focus on evolvement of brand relationships. This case study is conducted as a multi-method qualitative research, where seven in-depth interviews are combined with 167 units of netnographic data. These two methods enable triangulation of data, clarify the interpretation process and provide a multidimensional understanding of the topic. The data analysis follows a narrative interpretation framework. The brand of interest is the Karl Fazer milk chocolate called as Fazer Blue, the renowned Finnish milk chocolate brand. The empirical data uncovers story-like narratives of consumption and brand experiences. Brand relationships are found to play a prominent part in identity transition. In the case of Fazer Blue, the long-term brand relationship is protected by love felt toward the brand. Fazer Blue evokes strong meanings and memories. Clear evidence of the evolving nature of brand relationships emerges from the empirical data. Due to the distance, the importance of the brand increases. In light of empirical findings, it is suggested that in practice, expatriates and their insight should be better heard, understood and utilized in terms of brand development.","[Lemmetti, Hanna; Tuominen, Pekka] Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Tuominen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Management, Tampere, Finland.",hanna.lemmettii@gmail.com; pekka.tuominen@uta.fi,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7.0,,,,,,401,422,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_26,0.0,,,22,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700026,0

In particular, this situation offers an opportunity to examine the strategic efforts of print newspapers to prevent competitive displacement, as well as the effectiveness of these strategies. This article addresses these issues through an analysis of a unique data set, constructed from 20 years of newspaper circulation data, as well as data on local market characteristics, newspaper staffing and content variety, and state-level Internet penetration. Specifically, this article examines whether, and to what extent, these competitive strategies impacted local print newspaper circulation trends over this 20-year time period. This analysis focuses on the following strategic responses: (a) newspapers' launching of online versions (a diversification strategy within the language of media evolution literature); and (b) newspapers' efforts to cover a greater variety of subject areas, as measured by the number of editors and special editorial sections produced. (The authors characterize these as a mimicking strategy from media evolution literature, as this strategy essentially represents an effort to simulate the much greater content variety that readers can find online). This article examines the relationships between these circulation, strategic, and Internet penetration variables over a 20-year time period, while also taking into account relevant characteristics of local newspaper markets.","[Mierzejewska, Bozena I.; Yim, Dobin] Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 45 Columbus Ave,Martino Hall, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Napoli, Philip M.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC USA; [Lucas, Henry C., Jr.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Al-Hasan, Abrar] Kuwait Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kuwait, Kuwait",Fordham University; Duke University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Kuwait University,"Mierzejewska, BI (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 45 Columbus Ave,Martino Hall, New York, NY 10023 USA.",bmierzejewska@fordham.edu,"Al-Hasan, Abrar/AEX-0323-2022","Al-Hasan, Abrar/0000-0002-1662-6417; Yim, Dobin/0000-0002-9360-8343",,,,,37,16,18,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

In some circumstances, the assessments can be inferred by analogy, using similar regulated contract; however, disputes that are at the boundary between law and financial calculation can spring up when coming to assessment of such agreements. One of the most debated and interesting events involves the evaluation of the outstanding debt at a given epoch during the contract lifetime in the Italian legislative framework. Referring to an existing model which proposes to split the debt into three components (outstanding debt, damages and penalty); we have recently highlighted how this proposed decomposition settlement provides a simple and transparent procedure that is compatible with both financial and accounting perspective. In this paper, we extend the previous results and we show how the calculation and assessment of the components of the debt are relevant from two points of view: the owed in the course of a lawsuit; the financial accounting and reporting according to some accounting methodologies (n-balance-sheet, such as IFRS, and off-balance-sheet, such as Italian GAAP).","[Migliavacca, Alessandro; Puddu, Luigi; Tibiletti, Luisa; Uberti, Mariacristina] Univ Torino, Dept Management, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Migliavacca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dept Management, Turin, Italy.",alessandro.migliavacca@unito.it; luigi.puddu@unito.it; luisa.tibiletti@unito.it; mariacristina.uberti@unito.it,"Uberti, Mariacristina/HGB-8734-2022; Tibiletti, Luisa/L-2030-2015; Migliavacca, Alessandro/JNV-2995-2023","Uberti, Mariacristina/0000-0002-4556-4630; Migliavacca, Alessandro/0000-0002-9243-5102",,,,,18,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,609,618,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_37,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000037,0

The EU-ACP trade is analyzed in seven regional groups (Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, East African Community, Southern African Development Community, West Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific) separately. The EU has been negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with those groups of countries since 2008. The European Union is a major trading partner for ACP countries. However, it has been gradually losing its role as their most important trading partner for Asian giants. The EU dominates in trade with West Africa and the Caribbean countries. China and India have been more important trading partners for Eastern and Southern Africa since 2007, Pacific (2009), East African Community and Southern African Development Community (2010), and Central Africa (2014). Moreover, the Asian giants' trade with 80 ACP countries has been surpassing the EU-ACP trade since 2012.

Because it has damaged the fragile equilibrium in the region, international community has adopted a sanction of different character.

Specifically, we develop a generalized analytical framework by introducing the contest success function. On the one hand, the central government can give the optimal political promotion benefits to local officials to incentivize them to exert desirable developmental efforts. On the other hand, the central government can undertake a further design of the political promotion system to motivate local officials via its assigned incentive strengths to the corresponding group and other groups, or via its stipulated number of comparable regions in the corresponding group. Our main findings in terms of the local official's assigned weight to the political benefit are as follows. First, the individual developmental effort and the summed developmental efforts are increasing in the local official's assigned weight to the political benefit. Second, the central government's assigned incentive strength to other groups is increasing in the local official's assigned weight to the political benefit. Third, the central government's assigned incentive strength to the corresponding group is decreasing in the local official's assigned weight to the political benefit.

Yet, since the 1980s, a secondary market regime' in sovereign bonds has transformed financial geographies and legal practices, facilitating the build-up of riskier sovereign debts and strengthening specialized distressed debt investors. This secondary market fix' has enabled the international financial system to muddle through successive crises. Using the recently concluded Argentine debt saga as an example, I show how the secondary market regime's effects on debtors are intertwined with, but distinct from, those of structural adjustment programmes; in cases of resistance to neoliberalism, deep' secondary market debt structures serve to push countries (back) into the neoliberal fold.","[Potts, Shaina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Potts, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",spotts@geog.ucla.edu,,,Society of Woman Geographers National Fellowship; Gray Brechin and Robert Chlebowski Endowed Graduate Student Support Fund in Geography Award,Society of Woman Geographers National Fellowship; Gray Brechin and Robert Chlebowski Endowed Graduate Student Support Fund in Geography Award,"This research was supported, in part, by the Society of Woman Geographers National Fellowship and by The Gray Brechin and Robert Chlebowski Endowed Graduate Student Support Fund in Geography Award.",,61,10,12,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In this manner, by subsidizing the overall cost of public transport companies has led to a constantly growing financial effort for the local authority, in particular because there are no clear policies regarding the destination, volume and socio-economical effects of this subsidy. Likewise, in the absence of clear methodologies and procedures for correct identification and quantification of the volume and destination of the subsidy needed for operating the public passenger transport services, it's financing is done in a relative subjective manner. In this paper we propose to bring to the fore a number of conceptual and procedural elements regarding a more correct approach on the volume and destination of operational subsidies granted to the public transport companies.

Moreover many recent studies has focused on the corporate sustainability concept and performance measurement interconnection. The aim of this paper is to identify the relationship between selected management tools and concepts of various development phases of strategic performance measurement systems to overall business performance measured by indicator ROE. Similarly the aim is to identify the relationship between the sustainability index and indicator ROE as a key aspect in terms of the current climate crisis. Our most important findings bring new information and knowledge for the strategic transformation from traditional business performance measurement system to strategic and sustainable performance measurement system. Specifically we found out that the BSC methodology has a demonstrable impact on the business performance. Also KPI system and orientation on the environment affect the performance of enterprises. In the case that companies do not have the knowledge information system as a complex system and do not take into account its implementation they tended to have a lower level of performance. This means that the BI knowledge information system has a major impact on business performance. Regarding to the corporate sustainability concept we can confirm that the direct moderate correlation is apparent between economic sub-index and also composite index of sustainable development and indicator of ROE. The connection of environmental and social sub-index separately to ROE had not been shown sufficiently. Based on results we can conclude that the index of sustainable development is a challenge for enterprises reflecting a growing need for change purely short-term oriented, consumerist patterns of production and consumption.","[Rajnoha, Rastislav] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Ind Engn & Informat Syst, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Lesnikova, Petra] Tech Univ, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Krajcik, Vladimir] Pan European Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Technical University Zvolen; Pan-European University,"Rajnoha, R (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Ind Engn & Informat Syst, Zlin, Czech Republic.",rajnoha@fame.utb.cz; lesnikova@tuzvo.sk; vladimir.krajcik@paneurouni.com,"Krajčík, Vladimír/HJI-0370-2023; Lesníková, Petra/DNZ-9165-2022; Rajnoha, Ing.

Analyses were done applying hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) due to the use of variables in different levels of analysis (firm level and regional level). Interestingly, the results showed that African firms don't differ in terms of their innovation, growth and internationalization level with the Protestant world but, if innovate, African companies expect less growth and internationalization from their innovation.

However, practices show that ICT, having influence on economic growth and sustainable development, appear to have certain drawbacks. It is extremely important to note that their positive and negative characteristics are not only economic, but social and ecological. To maximize positive effects and neutralize drawbacks, ICT should be managed by government, businesses and societies together. The ICT market growing quickly, ICT use is expanding in businesses, public administration, and social developments. Along with these ongoing processes, there are studies which are being developed at both the national and region levels in Russia.

This further analysis found that there is positive relationship between fiscal decentralization and economic growth in low level of economically developing countries and no relationship in high level of economically developed countries. These results suggested that fiscal decentralization is not always instrument for promotion of economic growth, which means that country's economic development level is an important factor when introducing reform of fiscal decentralization.

A PROPOSAL OF METHODOLOGICAL SOLUTION,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inflation forecast; inflation forecast targeting; inflation forecast targeting measurement,MONETARY-POLICY; TRANSPARENCY; INDEPENDENCE; EXPECTATIONS,"The paper offers a methodological solution to measuring inflation forecast targeting (IFT). IFT is a central bank's procedure which consists in: producing its own inflation forecast, revealing its results and making interest rates decisions on the basis of the forecast. Inflation forecast targeting is implemented, to some extent, by any central bank implementing inflation targeting framework. It facilitates the forward-looking attitude of the central banker. This forward-lookingness facilitates the expectations shaping and goals achievement. The literature on IFT is broad but it does not cover a concise framework for IFT analysis and measurement. The following contribution fills in this gap. It presents the IFT index. The idea of its elaboration is in line with any monetary policy qualitative aspects measurement: 5 aspects of IFT are distinguished, each of which having a system of points attribution described. These aspects are: forecasting methodology, declaration on the forecast role in the monetary policy, forecast publication, actual central bank's practice and ex post forecast evaluation. Actual central bank's practice covers the assessment of the central bank's decision compatibility with the message of the forecast. The multivariate scheme of assessment which considers central bank's flexibility in the decision making process - guaranteed by the framework of the inflation targeting - is elaborated. The other IFT aspects' evaluations consist in the analysis of the information revealed. The IFT can be divided into two sub indices: one covering only the forecasting system transparency and the other one - for decisions compatibility check. The IFT index and sub-indices are universal in the sense of considering the IFT broadly on the basis of various central bank's practice. The index can be used to cross-country and over time comparison - such an example is also presented in the paper. It also makes it possible to verify the hypotheses on the central banks' consistency in implementing IFT - measured by IFT index - and the central banks' performance.","[Szyszko, Magdalena] WSB Poznan, Sch Banking, Finance & Banking Fac, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",,"Szyszko, M (通讯作者)，WSB Poznan, Sch Banking, Finance & Banking Fac, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland.",magdalena.szyszko@wsb.poznan.pl,"Szyszko, Magdalena/AAC-9666-2019","Szyszko, Magdalena/0000-0002-5322-3334",National Science Center [2011/03/B/HS4/03705],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",The contribution presents the results of research financed by the National Science Center: Interdependences of Inflation Forecasts and Inflation Expectations of Market Participants.

To investigate the determinants of a directional imbalance in freight rates, we show that a deviation between front-and back-haul freight rates depends on both density economies and directional imbalances in transport flows. Using panel data on truck freight transportation in Japan, we find that a 10% increase in the front-haul transport flow relative to back-haul transport flow leads to a 1.3% decrease in the front-haul freight rate relative to back-haul freight rate. This suggests that the negative effect of density economies in front-haul transport flow dominates the positive effects of both density economies in back-haul transport flow and the directional imbalance in transport flows.","[Tanaka, Kiyoyasu; Tsubotay, Kenmei] JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Chiba, Chiba, Japan",,"Tsubotay, K (通讯作者)，JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",kenmei_tsubota@ide.go.jp,,"TSUBOTA, KENMEI/0000-0001-5192-1860",Institute of Developing Economies; JSPS [26285058]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285058] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Institute of Developing Economies; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We acknowledge financial support from the Institute of Developing Economies and JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) Grant Number 26285058.,,17,7,7,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

The paper studies P2P lending and the determinants of Non-performing Loans (NPLs). Compared with traditional loans, lenders in P2P should bear higher credit risks because of information asymmetry since they are at a disadvantage position facing the borrowers. NPLs are the direct financial lost for borrowers. It is important to clarify the key factors of NPLs for the lenders and establish a reliable model to judge whether a loan will turn to be NPL or Not based on the published information in the platform.

A Non parametric Random Forest (RF) model which has superiority in dealing with complex multidimensional data set and higher predicts accuracy has been applied to determine the factors of NPLs.

The level of service standards were defined using Law of Successive Interval Scaling based on data collected from 2000 travelers in Kolkata city. As premium and ordinary bus services are predominantly used by choice riders (private car owners) and captive riders (non-car owners) respectively, LOS standards of these two services were defined based on the perception of choice and captive riders. The result shows a substantial difference in the perception of captive and choice riders which justifies the need for having distinct service standards for ordinary and premium services. The study also evaluated the level of service of a few premium and ordinary routes based on the developed service standards. The evaluation indicated that while the premium buses are introduced to attract the choice riders, a majority of them are operating below the expected service levels and thus, unable to fulfil the requirements of choice riders. The LOS standards developed in the present work may be used judiciously by the transit planners and service providers for improvement of premium and ordinary bus service in Kolkata city. Although the level of service standards developed in the present work are city specific, the work is of interest to the policy makers of public transport as several emerging countries are experiencing rapid urbanization and public transport has to play a dual role to serve the mobility needs of marginally weaker segments (captive riders) and act as a demand management instrument to attract choice riders.","[Cheranchery, Munavar Fairooz; Maitra, Bhargab] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Maitra, B (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",fairoozmunavarc@gmail.com; bhargab@civil.iitkgp.ac.in,"Cheranchery, Munavar Fairooz/AAZ-3179-2021","Maitra, Bhargab/0000-0003-2083-9930","Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India [4-22/2014-TS.I]","Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India(Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India)","The authors would like to acknowledge Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, for funding this research work (Grant number 4-22/2014-TS.I).",,34,8,8,2,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Final demand is affected by consumer foresight, that is, consumers may not anticipate the ex post surplus from the secondary good when purchasing the primary good. We first set up a reduced-form platform model and evaluate the effects of consumer foresight on the platform's optimal decisions. Then, we specialize the analysis in the context of airports, which derive revenues from both aeronautical and, increasingly, commercial activities. An airport sets landing fees and, in addition, it chooses the retail market structure by selecting the number of retail concessions to be awarded. We find that, with perfectly myopic consumers, the airport chooses to attract more passengers via low landing fees, and also sets the minimum possible number of retailers in order to increase the concessions' revenues. However, even a very small amount of anticipation of the consumer surplus from retail activities changes significantly the airport's choices: the optimal policy is dependent on the degree of differentiation in the retail market.

This attracts passengers and it is exploited by the airport by charging higher landing fees, which then constitute the largest share of its profits.

J,"Gal-Or, E",,,,"Gal-Or, Esther",,,Peer-to-peer sharing in the lodging market: Evaluating implications for social welfare and profitability,JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMY; PRICE,"With a focus on the lodging market, we investigate the nature of competition between a peer-to-peer platform and a traditional lodging provider (hotel), in an environment where both possess the market power to affect the final lodging price established in the market. To understand such an environment, we investigate the strategy choices of the three types of players active in this market: the platform, the hotel, and individuals in the population who consider supplying or demanding lodging capacity. We use our analysis to predict how the emergence of the peer-to-peer platform affects the profits of the hotel and the welfare of consumers. We characterize two types of equilibria: Partial Coverage and Full Coverage. The former type arises if each individual's demand for lodging while on vacation is relatively low in comparison to her supply. In this case, the level of demand originating from vacationers is insufficient to make it worthwhile for the platform to lower its service fee in order to attract capacity from every individual in the population. In contrast, when the demand for lodging while on vacation is relatively high, it may become profitable for the platform to implement the Full Coverage equilibrium, in which case every individual supplies lodging capacity to the platform. We demonstrate that the entry of the platform to the market will definitely increase the consumer surplus if the platform chooses to implement the Full Coverage equilibrium. At the Partial Coverage equilibrium, the consumer surplus might actually decline upon the entry of the platform. This might happen because the entry of the platform can sometimes lead to higher lodging prices, and as a result, can hurt individuals when vacationing. Because the entry of the platform raises the income of individuals in the economy, their willingness to pay for lodging while on vacation may rise. Such higher prices may also sometimes lead to higher profits for the hotel, in spite of the competition with the platform. In the special case that individuals experience no disutility when offering a portion of their housing space to the platform because this space has no alternative use for the individual, the entry of the platform will always lead to higher consumer welfare and lower profits for the hotel, irrespective of whether Full or Partial Coverage arises as equilibrium.","[Gal-Or, Esther] Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Gal-Or, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Katz Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",esther@katz.pitt.edu,,,,,,,19,4,5,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The paper first describes briefly what Jules Dupuit saw: the transport sector in Europe in the mid-1800s. It then presents and discusses what he said On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works, and On Tolls and Transport Charges, his seminal works published in 1844 and 1894. Dupuit covers a wide array of topics: Identification of benefits; Consumer surplus (termed relative utility); Price discrimination; Product quality and Method of manufacture; Efficiency and distribution of benefits; and Role of the State in the railways. Dupuit's guiding words for these complicated issues is concise: The only utility is that which people are willing to pay for. This is illustrated with a graphical and numerical example how Dupuit's benefit-cost analysis might be applied today. The paper concludes with enumeration of Jules Dupuit's lasting contributions to the economic analysis in the transport sector.","[Talvitie, Antti] Aalto Univ, Espoo, Finland",Aalto University,"Talvitie, A (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Espoo, Finland.",antti.talvitie@aalto.fi,,,,,,,18,7,7,0,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

J,"Purdy, LM",,,,"Purdy, Lillian M.",,,"Mary Griffith's Three Hundred Years Hence: Utopia, Women, and Marriage",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Mary Griffith's Three Hundred Years Hence (1836) is the first attempt by an American woman to create a literary utopia. With this work, Griffith begins a literary conversation on women and marriage, including women's rights and gender equality, and she imagines new laws and reforms that strengthen marriages, married life, and family satisfaction. Griffith's work situates marriage as an integral part of a successful environment and imagines solutions to national concerns regarding women that will be addressed later in the century. Griffith tackles slavery, alcoholism, and divorce laws, as well as issues that directly affected married women, particularly white married women. In the novel, women have earned equality without negatively affecting domesticity or female purity. Women's daily lives are improved, educational opportunities are opened to women, children's lives are valued in the new community, and order in the home and community serve as the basis for utopia. Griffith's vision is bold even as it is limited because, while women are often the creative minds behind the utopian improvements that are described, in the plot itself, women are silent. Other weaknesses in the plot include the oversimplified solution to slavery and the ambiguous resolution of the fate of Native Americans within the utopia. Tragically, in her vision, Griffith has eliminated both groups from the community. Griffith mixes futuristic technological improvements with biting commentary on contemporary social issues and the treatment of women. Griffith uses the genre of utopian vision to present solutions to many challenges facing 19(th)-century white women.","[Purdy, Lillian M.] Louisiana Coll, English, Pineville, LA 71360 USA; [Purdy, Lillian M.] Louisiana Coll, Bridge Program, Pineville, LA 71360 USA",,"Purdy, LM (通讯作者)，Louisiana Coll, English, Pineville, LA 71360 USA.;Purdy, LM (通讯作者)，Louisiana Coll, Bridge Program, Pineville, LA 71360 USA.",lillian.purdy@lacollege.edu,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

After documenting variation in mode choice, urban form, and vehicle ownership, we fit a multinomial logit model to data from 2.5 million commuters who reported a work commute on the 2015 Intercensus. We estimate whether a person commutes by transit, car, or walking/biking as a function of commuters' gender, age, employment status, household income, and seven measures of urban form and transportation supply. Across urban areas, commuters are less likely to drive in dense urban areas where jobs are spatially concentrated jobs and near population centers. Commuters are also less likely to drive in areas with better public transit supply and less roadway. Collectively the measures of urban form are as strongly related to the probability someone commutes to work by car as household income. Population density plays a particularly strongly role with an estimated elasticity four times as strong as recent studies from US urban areas. Taken together, our findings suggest that land use planning and transportation investments can and do influence commute patterns. Recent public policies have almost certainly contributed to increased, rather than decreased driving and associated congestion, pollution, and traffic fatalities.","[Guerra, Erick] Univ Penn, Sch Design, Dept City & Reg Planning, 210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Caudillo, Camilo; Montejano, Jorge] AC CentroGeo CONACYT, Ctr Invest Ciencias Informac Geoespacial, Contoy 137 Esq Chemax, Col Lomas De Padierna 14240, Delegacion Tlal, Mexico; [Monkkonen, Paavo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Urban Planning, 337 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Guerra, E (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Sch Design, Dept City & Reg Planning, 210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",erickg@upenn.edu; ccaudillo@centrogeo.edu.mx; paavo.monkkonen@ucla.edu; jmontejano@centrogeo.edu.mx,"Monkkonen, Paavo/B-7935-2010; Caudillo, Camilo/ITU-7881-2023; Caudillo, Camilo/D-5026-2013; Montejano-Escamilla, Jorge Alberto/B-2249-2017","Caudillo, Camilo/0000-0002-2450-5295; Guerra, Erick/0000-0002-7769-2581; Monkkonen, Paavo/0000-0002-3513-0230; Montejano-Escamilla, Jorge Alberto/0000-0002-6914-1229",Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions (CM2) University Transportation Center,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; Cooperative Mobility for Competitive Megaregions (CM2) University Transportation Center,"This paper builds on a report funded by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (Montejano et al. 2018): We are grateful for comments received from anonymous reviewers, Lincoln Institute staff, and participants at a joint Berkeley and Lincoln Institute conference on transit technologies in Latin American cities in May, 2017.

We present evidence from the 2008 Democratic Party nomination race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton showing that the answer is yes. Both cross-sectional and time series evidence suggests that market prices contain information about election outcomes that polls taken shortly before the contests do not. Conversely, election surprises relative to polls too Granger cause subsequent price movements. We then investigate whether the additional information in prices could come from the media coverage of these campaigns, and uncover a set of complex relationships between pollster's surprise, price movements, and various aspects of media coverage. Prices anticipate the balance and content of media coverage, but not the volume. On the other hand, it is the volume of media coverage, not the balance or content, that anticipates the surprise element in election outcomes. Moreover, Granger causality between prices and election surprises barely changes after controlling for media coverage, and causality from media volume to surprises persists too after controlling for price movements. Taken together, the results suggest that both prices and the volume of media coverage contain independent election-relevant information that is not captured in polls.

By defining an escort-space model using the spatial relationships between home, the workplace, and school, this study focuses on the daily modal split among parental chauffeurs using data from Qujing, China, while focusing on the effects of different escort-space models: spatial aggregation, job-housing separation and school-housing separation. The descriptive statistics of parental chauffeurs' travel mode choices under the influences of these three escort-space models are presented. The statistical results demonstrate that the modal splits of parental chauffeurs perform significantly differently under these three escort-space models. Furthermore, the determinants of the daily travel mode of parental chauffeurs, including escort-spaces and other selected variables, are investigated using a multinomial logit model. A model without the escort-space model is also presented for comparison. The results show that the model with the escort-space model has a more significant goodness-of-fit than the model without the escort-space model. Both the job-housing separation and school-housing separation of parental chauffeurs result in the increase of car trips, while the usage amount of car in daily journeys is higher than that in escort trips. Moreover, car ownership, bike ownership, household income, residential location, age, gender, income, and education level all significantly impact the daily travel mode choices of parental chauffeurs. These findings can help policymakers create suitable policies to reduce excessive car trips by parental chauffeurs.","[Liu, Yang; Shi, Zhuangbin] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yanjie] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Baohong] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Chenggong Campus, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiyang] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Kunming University of Science & Technology; University of Leeds,"Ji, YJ (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Sipailou 2, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kmliuyang@seu.edu.cn; jiyanjie@seu.edu.cn; shizhuangbin@gmail.com; haoziyy@sina.com; tsql@leeds.ac.uk,"li, yang/IQV-3559-2023; Liu, Qiyang/GRX-2678-2022","Liu, Qiyang/0000-0003-0953-7050; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-7863-9371",Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135003]; Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51338003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KYLX16_0270]; Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University [YBJJ1842]; EPSRC [EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The financial support from the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51561135003), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51338003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. KYLX16_0270) and the Research Foundation of Graduated School of Southeast University (No. YBJJ1842) are gratefully acknowledged.",,48,18,19,7,52,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were combinations of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a hybrid approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method's average sMAPE was close to 10% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naive2.

This may be because a distinction between the institutional factors that generate an individual's desire to become an entrepreneur and those that generate a motivation that actually leads to entrepreneurial action has not been considered sufficiently. Aim: This work is an attempt to respond to the following question on the basis of the individual's perception of regulative, normative and cognitive institutions: In developing economies, what institutional factors generate an entrepreneurial motivation that makes individuals desire to become entrepreneurs and what factors cause an entrepreneurial motivation that actually leads them to entrepreneurial action? Setting: We use empirical evidence from the African nation of Cape Verde for the analysis. The study was carried out on 6 of the 10 islands of the archipelago. Method: The sample of study comprises 237 people: 93 entrepreneurs and 144 individuals with different levels of desire to become an entrepreneur. We used multiple linear regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Results: Our findings show that institutional factors which generate the entrepreneurial motivation that forges an individual's desire to become an entrepreneur, and those which generate the motivation that leads him or her to actually set up his or her own business are not the same. We also find differences in the institutional factors that influence the opportunity, necessity and social components of entrepreneurial motivation. Conclusion: Theoretical implications for better understanding the factors that condition entrepreneurship in developing economies and practical implications useful for improving the planning of growth in these countries are offered.","[Garcia-Cabrera, Antonia M.; Garcia-Soto, Maria G.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Business Adm, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Dias-Furtado, Jeremias] ECOWAS, Praia, Cape Verde",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Garcia-Cabrera, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Business Adm, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",antonia.garcia@ulpgc.es,"Garcia-Cabera, Antonia Mercedes/ABB-8272-2021; García-Soto, María Gracia/G-1219-2016","Garcia-Cabera, Antonia Mercedes/0000-0001-9150-7998;","Spain's Economy, Industry and Competitiveness National Department [ECO2016-80518-R]","Spain's Economy, Industry and Competitiveness National Department","Financial support from Spain's Economy, Industry and Competitiveness National Department (Project: ECO2016-80518-R) is gratefully acknowledged.",,50,7,7,2,7,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It took several years following deregulation in 1986, compounded by wholesale changes in the ownership of bus operators, for new, stable, mature relationships to develop between operators and local transport authorities. The building of partnership working, founded on common interests of encouraging greater accessibility by bus, increasing patronage, and modal shift from cars - with their consequent social, economic and environmental benefits has underpinned some impressive achievements over the last 25 years. We examine the role of partnerships in enabling and sustaining improvements in service quality and supply, and securing additional investment in network resources and facilities. This reflects lengthy direct experience of developing the partnership concept with authorities and operators and working through the variety of challenges. Added to this experience, we draw on 2015 data obtained from across Britain while revising the relevant government guidance. We consider the benefits of and obstacles to partnership, the mechanisms and components of successful partnerships, and the lessons from less successful implementations. Finally, we look at more recent changes in the partnership landscape.","[Godfrey, John; Taylor, John] TAS Partnership Ltd, 59-61 Guildhall St, Preston PR1 3NU, Lancs, England",,"Godfrey, J (通讯作者)，TAS Partnership Ltd, 59-61 Guildhall St, Preston PR1 3NU, Lancs, England.",john.godfrey@taspartnership.com; john.taylor@taspartnership.com,,,,,,,8,3,3,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The answer developed is that litigants will naturally a great deal about their specific matter, whereas a court will ordinarily little except to the degree that the court has already invested effort to appreciate it.

These four mechanisms, i.e. ownership/instruction, contracts, partnerships, and mutual understanding, are all based on basic coordination mechanisms of markets, hierarchies, and networks. A case of timetable planning is examined, because inter-organisational coordination between actors is crucial in this field, and the usefulness of the typology is illustrated via three examples. The results stem from a Danish study of institutional constraints on timetable optimisation in inter-organisational relations.

The aim of this paper is to see to what extent PTAs are using CBA at the time of the survey, and investigate whether there are any changes with the previous study. A survey was sent to all Swedish PTAs with questions regarding current, previous, and projected future use of CBA. Questions about knowledge of reference materials and why the organization use (or do not use) CBA was asked. The main result is that most PTAs are not using CBA as decision support. For those that do, the method is used mostly for investments in payment systems and major line or traffic changes. The PTAs seem not regard a lack of economic resources a reason for not using CBA. Rather, lack of knowledge and more reliance on other types of decision support are the reasons.","[Vigren, Andreas] VTI, Box 55685, S-10210 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ljungberg, Anders] Transport Anal, Torsgatan 30, S-11321 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Vigren, A (通讯作者)，VTI, Box 55685, S-10210 Stockholm, Sweden.",andreas.vigren@vti.se; anders.ljungberg@trafa.se,,"Vigren, Andreas/0000-0002-9219-8493",Centre for Transport Studies,Centre for Transport Studies,"Thank you to Roger Pyddoke for reading and commenting on the paper, participants at an internal review seminar, participants at the Thredbo 15 conference in Stockholm, and to anonymous referees.

Complexities in work procedures create complications in the application of procedures for completing tasks. Recent trends in the Auditor General's report have demonstrated the metastasising culture of non-compliance to work procedures in municipalities in South Africa. Research, as well as the audit outcomes for the Eastern Cape in particular, is a testament to this assertion. Therefore, there is no need to make work more complex. Aim: To ascertain whether the application of Taylorism in the workplace could improve performance and to access the utilisation of work procedure in municipalities in the Eastern Cape. Setting: This study was carried out using quantitative data collected from a District Municipality and its five local municipalities at the Transkei area of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Method: A survey completed by 593 municipality workers (junior workers) was collected and analysed using statistical methods and triangulation. Results: Findings from the article reveals that work procedures in the organisation might be old and archaic. It may be relevant to workers who have little or no interference from externalities with regard to their job commitments. It recommends that those officials that perform routinised functions in municipalities should use a work procedure manual when completing their task. Based on the notion that work procedures engender compliance, increase outcome and output, increase productivity, save time, reduce stress and organisational friction or conflict in organisations. Conclusion: It concludes that procedures that are comprehensible (simple), accessible (organically inputted and communicated) and accurate (effectively designed) will improve the daily functionality of lower echelon staff in the municipalities, especially those requiring little or no external influence on the completion of a task.","[Ndaguba, Emeka A.; Ijeoma, Edwin C.] IDAM, Bhisho, South Africa; [Ndaguba, Emeka A.; Nzewi, Ogochukwu I.; Ijeoma, Edwin C.; Sambumbu, Matemba; Sibanda, Modeni M.] Univ Ft Hare, Sch Govt & Publ Adm, Alice, South Africa",University of Fort Hare,"Ndaguba, EA (通讯作者)，IDAM, Bhisho, South Africa.;Ndaguba, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Ft Hare, Sch Govt & Publ Adm, Alice, South Africa.",endaguba@ufh.ac.za,"Ndaguba, Emeka/R-2389-2019; Nzewi, Ogochukwu I/B-2777-2019","Ndaguba, Emeka/0000-0002-7447-5565; Nzewi, Ogochukwu/0000-0002-2377-0855",,,,,37,5,7,1,9,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Total costs are a sum of user cost and agency cost. In previous work, we explored in various hypothetical city scenarios possible tradeoffs between GHG emissions and total costs for optimally designed transit systems. However, most current transit systems were not designed to minimize total costs. This study aims at finding the potential emission impact when optimizing the total costs of such a system, the MUNI bus network for the city of San Francisco. The continuum approximation (CA) method is used to obtain a stylized representation of the network. Total costs and emissions are derived as functions of system attributes such as headways and spacing. We analyze the optimal total costs and emissions and the corresponding attributes. Our result shows that a significant reduction in GHG emissions is achieved when total costs are reduced simultaneously. The cost optimal MUNI bus system has a total cost of 0.15 billion $/year and emits 1 680 metric tons of greenhouse gases. These figures amount to about half of the cost and a third of the emissions in the current MUNI bus system. The optimal system has a lower spatial availability but a higher temporal availability of bus service than the current system, which highlights the potential benefits of providing more frequent express bus services.","[Cheng, Han; Mao, Chao; Horvath, Arpad] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Madanat, Samer] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; New York University Abu Dhabi,"Cheng, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",chengh09@berkeley.edu; chaomao@berkeley.edu; samer.madanat@nyu.edu; horvath@ce.berkeley.edu,,"Madanat, Samer/0000-0002-6939-2933; Cheng, Han/0000-0002-9124-016X",UC CONNECT Faculty Research Grant [TO-65A0529]; Xenel Professorship funds,UC CONNECT Faculty Research Grant; Xenel Professorship funds,This research was funded by a UC CONNECT Faculty Research Grant (TO-65A0529) and by the Xenel Professorship funds of the third author.,,42,9,10,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The daily contacts (with family, friends, schoolmates, co-workers, clubmates, and others), duration of activities by type, and travel time are the endogenous variables of the system. Life-cycle stages, day of the week, and accessibility are the exogenous variables. The model finds life-cycle dependent roles in interpersonal interactions and intra-household contacts and friends are significant in explaining service, shopping, home-leisure, and out of home social activity durations. Moreover, the many significant indirect paths of this model show we should include human interactions and paths of influence in activity models. We also compare the direct and indirect influence between two models, one that includes number of daily contacts and a second model without daily contacts. Three groups are found as the most sensitive in allocation of time when controlling for daily contacts and they are children younger than 17 years, persons in home duties, and college students. In addition, allocation of time to discretionary activities is the most sensitive to specifications that control for number of daily contacts.","[Lee, Jae Hyun] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lee@geog.ucsb.edu; goulias@geog.ucsb.edu,"Lee, Jae Hyun/ABH-9059-2020","Lee, Jae Hyun/0000-0003-4007-7048; Goulias, Konstadinos/0000-0002-7436-9447",,,,,44,3,3,0,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

As road safety improvements in Europe have decreased the number of fatalities, more focus has been directed to seriously injured. The aim of this study is to compare the different definitions of and international data on seriously injured, combine this data with fatality data and investigate the results and the conclusions for road safety policy. Particularly, a combined indicator of killed and seriously injured (KSI) is used in analysis. For comparing the amount of seriously injured in different countries, the definition recommended by the European Commission, the Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) level 3+ was adapted. Based on the comparisons the use of a KSI indicator is recommended as it widens overall awareness of road safety performance. When analysing the amount of seriously injured and KSI, the results highlight bicycle, moped and motorcycle users compared to fatalities as an indicator. As sustainable mobility and urbanisation shape the future transport systems and increase the importance of cycling, adopting KSI indicator is increasingly important, but further research is needed to identify the best practices and define guidelines for gathering, reporting and analysing international data on seriously injured.","[Utriainen, Roni; Pollanen, Markus; Liimatainen, Heikki] Tampere Univ Technol, Transport Res Ctr Verne, POB 527, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Utriainen, R (通讯作者)，Tampere Univ Technol, Transport Res Ctr Verne, POB 527, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland.",roni.utriainen@tut.fi; markus.pollanen@tut.fi; heikki.liimatainen@tut.fi,,"Pollanen, Markus/0000-0001-6534-8380; Liimatainen, Heikki Ilari/0000-0001-7453-6594; Utriainen, Roni/0000-0002-2466-9660",,,,,49,13,13,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The analysis demonstrates significant variations in both retailer management practices and strategic responses by suppliers between the two products. These variations, in turn, are seen to derive from the inherent nature of the commodities concerned, the relative balance of supply and demand, and the pre-existing competitive and structural conditions in the different sectors before retail TNC entry. Overall, the paper calls for a nuanced and dynamic approach to retailer power and its impacts that recognises the complexity and unevenness of supply network restructuring in emerging markets.","[Wang, Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yue] Jiangsu Acad Innovat Strategy, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Coe, Neil M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS; National University of Singapore","Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Jiangsu Acad Innovat Strategy, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yuewang@niglas.ac.cn; geonmc@nus.edu.sg,"Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401131, 41271136]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M561721]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),We would like to thank two anonymous referees and the editor for their very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this article.

Aim: It examines whether self-motivation of business owners operating in the furniture manufacturing sector has an influence on SME growth. Setting: Of the 127 SMEs operating in the eThekwini District Municipality, 112 participated in the study representing 88% of the target population. Methods: Descriptive, chi-square and correlative analyses were used to test the two objectives. That is, to determine the influence of self-motivation of business owners for SME growth, as well as to establish the intrinsic motivational factors that stimulate creativity for SME growth. Results: The study revealed that the intrinsic motivational factors of business owners do influence SME growth in SA. These factors include exerting effort for business growth interest, finding new solutions to business problems to achieve growth, growing business for recognition, belief to produce the desired outcomes, taking responsibilities for business expansion, the need for advancement, and growth aspiration that enables the business owner to take risks in order to grow the business. Conclusion: The outcome is that a self-motivated business owner has the ability to grow the business. The study provides valuable data relating to intrinsic motivational factors. Such factors are the enablers of creativity and business growth. It provides initial baseline data upon which to base future work.","[Ncube, Thandukwazi R.; Zondo, Robert W.

J,"Dippenaar, M",,,,"Dippenaar, Mareli",,,A critical analysis of the meaning of the term 'value' in Section 30(6)(e) of the Companies Act,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Sections 30(4) and 30(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (the Act) require, inter alia, disclosure of the remuneration received by each director in a company's annual financial statements. Section 30(6) defines the term 'remuneration', which includes, inter alia, in Section 30(6)(e) the 'value' of any option or right granted to a director, as contemplated in Section 42, which deals with options for the allotment or subscription of securities or shares of a company. It is uncertain what the intended meaning of the term 'value' is in this context and it is interpreted differently by different companies in practice. Aim: The objective of this study was to understand the meaning of the term 'value' in Section 30(6)(e) of the Act (including the date of measurement thereof), as intended by the legislature. Setting: This article examined existing literature in a South African corporate and legislative environment. Method: A non-empirical study of existing literature was conducted by performing a historical analysis within a South African context. A doctrinal research approach was followed. Results: Possible interpretations of the term 'value' include the grant date fair value of the rights, the fair value at reporting date, the fair value on vesting date, the expense calculated in terms of the International Financial Reporting Standard on share-based payments, the gain on exercise of the rights and the intrinsic value on reporting date. It is submitted that the most likely meaning is the grant date fair value. Conclusion: It was found that the meaning of the term 'value', for purposes of Section 30(6)(e) of the Act, is unclear and interpreted differently by different companies. It is, therefore, recommended that the wording of Section 30(6)(e) is amended to reflect the meaning intended by the legislature.","[Dippenaar, Mareli] Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Dippenaar, M (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",lagrange@sun.ac.za,,"Dippenaar, Mareli/0000-0002-1589-0187",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Aims: The main objective of the study is to understand the relationship between internal corporate governance and company performance from the perspective of three distinct economic periods, as well as industry nuances, cognisant of endogeneity issues. Setting: South Africa, as an emerging African market, offers an interesting research context in which the corporate governance and financial performance nexus can be examined empirically. Method: A sample of 90 companies from the five largest South African industries, covering a 13-year period from 2002 to 2014 (1170 firm-year observations) was examined with three estimation approaches. Results: Two key trends emerged from this study. First, the relationship between corporate governance and company performance differed from industry to industry. Second, the association between corporate governance and company performance also changes during steady and non-steady periods, which is an indication that the nexus is driven by the state of the global economy and the type of the industry. Conclusion: Evidence from the study suggests that companies should be allowed to optimise rather than maximise their corporate governance options. This finding questioned the approach of the recently published King IV Code of Good Corporate Governance, which requires Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies to 'apply and explain' as opposed to 'apply or explain' as pronounced by King III Code of Good Corporate Governance.","[Tshipa, Jonty; Brummer, Leon M.; Wolmarans, Hendrik; du Toit, Elda] Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Tshipa, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Dept Financial Management, Pretoria, South Africa.",tshipaj@gmail.com,"du Toit, Elda/D-5304-2013","du Toit, Elda/0000-0001-8386-7969",,,,,88,5,8,0,12,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This influence stems not only from the way market participants behave but also from risk metrics used and regulatory capital amassed and released during bust and boom periods, respectively. The introduction of the regulatory Countercyclical Capital Buffer aims to thwart procyclicality by accumulating (releasing) capital in upswings (downswings), subsequently reducing the amplitude of the financial cycle and promoting macroprudential stability. The timing of the accumulation and release of buffer capital is critical so identifying accurate indicators is important. Aim: This paper applies a Kalman filter to South African data and confirms the procyclicality of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) proposal. Setting: For South Africa, studies suggest alternatives such as residential property indices because research has demonstrated that the BCBS proposal is procyclical rather than countercyclical. Methods: This paper applies a Kalman filter to South African data and compares the results obtained with those filtered using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Results: Results indicate that buffer signals are dependent upon the filter employed. Conclusion: Buffer signals are strongly dependent upon the filter employed to detect procyclicality. The South African Reserve Bank and other regulators should reconsider the use of the Hodrick-Prescott filter and entertain the possibility of using the Kalman filter instead.","[Visser, Dirk; van Vuuren, Gary] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Visser, D (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",ddvisser13@gmail.com,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,66,1,1,0,3,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The present work investigates whether the increase in fiscal pressure leads to a higher level of corruption and whether the results differ from developed to developing countries. This article examines a large sample consisting of over 185 countries, during the period 2005-2014. The technique employed was short panel data. Five statistical models were used such as the pooled OLS, pooled FGLS, within model, between model and random-effects GLS model. Our main contribution consists in finding differentiated results of the influence of fiscal policy on the level of corruption among developed and developing countries. For developed countries, we found that, with high-quality institutions, low fiscal pressure leads to a lower level of corruption, which is in line with expectations. Conversely, in developing countries, with low-level institutional quality, low fiscal pressure increases corruption, because of low governance efficiency under which people may easily circumvent the law. Our findings suggest that governments and policy-makers need to acknowledge that the anti-corruption fight requires not only the right fiscal policies but also the right way of implementing these policies, recognising the role of quality institutions, which need to prevail in any country.","[Achim, Monica V.] Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Borlea, Sorin N.; Anghelina, Andrei M.] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Fac Econ Informat & Engn, Dept Econ, Arad, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,"Achim, MV (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",monica.achim@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Achim, Monica/C-5811-2017; Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/AAP-9288-2020","Achim, Monica/0000-0003-4701-041X; Borlea, Sorin Nicolae/0000-0002-9987-3682; Anghelina, Andrei Marius/0000-0001-9960-7029",,,,,37,5,5,0,22,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Concentration has been a public policy issue in the airline industry since deregulation, due to the long-standing airport dominance by major carriers, which is a concern that is recurrently intensified by merger announcements. This paper develops an empirical model to examine the evolution of concentration in the airline markets. We analyze the case of the Brazilian airline industry, in which the two major carriers acquired a combined market share of more than 90% in the late 2000s and have experienced a sharp reversion since then. We test hypotheses regarding the association of market concentration with market size and service quality, as well as the impacts of vertical relationships after airport privatization. Our results suggest that the entry-attraction effect of market size more than compensates for the economies-of-density effect, while the vertical product differentiation created by the strategic investment in capacity is a key driver of concentration in the airline industry.","[Oliveira, Marcus V.

We study the impact of these reforms on the efficiency levels of a panel of 17 European railways (2002-10). The novelty lies in the incorporation of a multi-dimensional rail regulation index capturing the complexity of regulatory powers and activities - into an econometric framework alongside other reform variables. Our results suggest that the cost-reducing benefits of regulatory reform depend on the degree of (actual or desired) market openness, vertical structure, and the intensity of network usage.","[Benedetto, Valerio] Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England; [Smith, Andrew S.

Assuming that the quality of transportation infrastructure policy affects the strength of inter-regional spillovers, we compare a one-step scheduling design, in which all policies are chosen simultaneously, with a two-step scheduling design, in which transportation infrastructure policy is used to influence local public goods policies. We show that decentralization failure could be partially solved with scheduling design. When regional governments correctly schedule their policies, citizens benefit from the same level of public goods but with lower taxes. Moreover, the two-step scheduling design results in a lower quality of transportation infrastructure and a higher intensity of local public goods. However, the overproduction of local public goods with positive externalities cannot be excluded.","[Feder, Christophe] Univ Vallee Aoste, Univ Valle Aosta, Grand Chemin 75-77, I-11020 St Christophe, Italy; [Feder, Christophe] Univ Turin, BRICK, Collegio Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",Universita Della Valle D'aosta; University of Turin,"Feder, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vallee Aoste, Univ Valle Aosta, Grand Chemin 75-77, I-11020 St Christophe, Italy.",c.feder1@univda.it,"Feder, Christophe/AHC-3437-2022","Feder, Christophe/0000-0002-1239-513X",,,,,94,7,7,1,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

Our three-stage least squares results show positive significant simultaneous interdependencies between performance and leverage. Performance reduction and debt levels increase are associated with activity diversification. Performance and leverage reduction is due to geographic diversification. Our estimation confirms reverse association between the interaction of diversification, leverage, and performance.

The indicator estimates a standardised rental index on a national, Dublin and outside of Dublin basis based on the 950,000 rental properties registered with the RTB. The provision in late 2016 of detailed geographical identifiers has enabled an alternative series of indicators to be estimated. In particular, hedonic rental indicators for 137 local electoral areas (LEAs) are now available on a quarterly basis from Q3 2007 to Q4 2016. By providing a more accurate assessment of regional trends in rental supply and demand, the indicators should enable a more precise implementation of policies in the rental market. They should also serve as a proxy for measuring underlying economic activity in these regions on an ongoing basis.","[Lawless, Martina; McQuinn, Kieran; Walsh, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Lawless, M (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",martina.lawless@esri.ie; kieran.mcquinn@esri.ie; john.walsh@esri.ie,"McQuinn, Kieran/JCE-1122-2023",,,,,,9,4,4,0,0,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

On the one hand, the extralegal powers of TNCs are legitimized with patronizing discourses about the incompetence of African nations in managing their own affairs and with the specter of a resource curse that supposedly immobilizes the self-governing capacities of Africans. On the other hand, TNCs arrogate to themselves statutory municipal power, ignore or manipulate various channels of accountability, and privately appropriate sociallycreated rents. Some critics of TNCs propose a withdrawal from globalization or greater regulation to limit the power of TNCs. But protectionist or isolationist approaches are entirely mistaken and further undermine the social management of the commons in Africa. Instead, Africans should seek directly to break the chains of monopoly and oligopoly, especially over natural resources. They should also strive to use land for the common good and to systematically build social states in Africa to overcome subservience to TNCs. While previous attempts at autonomous development in Africa have sometimes led to military action by former colonizers and current neo-colonial imperialists, recent evidence from Africa suggests that such a strategy might succeed now. This article proposes to extend the politics of urban reform in the Gilded Age and Progressive Era in the United States to contemporary Africa. In doing so, it shows how African cities today are working to create local capacity by municipalizing services that have been privatized, such as distribution of water. Despite many obstacles posed by TNCs and their home governments, Africans are making great strides to overcome the enduring legacies of colonialism.","[Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Urban Econ & Property & Polit Econ, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Obeng-Odoom, F (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Urban Econ & Property & Polit Econ, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Franklin.Obeng-Odoom@uts.edu.au,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,157,15,16,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This paper exploits a distinctive feature of the Japanese judicial system, periodic judge transfers, to identify court discretion. Because judges move across local labor markets, while a single national court system ensures that there are no legal boundaries between regions, it is possible to remove any confounding relationships between current litigation outcomes and local labor markets. A key finding is that an increase in the worker victory ratio in adjustment dismissal litigations reduces the rates of both job creation and destruction. Ignoring the uncertainty inherent in court decisions would lead to misspecification of the actual cost of employment protection, especially in countries with high judicial activism.

There is an equilibrium in which the human chooses to wager that the deity exists and Pascal's Wager thus operates, but also one in which the human does not wager. Thus, in a game-theoretic setting, Pascal's Wager is indeterminate: wagering and not wagering are both consistent with equilibrium behaviour.","[Tarar, Ahmer] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Tarar, A (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ahmertarar@tamu.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

I analyze whether removing litigation risk or delitigation of product liability is associated with a change in the safety of vaccines. Using U.S. nationwide and state-level data, I find that vaccines that were licensed after legislation that preempted most product liability lawsuits are associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than were vaccines that were licensed under a previous regime that permitted consumers to sue. Oaxaca decomposition suggests that the difference is due to the policy change. The results suggest that product safety deteriorates when consumers are no longer able to sue manufacturers.","[DeLong, Gayle] CUNY, Baruch Coll, One Bernard Baruch Way,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"DeLong, G (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, One Bernard Baruch Way,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",gayle.delong@baruch.cuny.edu,,"DeLong, Gayle/0000-0003-1107-1368",Wasserman Endowment at Baruch College,Wasserman Endowment at Baruch College,Wasserman Endowment at Baruch College.,,49,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The main focus of the paper is on the effects of fiscal policy, more precisely government consumption, on employment, output, inflation and trade balance. After we analyse the model impulse responses we confront these results with the empirical results of VAR model. Our results indicate that the presented DSGE model can be a useful starting point and a toolkit in fiscal policy analysis in Croatia as estimated impulse responses from VAR model mostly match impulse responses from the calibrated model. Also, empirical results indicate that fiscal policy has a significant effect on macroeconomic developments in Croatia. Thus, it is a responsibility of fiscal policy makers to prudently use and adjust fiscal instruments in such a way that fiscal policy can always have a counter-cyclical, stabilizing effect on Croatian economy.","[Deskar-Skrbic, Milan] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Lucica 2a, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Deskar-Skrbic, Milan] Erste & Steiermark Bank, Ivana Lucica 2a, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Deskar-Skrbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Lucica 2a, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.;Deskar-Skrbic, M (通讯作者)，Erste & Steiermark Bank, Ivana Lucica 2a, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mdskrbic@erstebank.com,,,Croatian Scientific Foundation under the project Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union [IP-2016-06-4609],Croatian Scientific Foundation under the project Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union,This work was supported by Croatian Scientific Foundation under the project Public Finance Sustainability on the Path to the Monetary Union (IP-2016-06-4609).,,32,4,4,0,1,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Within tourism industry, we differentiate between supporting divisions and the main industry division (accommodation industry), and test the Law on firms in supporting divisions using modified hybrid estimator. In that way, we add to the existing field of knowledge in two ways: through analysis and quantification of intra-industry links within the Law's framework and by employing hybrid estimator originally developed by Mundlak, which is a novelty in this field of research.

The relevance of the study is also due to the fact that innovative development has set a number of primary tasks today the one of creating a high-quality and largely new system of strategic management. Without philosophical and theoretical understanding of what is management in general, as well as the identification of the subject area of aesthetics of strategic management as a holistic social phenomenon, it is impossible to understand the paradigm of modern management, how and according to which criteria one is to prepare a new generation of managers. Objective: it is a scientific and philosophical reflection of the main aspects of modeling the process of strategic management in the context of the philosophy of development as a new management paradigm, revealing the aesthetic aspects of strategic management, through the analysis of socio-cultural and historical dynamics of philosophical and aesthetic views on the management system, focused on the international and domestic practice. Methods: the article presents the theoretical and analytical method, the phenomenological method, the method of comparison and synthesis as the main research methods. Findings: the author's concept of aesthetic interpretation of strategic management is innovative. The architectonics of this work is a practice-oriented research in the field of philosophy and management. Conclusions: the practical significance of the work is its introduction into the educational process as an additional source for students' research work, preparation for tutorials, as well as for self-study.

The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer's personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers' communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents. Theoretical implications of the findings request questioning the use of the personality traits as an interim stage in decision-making predictions. In addition, these findings fill the gap in the field of communication preference based on personality traits and personality estimators.

In this literature, an important parameter is the social weight placed on population size; a standard result is that a planner with a larger weight on population chooses larger population levels and growth rates. We demonstrate that this result is conditionally overturned when an exhaustible resource constraint is introduced: if the discount rate is small enough, the optimal population today decreases with the welfare weight on population size. That is, a more total-utilitarian social planner could prefer a smaller population today than a more average-utilitarian social planner. We also present a numerical illustration applied to the case of climate change, where we show that under plausible real-world parameter values, our result matters for the direction and magnitude of optimal population policy.","[Lawson, Nicholas] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Bur DS 5819, 320 Rue Ste Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2X IL7, Canada; [Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Spears, Dean] Indian Stat Inst, Delhi Ctr, 7 SJS Sansanwal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Lawson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Bur DS 5819, 320 Rue Ste Catherine Est, Montreal, PQ H2X IL7, Canada.",lawson.nicholas@uqam.ca; dspears@utexas.edu,,,,,,,53,8,9,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

A qualitative study of the Murano glassmaking district shows that interactive learning in an industrial district occurs on both horizontal and vertical dimensions, along which proximity plays different roles. Horizontal learning takes place through social and cognitive proximity and personal distance. Vertical learning occurs through personal proximity and social and cognitive distance. This study contributes to the literature on the proximity within industrial districts by highlighting the role of personal proximity, which is largely unexplored. This paper also considers the coevolution between the proximity dimensions and provides empirical evidence of two mechanisms of coevolution: a compensation mechanism between social and cognitive proximity and a substitution mechanism between personal proximity, and cognitive and social proximities.","[Leszczynska, Dorota] IDRAC Business Sch, Nice, France; [Leszczynska, Dorota] CNRS, GREDEG, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Khachlouf, Nada] ICD Business Sch, Paris, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Leszczynska, D (通讯作者)，IDRAC Business Sch, Nice, France.",dorota.leszczynska@club-internet.fr,"Rejeb, Nada/HOF-6905-2023","Rejeb, Nada/0000-0001-8266-9100",,,,,74,16,17,5,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the authors have identified a strong association between media influence and FSE image evaluation; FSE image evaluation and residents' perceptions; residents' perceptions and attitudes; and residents' attitudes and behavioral intention. However, the study found that social interactions do not have a significant impact on FSE image evaluation. The practical application of this research is that event planners should use media to promote FSE to local residents.

Employing descriptive statistics as a tool for data analysis and presentation, this study concluded that well-designed industrial work practice was indeed a necessity for preparing vocational high school students' self-responsible and confident qualities, to survive at their future workplaces.","[Meilani, Rini Intansari; Rosmawati, Rita] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business Educ, Bandung, Indonesia",Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,"Meilani, RI (通讯作者)，Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business Educ, Bandung, Indonesia.",intanmusthafa@upi.edu,"Meilani, Rini Intansari/GMX-1749-2022","Meilani, Rini Intansari/0000-0002-4782-5726",,,,,20,0,0,1,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-723-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,65.0,,,,,,180,183,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN2FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000476673700043,0

Such territories are called brownfields and greyfields in foreign practice of urban development. They cause a number of problems in the functioning of urban spaces associated with negative environmental impact, disturbance of city-building proportions, production of hypertrophied transport streams, provoking social tensions, low economic efficiency, etc. In view of this, there is a need for the further use of brownfields and greyfields in urban economic activity with the revitalization of the surrounding urban space. The main strategies for the development of brownfields and greyfields, for today, are the conversion strategy and full refunctionalization. There are two possible ways within the framework of the conversion strategy - the reconstitution of their main functions (evolutionary conversion) and re-profiling (revolutionary conversion). Evolutionary conversion includes restoration, improvement of landscaping of the territory, reconstruction, introduction of innovative technologies, readaptation, modernization of abandoned objects, etc. Revolutionary conversion involves a shift in the specialization of abandoned objects. The strategy of full refunctionalization is carried out by refunctionalization of objects that are monuments of cultural heritage; environmental rehabilitation of the territory; the complete demolition of industrial and social objects and the use of the territory for other purposes. Specific strategies for refunctionalization are renovation, redevelopment, revitalization, remodeling of industrial and social objects, etc. For modern cities it is expedient to use combined strategies that will maximize the potential of each abandoned object. Kharkiv is the second largest city in Ukraine and the eighth in Eastern Europe by population, one of the largest industrial, scientific, educational, commercial, tourist and cultural centers of Eastern Ukraine, an important transport and logistics center of Eastern Europe.

The specific ways of revitalization of the abandoned territories of the city are offered, taking into account domestic and foreign experience, the existing social and industrial infrastructure of the city and the needs of urban residents in the services of urban infrastructure, following the main strategic goals of the development of Kharkiv, approved in the Development strategy of the city of Kharkiv by 2020.

The study therefore recommends that the requirement for substantial equity stake by directors of banking institutions be sustained.","[Okoye, Lawrence Uchenna; Olokoyo, Felicia C.; Uzohue, Rhoda C.] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria; [Okoh, Johnson I.] Natl Open Univ Nigeria, Dept Financial Studies, Lagos, Nigeria",Covenant University,"Okoye, LU (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Nigeria.",lawrence.okoye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; okohjohnson1@gmail.com; felicia.olokoyo@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; rhoda.uzohue@stu.cu.edu.ng,,"OKOH, JOHNSON/0000-0001-6611-8560","Covenant University Ota, Nigeria","Covenant University Ota, Nigeria","The authors acknowledge the support of Covenant University Ota, Nigeria towards their participation at the conference.",,28,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6484,6495,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207046,0

Foreign direct investment can perform the role of bridging this gap because it facilitates technological diffusion. However, the effect of foreign direct investment on the economic growth of developing economies may not be automatic. Some studies have found that foreign direct investment affects growth only when a certain level of absorptive capacity is reached. This study investigated this assertion in Nigeria. The objectives of the study are to examine the effect of foreign direct investment on economic growth without conditioning on absorptive capacity in Nigeria and to investigate the effect and extent of absorptive capacity on foreign direct investment and economic growth in Nigeria. The empirical study employed the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique of estimation on a time series data that span from 1980-2016. The major findings of the study revealed that foreign direct investment alone cannot promote economic growth except there is sufficient absorptive capacity. Only human capital and domestic investment have sufficient absorptive capacity to support foreign direct investment in promoting economic growth but openness, financial development and infrastructure do not have sufficient absorptive capacity to support foreign direct investment in promoting growth in Nigeria. The study, therefore, recommended that policies should be directed towards developing the levels of human capital, infrastructure, domestic investment and the domestic financial system, instead of attracting foreign direct investment through tax exemption.","[Onayemi, Sherifatu O.; Alege, Philip O.] Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria; [Olomola, Philip A.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Ife, Nigeria",Covenant University; Obafemi Awolowo University,"Onayemi, SO (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Ota, Nigeria.",koredeleonayemi@yahoo.com; polomola@yahoo.ca; philip.alege@covenantuniversity.edu.ng,"OLOMOLA, Philip/AAR-6528-2020",,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,658,669,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553201015,0

The aim of the paper is to develop a conceptual framework concerning managerial-stakeholders alignment in terms of cognition and shared mental models as well as related concepts like sense-making, attention and individual external orientation. Design/methodology approach. The aim has been realized through answering the following research questions supported with extensive literature studies: (RQ1) How to develop managerial - stakeholders alignment?, (RQ2) How might shared mental models influence attaining managerial-stakeholder alignment?, (RQ3) Which cognitive mechanisms and/or constructs might influence the process of developing shared mental models between managers and stakeholders leading to managerial-stakeholder alignment? Findings. The main implications of the paper content concern the significance of cognitive issues in reconciling managerial strategic actions and stakeholders' ones (environmental context). Contribution. While managerial and top management teams' cognition was explored and examined by scholars in terms of general issues concerning both organizational change and adaptability so as to unveil the complex intricacies inherent to strategy change, there is little research on investigating the associations between managerial cognitive frames & mental models and stakeholders' perspective. The paper contributes to enhance the state of the art in the field of organizational theory and strategic management one. Specifically, it proposes how to link cognitive issues to organization-environment adjustment from the perspective of managerial and stakeholders' shared mental models and their antecedents. Hence, the paper contributes to fill the gap and extend approaches to decision making by synthesising selected cognitive phenomena from the managerial actions stakeholders perspective. Limitations. First, the specific influence of environment high or low velocity on managerial-stakeholder alignment has not been considered. Second, a collective approach in terms of top management teams and its inner processes influencing the alignment between managers and stakeholders also have not been taken into consideration.

Based on an explorative interview study, this paper investigates how students perceive the quality of contents across these different informational platforms, and how they evaluate information quality when using user- generated content for academic (learning) purposes. The findings showed that students perceive the quality of contents rather as good, especially on Wikipedia and YouTube. In contrast, question-and-answer sites were widely seen as having a strongly mixed or poor quality. In terms of quality evaluation, students reported a comprehensive system of quality criteria embracing content-related and source-related factors as well as visual perceptions. Besides the image of a source, especially comprehensibility, accuracy, and coverage played a major role. Visual appearance was less important. However, the evaluation efforts varied strongly across the applications and among the participants. In this regard, students' assessment approaches ranged from a rather non-reflective usage of information in single cases up to more sophisticated approaches. This has important implications for universities and lecturers, as the outcome indicates that further training is required to level up and standardize students' information literacy competences.

The cold supply chain is a continuously functioning system that provides the optimum temperature for storing and transporting goods from the manufacturer to the end user, with all safety and quality requirements within the established standard shelf life. Problems in the cold supply chains are associated with the high cost of technical support and temperature control system; the absence in the legislation of requirements and regulatory documentation for the transport and storage of goods in the cold supply chain, the absence of providers of specialized services, weakly developed transport infrastructure which makes us bear large transportation costs, and multistage distribution scheme. For the cold supply chain, the critical success factors are: a mechanism that controls compliance with all the necessary temperature conditions at each stage of storage and transportation of the goods and refrigeration equipment designed to store and transport goods under optimal temperature conditions. The purpose of the study. The purpose of the article is to analyze the current state and the characteristic trends in the development of cold logistics, identify problems, significantly inhibit the development of the industry, and identify ways to solve them. Methodology. Analysis of existing data covering the available information on the characteristics of the cold logistics market. The following source documents were taken into account: reports prepared by research bodies and real estate agencies, materials, and trade information published by property owners, professional press and opinion of market analysts. In addition, the analysis of key success factors in the definition of the functioning of the cold logistics market was used as a tool for strategic analysis. Results. Based on the studies carried out in the field of cold logistics, the main indicators that stimulate the development of this area are presented. The most important indicators were identified and evaluated. Practical implications. The obtained results can be used by local authorities in the territorial development and in support of economic decisions, as well as by investors interested in the construction of cold warehouses and their leasing. Variability in time of the presented values and their dependence on various factors show the purposefulness of further research in this area. Value / originality. The market of cold logistics in Ukraine develops in accordance with world trends, significantly affects the economic potential of the country, stimulates the development of interrelated and complementary areas and is a reflection of our competitiveness. Despite the positive dynamics, the rate of development of the cold logistics market in Ukraine is lower in comparison with the global pace of development of this industry, which leads to a backlog of global processes, underutilization of potential, loss of competitive positions. This stimulates the research of the peculiarities of the domestic market of consumers of cold logistics services, the main trends and prospects.","[Saiensus, Mariia] Odessa Natl Econ Univ, Fac Int Econ, Dept Mkt, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa National Economic University,"Saiensus, M (通讯作者)，Odessa Natl Econ Univ, Fac Int Econ, Dept Mkt, Odessa, Ukraine.",,"Saiensus, Mariy/S-3688-2017",,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7222,7235,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553208019,0

Other comparative studies conducted on Romania's creative and cultural industries proved this idea to be true, and this paper will present the dimensions and performances of this sector comparing it to the whole Romanian creative economy.","[Sava, Diana; Badulescu, Alina] Univ Oradea, Doctoral Sch Econ Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Oradea, Romania; [Badulescu, Alina] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Econ & Business, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea; University of Oradea,"Sava, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Doctoral Sch Econ Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Oradea, Romania.",dianna_sava@yahoo.com; abadulescu@uoradea.ro,"Badulescu, Alina/B-6477-2015; Sava, Diana/AAB-7228-2021","Badulescu, Alina/0000-0002-0090-9340; Sava, Diana/0000-0002-9695-5228",,,,,13,0,0,1,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4171,4179,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205018,0

This position of the industry certainly requires government intervention, but what should be the level of state influence on the industry in each country is decided in its own way. In the Russian Federation, an attempt was made to define the boundaries and methods of state intervention through the creation and implementation of the federal law On the Development of Agriculture, which was aimed at strengthening the regulatory and incentive functions of the state, and the state is viewed as a monopolistic subject of a social market economy. The system of state regulation of the agrarian sector of the economy should be aimed at the implementation of the strategic course associated with the development of priority areas of agrifood policy. The article uses the economic statistical method. The empirical basis of the article is a case study of the system of state registration of the agro-industrial complex through subsidy programs.

Requirements on employees knowledge have been rising in recent years, especially with regard to the new trends and currently the widely discussed fourth industrial revolution. In the emerging network economy and knowledge society, organisations must be ready for complex knowledge dissemination and management processes. Knowledge is collected, stored, assessed, and created by an organisation and shared by its members. In the course of knowledge dissemination, members of the organisation create synergy which generates unique knowledge. Managing organisational knowledge necessary for the creation of added value and the acquisition of a competitive advantage requires evaluating the knowledge synergy and its components. The paper aims at identifying knowledge synergy components and providing an evaluation method of employees' knowledge synergy and its components to have a rational and objective evaluation of employees' knowledge, relations among employees, and organisational knowledge synergy. To achieve this aim, knowledge synergy components are identified, evaluation issues are revealed, types of knowledge synergy relations are presented together with an evaluation formula for each of these relations, components of employees' knowledge and factors reflecting knowledge content are specified, an evaluation formula for each component is provided, and an organisational knowledge synergy evaluation method is described. Due to its versatility, presented results are applicable in any industry or business area for measuring and improving intellectual capital as well as for benchmarking purposes.

The results show that cross-border e-commerce technology shocks can significantly improve China's output, but its inhibition effect on foreign output and domestic and foreign consumption is not obvious. For firms in our model, the cross-border e-commerce technology shocks has the greatest impact on the output and consumption of cross-border e-commerce goods, followed by the output and consumption of non-cross-border e commerce goods, and the least impact on the output and consumption of non-traded goods.

The analysis of the theory and practice of formation of strategies ofsocial and economic systems, carried out mainly in relation to the systems of regional and municipal levels, showed that the formation of the tree (pyramid) of goals is largely related to the views of experts on their subordination and compliance. The formation of a pyramid of goals is inevitable due to unawareness of the mission and, consequently, the uncertain position of the system in the future. This circumstance might bring about even more uncertainty in the future. In practice, the formulation of goals at various levels, beginning with the general objectiveand finishing with the functional goals of various subsystems, does not have a strong casual effect. There can be different hierarchical goals at one level. And vice versa, at different levels there can be goals having the same characteristics but belonging to different functional subsystems.

However, the literature reveals no systematic analysis of the possible social welfare losses due to the cost of both quantity depletion and quality deterioration. This paper therefore investigates the long run welfare cost of using groundwater for agriculture by including both quantity depletion and quality deterioration costs simultaneously. This is achieved through an empirical study of onion farmers in Sri Lanka who use groundwater for their cultivation. A significant social welfare loss is found in terms of both groundwater quantity and quality deterioration costs and which is likely to increase over the long run.

We find that the conventional anchors of mobility are less powerful for immigrants living in co-ethnic regions. Results also show that under depressed economic conditions, migration decisions are largely driven by economic factors, and that socio-demographic factors like marital status are less consequential.

We investigate the causal effect of the weakness of contract enforcement on average firm size across Italian municipalities, exploiting spatial discontinuities in court jurisdictions for identification. Italy provides an ideal environment for this exercise, as it displays wide variation in judicial efficiency across courts, while the allocation of municipalities to jurisdictions is a historical legacy and does not overlap with other political or economic discontinuities. Our estimates indicate that reducing the length of judicial proceedings (i.e. improving contract enforceability) by 10% at court level leads to a 2% increase in average size of local firms. The outcome on turnover growth is of the same magnitude, suggesting that the effect operates at the intensive margin.","[Giacomelli, Silvia] Bank Italy, Via Nazl 191, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Menon, Carlo] OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Menon, Carlo] LSE, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Menon, C (通讯作者)，OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.;Menon, C (通讯作者)，LSE, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",carlo.menon@oecd.org,"Menon, Carlo/AAL-3158-2020","Menon, Carlo/0000-0003-0678-0434",,,,,38,21,22,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We estimate the marginal external cruising costs of parking-that is, the time costs that an additional parked car imposes on drivers by inducing them to cruise for parking-which is one of the main components of cruising-for-parking externalities. The level of cruising is identified by examining to what extent the car inflow rate into a parking location falls with parking occupancy level. For a commercial street in Istanbul, we demonstrate that a marginal car parking for an hour induces 3.6 other cars to cruise for parking. This translates into an external cruising cost that is in the same order of magnitude with the external traffic congestion cost created by the trip.","[Inci, Eren] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey; [van Ommeren, Jos] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, FEWEB, De Boelelaan, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kobus, Martijn] MuConsult, Utrechtseweg 24, NL-3811 NB Amersfoort, Netherlands",Sabanci University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Inci, E (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",ereninci@sabanciuniv.edu,"Inci, Eren/B-6010-2012","Inci, Eren/0000-0001-8990-9672; Van Ommeren, Jos/0000-0003-4838-478X","Turkish Academy of Sciences (Outstanding Young Scientist Award, TUBA-GEBIP); Science Academy (Turkey) via its Young Scientist Award (BAGEP)","Turkish Academy of Sciences (Outstanding Young Scientist Award, TUBA-GEBIP)(Turkish Academy of Sciences); Science Academy (Turkey) via its Young Scientist Award (BAGEP)","This article is screened by ISPARK to ensure that no confidential information is revealed.

Proponents of SIBs argue that they present a solution to several problems in funding social services, including performance incentives and risk allocation. Using a simple model, we first demonstrate that, despite their apparent novelty, SIBs in concept need not produce any difference in outcome from standard financing arrangements with private nonprofit firms. We then argue that SIBs will lead to greater program success if investors' effort responds to incentives and can positively influence outcomes, either directly (e.g., effort exerted in production) or indirectly (e.g., effort devoted to screening), but are unlikely to do so otherwise. We conclude that, as in the more general theoretical literature, the value of this particular application in terms of funding innovation will be strongly context-dependent.","[Pauly, Mark V.; Swanson, Ashley] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Pauly, Mark V.; Swanson, Ashley] NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Pauly, MV (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Pauly, MV (通讯作者)，NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,101,16,17,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Irrespective of the higher returns on pension contribution and varied pension reforms, there are possible factors that can render these pension benefits inadequate, which can affect the longevity of retirees. Studies conducted in other countries have concluded that inflation deteriorates the value of pension benefits. Aim: This study, thus, sought to assess the impact of some major economic indicators in the Ghanaian environment on pension benefits. Setting: This study was carried out in Ghana by obtaining quarterly data frequencies on pension benefits and economic indicators spanning the period 2000Q1 to 2014Q4. Method: The Auto-regressive Distributed Lag Model was utilised to examine the long run and short run dynamics of some major economic indicators and pension benefits. Results: The empirical evidence indicated that inflation deteriorates total pension benefits. Increasing monetary policy rate and depreciation of the domestic currency should be an issue to contend with only in the short run rather than in the long run. The study also found the prominence of the implementation of the National Pension Reform in 2008. Conclusion: The study concluded that if policy makers target the reduction in the monetary policy rate and the appreciation of the domestic currency in an effort to stabilise the value of total pension benefits in the long run, it would not be effective in the long run because of their insignificant nature. Policy makers should rather target inflation as the prime tool for stabilising the standard of living of retirees in the long run.","[Ofori-Abebrese, Grace; Abubakari, Sherifatu] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kumasi, Ghana; [Pickson, Robert Becker] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yaan, Peoples R China",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Pickson, RB (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yaan, Peoples R China.",myselfpickson@yahoo.com,"PICKSON, ROBERT BECKER/ABC-8549-2020","PICKSON, ROBERT BECKER/0000-0003-4084-3427",,,,,15,1,2,0,6,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This method is well suited when regions differ greatly in population size, as is the case in Sweden. The maximum likelihood estimates are substantially more precise than those obtained by running separate OLS regressions. I find that few regions are statistically significantly different from the Swedish average when measuring mobility in relative terms, while a greater number of regional differences emerge when focusing on absolute outcomes.

Rather than first model the various features of the conditional return distribution and subsequently characterize the portfolio choice, we focus directly on the dependence of the portfolio weights on the predictor variables through a linear parametric portfolio policy rule. This characterization allows us to apply GMM estimation and testing methods to sample analogues of the multiperiod Euler equations that characterize our optimal portfolio choice. Our model accommodates an arbitrarily large number of assets in the portfolio and state variables in the information set. The empirical results for a portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash provide ample support to the linear specification of the portfolio weights and reveal significant differences between myopic (one-period) and strategic (long-term) optimal portfolio allocations.

Our analysis suggests that a joint effect of institutional rules, governance structures, and shared cognition plays a pivotal role in firm-level competitive behavior and capability development.

This has motivated the promotion of employer-based return to work programs, despite a lack of systematic evidence on the effectiveness of such programs. We combine data on duration of time out of work for workers' compensation claimants with information on employer return to work programs to estimate the impact of the programs on time out of work. Discrete-time hazard estimates suggest that the workers in a program return approximately 1.4 times sooner compared to workers injured at a firm without a program. The biggest reductions in work-injury absence are experienced by men, likely due to occupational differences, and by workers with a permanent disability. Modifying work equipment is associated with the greatest reductions in injury durations relative to other program components. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that these programs are cost-effective for large, self-insured employers. More work is needed to determine whether these programs could be adopted successfully by smaller firms.

Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) structures are included in the error terms of the models when evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity is found. Model selection is based on various out-of-sample criteria. Results show that decomposition of realized volatility is important for forecasting and that the decision whether to include GARCH-type innovations might depend on the transformation selected.

In this paper, we study these competitors' incentives to acquire and to disclose information on the quality of their rivals' products and question when we can leave the information disclosure process to the competitive pressure of markets and when there is a need for governmentale intervention. We find that low quality levels can be disclosed in markets that exhibit negative spill-over effects, but should not be expected to be disclosed in markets that exhibit a Positive spill-over effect.

In our model average, we entertain different channels of instability by either incorporating breaks in the regression coefficients of each individual model within our model average, breaks in the conditional error variance, or both. Changes in these parameters are driven by mixture distributions for state innovations (MIA) of linear Gaussian state-space models. This framework allows us to compare models that assume small and frequent as well as models that assume large but rare changes in the conditional mean and variance parameters. Results using S&P 500 monthly and quarterly realized volatility data from 1960 to 2014 suggest that Bayesian model averaging in combination with breaks in the regression coefficients and the error variance through MIA dynamics generates statistically significantly more accurate forecasts than the benchmark autoregressive model. However, compared to a MIA autoregression with breaks in the regression coefficients and the error variance, we fail to provide any drastic improvements.","[Nonejad, Nima] Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark; [Nonejad, Nima] Aalborg Univ, CREATES, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University; Aalborg University; CREATES,"Nonejad, N (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",nimanonejad@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,1,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

We examine the relationship between knowledge search and product innovation in both low and high-tech industry with a survey data from China. While both internal and external knowledge search are conducive to product innovation of high-tech firms, only external knowledge search is valuable for low-tech firms. External unrelated knowledge is significant for innovation of high-tech firms whereas external related knowledge search is significantly enough for low-tech firms. It highlights the importance of knowledge relatedness in innovation and appeals a shift of theoretical focus from how to search' and where to search' to what to search' in the process of innovation.","[Wu, Aiqi] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Cassandra C.] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Wang, CC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wuaiqi@zju.edu.cn; chencwang@zju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471101, 71572174, 41101112]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41471101, 71572174, 41101112).",,62,5,5,8,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In the present paper, the hypothesis of careerism affecting judges' conduct is investigated with regard to the case of the Italian Constitutional Court, where judges only serve for a limited and non-renewable term of 9 years. This institutional framework allows to reasonably assume on a theoretical level the existence of career concerns among them. In order to maximize the chances of future appointments, judges try to earn as much reputation as possible among relevant audiences. Empirical evidence supports the theory that career concerns push judges to react to incentives that alter the reputational returns of their conduct.

Consequently, forecasts of unknown benchmarks are obtained. The regression method of benchmarking may lead to better results than widely used numerical methods, but the model for the error of the more frequent data is supposed to be known. By properly choosing a first-order autoregressive model as 'working model' for the error, the regression method may work well in reality.

This case study on the Amsterdam-based Homomonument attends to this gap by differentiating emotions according to multi-scalar, multi-temporal and multi-semiotic dimensions of everyday lived experiences of sexual citizenship. Based on discourse analysis of secondary materials and social media coverage, supplemented with auto-ethnographic experience, the study explores how present-day feelings of respect, agitation and celebration around Homomonument are mediated at intersecting levels of the body, local community, broader society and especially emergent virtual community spaces. Such understanding requires critical interfaces with reminiscences, contemporary values and normativities, and future imaginaries. Specifically, this paper puts in perspective how Homomonument operates as queer micropublic: a space for intercultural encounter and queerying' sexual difference. This appears to be a multifaceted meaningful process, too: Homomonument ambiguously holds contesting, reconciling, indifferent and empathic sentiments alongside belongings and sexual identity expressions in quotidian life.","[Zebracki, Martin] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Zebracki, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",M.M.Zebracki@leeds.ac.uk,,"Zebracki, Martin/0000-0003-0053-2093",,,,,39,11,14,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In lieu of direct empirical evidence on corporate control at the global level, the most widespread assumption is that the globalization of ownership has taken the form of an expansion of arm's-length, market-based arrangements traditionally prevailing in the Anglo-American economies. Here, however, we challenge this assumption, both empirically and conceptually. Empirically, we show that three-quarters of the world's 205 largest firms by sales are linked to a single global company network of concentrated (5 percent) ownership ties. This network has a hierarchically centralized organization, with a dominant global network core of US fund managers ringed by a more geographically diverse state capitalist periphery. Conceptually, we argue that the this architecture can be broadly explained through a Polanyian variegated capitalist model of contradictory market institutionalization, with the formation of the global company network actually a counterintuitive product of global financial marketization. In order to understand this process of network formation, however, it is necessary to extend Polanyi's model of a double movement, mediated through political interventions in the market, to incorporate Veblenian processes of evolutionary institutional change, mediated through the market.","[Haberly, Daniel] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, St Peters Coll, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Haberly, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",d.haberly@sussex.ac.uk,,"Wojcik, Dariusz/0000-0003-2158-284X",Leverhulme Trust [RGS-359]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [T31-717/12/R],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"Earlier versions of this article were presented by Daniel Haberly under the same title for the Human Geography Speaker series in the Department of Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol, on October 20, 2015, the RGS-IBG Annual International Conference in London, on September 1, 2016, and the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies External Seminar Series at Newcastle University, on October 6, 2016.

Despite the considerable attention awarded to this theme, the role and quality of mission statements in the strategic management of tourism firms has not been sufficiently highlighted. The present paper aims therefore at bridging this literature gap, by assessing the quality of cruise line mission statements, considering that, to the best of our knowledge, a relevant systematic study does not exist yet. We employ three measures of quality derived from previous literature: (1) inclusion of stakeholder groups; (2) mention of specific mission components (Target/Customers/Segments; Products; Location; Technology; Concern For Survival; Philosophy; Self Concept; Concern For Public Image; Concern For Employees); (3) reference to the four goals assigned to mission statements: disclosure of the sense of future direction, definition of control mechanism, decision making guide, and a motivation tool for employees. We apply the content analysis methods to analyze the mission statements of 44 cruise lines operating in the Standard/Ocean and Luxury/Niche market segments. The results suggest that the statements fall short of meeting the quality criteria suggested by the academic literature. Variations from the ideal and high quality missions are discussed. Limited differences also emerge between firms belonging to the two cruise market segments. This contribution presents some valuable research implications, useful for researchers and academics, but also professionals and investors may benefit from this knowledge.","[Penco, Lara; Profumo, Giorgia; Scarsi, Roberta] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Business Studies, Strateg Management & Corp Strategy, Via Francesco Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Profumo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Business Studies, Strateg Management & Corp Strategy, Via Francesco Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",lara.penco@economia.unige.it; giorgia.profumo@economia.unige.it; roberta.scarsi@economia.unige.it,"Profumo, Giorgia/J-7950-2019","Profumo, Giorgia/0000-0001-7110-9204; PENCO, LARA/0000-0001-7208-1936",,,,,46,5,5,0,25,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

In 1983, Colorado delicensed funeral services. Using difference-in-differences, difference-in-difference-in-differences, and synthetic control specifications, we compare wages in Colorado's funeral services industry to wages in the US funeral services industry. Overall, the results from difference-in-differences, difference-in-difference-in-differences, and synthetic control specifications suggest occupational licensing causes a wage premium of 11-12%. We find similar results from a standard cross-sectional wage regression using data on individuals in 1990. Thus, this suggests that cross-sectional regressions of wages on occupational licensing in other industries are a good baseline estimate of a causal effect. We also find that licensing increases prices and appears to push consumers away from cremation and towards more expensive burial procedures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the growing concern is how the concessionaires will recoup their money at operation phase in BOT road projects, due to the traffic revenue risk that is highly unpredictable, particularly in developing countries. Yet effort at investigating traffic revenue risk factors in BOT road projects through an empirical method in developing countries received scant attention. It is against this backdrop that this study identified and critically assessed the traffic revenue risk factors in BOT road projects in Nigeria. This study further identified and assessed the mitigation strategies to traffic revenue risk in BOT road projects. In achieving this, the study adopted three different data gathering phases to include literature review, a preliminary survey, and questionnaire survey. The questionnaires were administered to three different primary stakeholder groups comprised public sector authorities (i.e. ministries, department, agencies), concessionaires, and lenders/banks involved from conception to operation phase of BOT transport projects in Nigeria. Data collected were analysed using mean score, Kruskal-Wallis test, and factor analysis. The study, through factor analysis, grouped the 25 identified traffic revenue risk factors into 3 principal factors. Similarly, the factor analysis classified the 19 identified mitigation strategies into 4 key factors. It is believed that this study will benefit the policymakers and other stakeholders to draw policy recommendations that will positively influence the development of BOT road projects in Nigeria and developing countries at large.","[Babatunde, Solomon Olusola] Obafemi Awolowo Univ Ile Ife, Dept Quant Surveying, Ife, Nigeria; [Perera, Srinath] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Kingswood Campus, Parramatta, NSW, Australia",Obafemi Awolowo University; Western Sydney University,"Babatunde, SO (通讯作者)，Obafemi Awolowo Univ Ile Ife, Dept Quant Surveying, Ife, Nigeria.",sobabatunde80@gmail.com; srinath.perera@westernsydney.edu.au,"Perera, Srinath/H-8575-2014","Perera, Srinath/0000-0001-9218-9282",,,,,47,27,27,4,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

For most of the past two centuries, African Americans were forced to attend segregated colleges and universities. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) played a particularly important role during that long period. In many states, there would have been no institutions of higher education at all, were it not for federal legislation (the Morrill Act of 1890), the actions of religious institutions, and the persistent efforts of black Americans to gain an education, despite the obstacles. Even the seemingly race-neutral G.I. Bill of 1944 had the pernicious effect of reinforcing racial segregation in both higher education and housing. Given this history, it comes as no surprise that some predominantly white institutions of higher education (PWIs) do not show a sustained commitment to educate African-American students in this country, although they are often eager to recruit black student athletes for their various sport programs without much regard to the education received by those same athletes. Our inability as a nation to even talk intelligently about these intractable educational problems is disturbing. Indeed, diversity is not paramount for some PWIs, particularly in regards to hiring minority faculty. Perhaps more significantly, HBCUs are still necessary in our society today because they have been the mainstay of educating African Americans at the college and university levels. Black communities throughout our nation are still being devastated by economic polarization and by racial discrimination endemic to higher education at white institutions. The need to address the problem of racial discrimination in higher education remains as strong as ever.","[Bracey, Earnest N.] Coll Southern Nevada, Polit Sci & African Amer Hist, Las Vegas, NV 89146 USA",,"Bracey, EN (通讯作者)，Coll Southern Nevada, Polit Sci & African Amer Hist, Las Vegas, NV 89146 USA.",,,,,,,,41,21,120,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Planning for TOD around existing transit nodes can only be effective if the assessment of the base situation is done properly. To do so, we propose a methodology to quantitatively measure existing levels of TOD in terms of a TOD Index, within walkable distance of a transit node, by measuring various criteria that define TOD. The value of a TOD index indicates the level to which TOD supporting characteristics are inplace around a transit node and what may be required to be improved so as to attain better transit orientation of thedevelopment. With these results in hand, TOD planning proposals can become more accurate by targeting investments on the most relevant or critical factors. The methodology was applied to the city region of Arnhem and Nijmegen, The Netherlands. A TOD index was calculated for areas around the 21 train stations in the region. The results help in drawing TOD policy for the region by identifying which station areas need more attention than others and at the same time, for each station, identifying specific TOD characteristic(s) that need improvement.","[Singh, Yamini Jain; Lukman, Azhari; Flacke, Johannes; Van Maarseveen, M.

Applying this measure, we find that about 80% of developable land that was more accessible to the urban center than newly built subdivisions remained undeveloped as of 1960. This amount declined by more than 50% over our 45-year study period to 36% in 2005. We compare this pattern with a hypothesized pattern generated by a parameterized intertemporal urban growth model and find that the observed pattern is consistent with urban economic theory, including the implied effects of zoning. Specifically, by fixing the allowable development density, low-density zoning eliminates the incentive to withhold more accessible land and thus reduces leapfrog development, a prediction that we confirm empirically. The results illustrate the efficacy of the urban growth model and the substantial influence of spatially heterogeneous zoning on urban land development patterns.","[Zhang, Wendong] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Wrenn, Douglas H.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [Irwin, Elena G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Iowa State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Zhang, WD (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",wdzhang@iastate.edu,"Zhang, Wendong/M-9152-2015","Zhang, Wendong/0000-0002-1244-3357; Irwin, Elena/0000-0001-7908-5964","National Science Foundation [WSC 1058059, DEB 0410336, GSS 1127044]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1027188] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from National Science Foundation Grants WSC 1058059, DEB 0410336, GSS 1127044.",,37,17,17,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In the most rural parts of the region distances to schools and shops will exceed walking and biking distances. Distances to work will increase on average. With the bicycle and e-bicycle fewer jobs will be accessible, although the e bicycle shows greater reach than public transport. Despite the population and job decline, more jobs will be accessible by car, as a result of current investments in road infrastructure. This is enhanced by the ongoing development of economic centers along the highways, resulting in a growing mismatch between the rail system and the spatial economic structure of the region. We developed policy scenarios to explore spatial conditions for reducing car-dependence within the region. Intensifying land uses along the axes of public transport has a limited effect in a shrinking region. Introducing direct and fast public transport connections to the existing economic centers however does have effect. We tested two transport policy scenarios, one based on improving Inter City (IC) rail services on the existing rail network and one based on creating Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services on the existing highways. The IC-scenario makes more jobs accessible outside the current daily urban system, while the BRT-scenario intensifies relations within the region. With regards to CD 'three worlds' seem to be emerging in this medium-sized, 'post growth' region. Rural areas (10-15% of the population in 2030) are increasingly becoming completely car dependent, suburban areas (65 -75% of the population) are offering travel choices to daily amenities, but increasingly becoming more car dependent in relation to jobs, and central urban areas (15-20% of the population) are providing travel choices to amenities as well as jobs, but only under the condition of improving the regional public transport system.","[Wiersma, J.] Univ Amsterdam, Municipal Maastricht, Plenkershoven 41, NL-6212GL Maastricht, Netherlands; [Bertolini, L.] Univ Amsterdam, UvA,Postbus 15804, NL-1001 NH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Straatemeier, T.] Univ Amsterdam, Goudappel Coffeng BV, Rugterkade 143, NL-1011 AC Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Wiersma, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Municipal Maastricht, Plenkershoven 41, NL-6212GL Maastricht, Netherlands.",Jake.wiersma@maastricht.nl; L.Bertolini@uva.nl; TStraatemeier@goudappel.nl,,", Luca/0000-0002-4476-0648",,,,,41,10,10,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

To construct support ratios, we use National Transfer Accounts (NTA) estimates of per capita labor income and consumption by age, as well as population estimates and projections provided by the UN Population Division for 16 African countries. First, we find that, on average, support ratios are rising in Africa. But compared with the support ratios in Asia and Latin America, the magnitude of those in Africa is lower because the percentage of effective workers in the total population is also low. Second, we find that human capital spending is high in countries with low fertility rates, which suggests a quantity-quality trade-off. NTA estimates also show that to capitalize on the demographic dividend, countries have to create economic opportunities for young adults. In addition, investment in human and physical capital is important to generate the second demographic dividend.","[Dramani, Latif] CREFAT Univ Thies, BP 988, Thies, Senegal; [Oga, Idossou Jean-Baptiste] LAREG Univ Parakou, Parakou, Benin",,"Dramani, L (通讯作者)，CREFAT Univ Thies, BP 988, Thies, Senegal.",latif.dramani@gmail.com,,"Dramani, Latif/0000-0001-6178-875X",,,,,12,1,1,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Our results show that, depending on the tax level, between 4.5 and 19 Million tons of CO2 might be saved each year. We provide insight into how carbon pricing affects substitution of high- by low-carbon fuels at the province level. In fact, as historically substitution of gasoline by diesel was driven by a price differential, today taxing carbon makes it considerably more attractive for consumers to shift to low-carbon fuels like LPG and natural gas.

In the experiment, the agreement of many agents (called landowners) to transfer their property rights to a single agent (called the developer) generates an economic surplus. In this setting, we show that a very primitive legal technology sequential cash purchase (SC-P) is a strong implementation of a unique efficient bargaining outcome as a subgame perfect equilibrium. However, when deployed in the laboratory, SC-P results in an average loss of 60% of the economic surplus through inefficient negotiation failure. Deploying a more behaviorally robust but also more legally complex technology, a tender and conditional offer (TC-O) mechanism, halved the surplus loss and supported significant developer payoffs. These results suggest that, even absent asymmetric information, moral hazard, and transactions costs, complex legal technologies can increase bargaining efficiency.","[Goswami, Gautam] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Noe, Thomas] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Balliol Coll, Oxford, England; [Wang, Jun] CUNY, New York, NY 10021 USA",Fordham University; University of Oxford; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Noe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Balliol Coll, Oxford, England.",thomas.noe@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"Noe, Thomas/ABB-8061-2021; Molina, Allison/ABH-2269-2021","Noe, Thomas/0000-0003-4068-1202;",Graduate School of Business of Fordham University,Graduate School of Business of Fordham University,Goswami would like to thank Graduate School of Business of Fordham University for providing the experimental laboratory and financial support for running the experiments.

To better understand how consumer concerns vary by type of personal data, the authors created a typology of information types based on perceived associated risks. In a national consumer survey, 52 information types were analyzed along four perceived risk categories (physical, psychological, monetary, and social), consumers' overall sensitivity regarding the information, and their willingness to provide it. This resulted in six highly distinctive clustersBasic Demographics, Personal Preferences, Contact Information, Community Interaction, Financial Information, and Secure Identifiersorganized around similarities in perceived risk profile. Additionally, consumer segmentation analysis shows rank order of cluster risk perceptions to be stable, even when perceived magnitude and overall risk propensities change by segment. This research advances the conversation from an outdated PII/non-PII framework to a more meaningful, consumer-based understanding of the perceived risks associated with different types of personal information.","[Milne, George R.; Pettinico, George; Hajjat, Fatima M.] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Markos, Ereni] Suffolk Univ, Boston, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Suffolk University,"Milne, GR (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",milne@isenberg.umass.edu; gpettinico@som.umass.edu; fhajjat@som.umass.edu; emarkos@suffolk.edu,"Milne, George R./M-3210-2019",,,,,,70,71,79,11,89,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

The outcome of a European survey,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial supervisory liability; Tort law; Deterrence; Empirical research; Defensive conduct,,"One of the arguments frequently used to limit the liability of financial supervisory authorities is the idea that normal liability rules result in defensive conduct and, therefore, in ineffective financial supervision. The impact of tort law on financial supervisory authorities is, however, highly debated, and no overwhelming empirical evidence exists to support it. This article presents findings from an empirical study on financial supervisors in the member states of the European Union. Targeting senior financial supervisors, the survey presented a series of statements, asking respondents to state their opinions about the impact of financial supervisory liability. In summary, most of the respondents seem to classify the impact of financial supervisory liability as neutral or positive. At most, the evidence from the survey implies an arguably modest degree of deterrence. Because the survey found no significant differences between respondents who perceive the liability of their organization as limited and those who do not, it suggests that limiting financial supervisory liability does not have an impact on the behavior, or at least on the perceptions of the impact of financial supervisory liability, of financial supervisors. Therefore, the study calls into question the widely accepted argument of defensive conduct as a reason for limiting the liability of financial supervisory authorities.","[Dijkstra, Robert J.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Private Law, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Dijkstra, RJ (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Private Law, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",dijkstra_rj@hotmail.com,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Training fosters labour productivity, boosts competitiveness, and strengthens firms' capacity to innovate. This key role of training, however, raises relevant issues in terms of the optimal level of the corresponding investment. In fact firms that bear training costs may not be able to fully appropriate the relevant benefits. In addition training may facilitate structural changes and stimulate growth nationwide. Efficiency reasons thus justify the existence of legal and/or institutional tools, either voluntary or mandatory, aimed at addressing suboptimal investments in human capital development. The purpose of this study is to draw a systematic taxonomy of the main legal and institutional devices able to address the underlying inefficiencies of training investments. Training is on the top of the political agenda in many countries. The European Union is committed to increase adults' participation in lifelong learning and to improve the quality of training programs and institutions. However, while training is of increasing political interest, a proper tool-box for policy makers is still missing.","[Pedrini, Giulio] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Pedrini, Giulio] SDIC, Bologna, Italy; [Pedrini, Giulio] CRISP Interuniv Res Ctr Publ Serv, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Pedrini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",giulio.pedrini3@unibo.it,"Pedrini, Giulio/AAW-6152-2021","pedrini, giulio/0000-0002-4972-171X",,,,,94,4,8,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

A medical savings account (MSA) represents a financing mechanism which relies on the accumulation of personal savings to cover the costs of health care services at the time of consumption. With the use of actuarial methods an attempt was made to estimate the amount of the MSA contribution based on the discounted value of a person's health care expenses, age, gender, and investment variants. In the analysis, statistical data from representative household budget surveys conducted by the Central Statistical Office of Poland was used. The obtained results confirm that a medical savings account can be used to finance personal out-of-pocket health care expenses; however it requires systematic and long-term saving for health purposes. Age and gender of an MSA holder have the greatest impact on the amount of contribution, as these factors determine mortality rates and the length of the discounting period. From the individual's perspective, MSA application requires this financing instrument to be taken into account in decisions related to the intertemporal choice between consumption and saving.","[Borda, Marta] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Insurance, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Borda, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Insurance, Wroclaw, Poland.",bordamarta@wp.pl,"Borda, Marta/T-9537-2018",,National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00563],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",This paper is financed from the funds of the National Science Centre in Poland granted under decision no.

Specifically, Cornes and Silva's (J Polit Econ 107(5):1034-1040, 1999) result of efficiency in the contribution game amongst siblings extends to a setting where the contributors (spouses) belong to different families. More strikingly still, the mechanism may also have dramatic redistributive implications. In particular, we show that the rotten kids mechanism combined with a contribution game to a household public good may lead to an astonishing equalization of consumptions between and within families, even when their parents' wealth levels differ. The most striking results obtain when wages are equal and when parents' initial wealth levels are not too different. For very large wealth differences, the mechanism must be supplemented by a (mandatory) transfer that brings them back into the relevant range. When wages differ but are similar, the outcome will be near efficient (and near egalitarian).","[Cremer, Helmuth] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France; [Roeder, Kerstin] Univ Augsburg, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Augsburg,"Cremer, H (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse, France.",helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu; kerstin.roeder@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR,Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR,"Financial support from the Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR is gratefully acknowledged.

While there is an extensive literature in this field in the OECD countries, the number of studies in the developing countries is quite inadequate. Although in Turkey there are some studies in this subject, theoretical and empirical studies are insufficient. There is a positive relationship between health expenditure and particularly GDP as one of the factors which have an influence on health expenditure increase. GDP is an important exogenous variable which affects health expenditure. In empirical studies on the relationship between GDP level and health expenditure, the existence of a generally unidirectional relationship from GDP to health expenditure has been determined. However in some studies, there are findings suggesting a relationship of causality between the two variables. It has been observed that in Turkey there have been a rapid increase in health expenditure in the recent years and that the share of government expenditure on health in total expenditure on health has increased substantially. In this study parametric Pearson test and nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test have been conducted in order to determine the relationship between government expenditure on health and GDP.

Tourism managers struggle daily to stay ahead in the competition to attract more tourists to destinations. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the past could shed light on the advantages of the future. Aim: The aim of this study was to do a temporal analysis of the competitiveness of South Africa as a tourism destination. Setting: This research investigated the competitive position of South Africa as a tourism destination just after the 1994 elections and compared those results to the results of a similar study in 2014. Methods: In this article, a frequency analysis revealed South Africa's strengths and weaknesses, after which t-tests indicated the relationship between the strengths and weaknesses of the destination and the factors that contribute to South Africa's competitiveness. Results: South Africa's strengths include the quality of the food and experience, scenery, variety of accommodation climate and geographical features. It is clear that respondents identified different attributes that contributed to the strengths of the destination in comparison with 2002, where the strengths were wildlife, scenery, cultural diversity, climate, value for money, variety of attractions and specific icons. Conclusion: This research is valuable for South Africa because it informs tourism role players about what respondents perceive to be South Africa's strengths. Role players can then form strategies that incorporate the strengths to create competitive advantage. This article also indicates the areas in which the country has grown in the past decade as well as indicating which weaknesses remain a problem.","[du Plessis, Engelina; Saayman, Melville; van der Merwe, Annari] North West Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Tourism Res Econ Environs & Soc, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"du Plessis, E (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Tourism Management, Tourism Res Econ Environs & Soc, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",lindie.duplessis@nwu.ac.za,"Du Plessis, Engelina/B-2305-2018","Du Plessis, Engelina/0000-0001-9314-9127; saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140",National Research Foundation,National Research Foundation,We would like to thank the National Research Foundation for the funding of this master study.,,45,8,10,2,15,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

While it is important to manage all the processes of supply chains, transportation is the most important but also the most expensive process within the chain in the European Union. The fundamental advantage is that it can be combined with other forms of transportation that without it were fully ineffective. Therefore, depending on the activity and size of company, it is very important to manage the organization of transport in order to achieve significant savings in this segment. Europe has, after World War II, given great importance to road transport that has become the main link between buyers and suppliers.

The value judgment, as it coordinates evidences, inferences and decisions, deals with epistemological, logical and ethical matters; therefore it connects knowledge with responsibility-personal and social-upon the allocation of the real rights and the transformation of the city and the territory which depend on the result of the evaluation. The value judgment mainly connects a factual realm with a value realm. The connection between these two spheres bases on argumentations concerning: the description of the characteristics of the economic goods involved, the definition of a causal relationship between these characteristics and their market appreciation, expressed by price; the placement of the good inside this relationship according to the described characteristics. This contribution discusses the elements of truth of this model, that in certain cases is very weak in epistemological and in logical terms as well, trying to stress the difference between science of the valuations and estimation, therefore between a science of the interpretation of the values and a technique of simple observation and elicitations of occurrences by means of statistics procedures independent from the observer. In this sense it tries to compare some aspects of the theory of truth to the main elements of the theory of value we generally apply, but not always with full awareness. The contribution constitutes the initial part of a more extensive research. It analyzes some aspects of the relation between truth and value and highlights, on the grounds of the articulations of the problem of the trueness and the nature of the evaluative statement, some relevant operative issues of the discipline.","[Giuffrida, Salvatore] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via S Sofia 64, I-95123 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Giuffrida, S (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Via S Sofia 64, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",sgiuffrida@dica.unict.it,"Giuffrida, Salvatore/A-8579-2015","Giuffrida, Salvatore/0000-0001-6652-6441",,,,,19,16,16,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_1,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600001,0

However, in some sectors involved in project-type manufacturing, the same decision-making criteria cannot be applied and, plus, there is no point in determining the quantity of orders. For instance, in wind power plant projects, a single turbine supplier needs to be selected for each project. This study proposes an integrated FANP-f-MIGP model that ensures the selection of the optimal supplier for each project by applying the model to an energy firm. The criteria specific to the selection of wind power plant turbine suppliers are established, and the criteria weights are obtained by fuzzy analytic network process (FANP). As a result of the analysis, the most important criterion of all is cost. These weights constitute the coefficients of the f-MIGP model's objective function. Under the defined constraints, by minimizing cost and risk and maximizing quality and services of the firm, the selection of an optimal wind turbine supplier from three suppliers for each of three projects is ensured. This study contributes to the literature both by the specific criteria it establishes and its proposed integrated model which allows for the selection of the best supplier in wind turbine and similar project-based productions.","[Kaya Samut, Pinar] Atilim Univ, Dept Management, Fac Management, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey",Atilim University,"Kaya Samut, P (通讯作者)，Atilim Univ, Dept Management, Fac Management, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey.",pinar.samut@atilim.edu.tr,"kaya samut, Pınar/I-6443-2018",,,,,,70,5,5,0,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The placement of blocks and their replicas has a marked impact on the data reliability and system performance. Various replica placement policies have been proposed in the past decades, and some of them have been implemented in enterprise storage systems. However, it is difficult to verify that a selected placement scheme yield near-optimal performance or reliability in the real world due to several reasons. First, it is not feasible to build up a physical testbed with hundreds of storage nodes; and constructing a simulation model is also costly and hard to catch up with the fast-paced changes in industry. Second, previous studies usually carry out the analysis to address only one particular facet of schemes. Third, most algorithms are too complicated for programmers to adopt. Hence a synthetic and cost efficient method is needed. Here we use an analytic model to assess reliability and performance of replica placement policies by using a combination of quantitative metrics. We claim that this method is useful for both the analysis in the stage of architecture design and the parameter selection of existing systems.

It is also considered to be an important tool of corporate responsibility in economic areas. Of all the progressive actions that the EU and Member States have implemented to revive the European economy, the issue of women's participation in the labor market, particularly in corporate governance, merits more attention. Equality between women and men is one of the European Union's founding values yet clearly there are significant differences in pay by gender and representation of women on boards. One of the principles of corporate governance, the responsibilities of the board, is closely related to the issue of gender equality. According to this principle the board should ensure the strategic management of the company, the effective monitoring of management and should act responsibly towards both society and shareholders. These activities may be determined by many factors and one of them is gender equality. Advancing gender equality in the labor market continues to be a policy objective in many European Union countries. Wide national variations are evident in strategies and accomplishments towards improving gender equality at all levels of the labor market, including corporate governance roles. This paper focuses on the effect of gender diversity on corporate governance in companies listed on the Bratislava Stock Exchange. We measured the level of corporate governance by using a corporate governance index, compiled separately by company, and based on information from companies` annual reports. The paper uses a correlation analysis to examine the association between the representation of women on boards and the level of corporate governance.

This is relevant because it is important to have a theoretical view of the processes in this important area of human life-housing policy-that have been happening in Lithuania for 25 years after the restoration of independence. They are directly related to the question of the quality of life of people living in a country that has freed itself from occupation. It is natural that housing policy plays quite an important role-so far it was understood in quite a narrow sense in Lithuania, i.e. most often only related to housing acquisition and disposition, and not in a much wider sense as presented in this work. On the other hand, we can see that pluralistic and civil processes are happening in a democratic country, expressed through the functioning of local communities. So when talking about a functional local community we must analyze its activities and its links with housing policy and housing in politics.","[Nefas, Saulius] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Polit & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Nefas, S (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Fac Polit & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.",saunef@mruni.eu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-46319-3; 978-3-319-46318-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,5.0,,,,,,745,755,,10.1007/978-3-319-46319-3_47,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH5KL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401101000047,0

We hypothesise that not only the degree of technological relatedness influence the extent of skill integration in a firm but also that familiarity with firm routines (intra-organisational proximity) should smoothen absorption. Longitudinal micro-data are used in pooled ordinary least square- and fixed effect models to estimate the impact on plant productivity growth of 18,051 labour flows within, and to, four large Swedish firms between 2003 and 2006. Our findings suggest that intra-regional related flows are economically beneficial. Their link to localised capabilities and community creates a weaker but more productive link between individuals than do organisational proximity, which generate too much similarity to allow for cognitively related inflows to impact productivity growth. Also, we find a positive relationship between unrelated flows and plant performance.","[Ostbring, Lisa; Eriksson, Rikard; Lindgren, Urban] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Östbring, L (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Umea, Sweden.",lisa.ostbring@umu.se,,"Eriksson, Rikard/0000-0003-3570-7690",,,,,47,4,4,3,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It accepts that Trump utilizes a populist pose but rejects populism as too reductive for understanding his ascension and constitutional challenge. First, it argues that, although he merits the designation, Trump reveals more about populism than populism does about him. Trump illustrates populism's conceptual elasticity, but employing it as a frame to understand him imposes coherence upon a figure whose monetized politics are chaotic, shallow and unanchored by principle. Second, populism provides a necessary but insufficient condition for critically explaining Trump's ascension, either in terms of electoral populism or populism in power. Third, while democratic deconsolidation under Trump's presidency cannot be discounted, the Constitution remains resilient in most important respects. A dispassionate constitutional sociology counsels a deflationary understanding rather than an uncritical alarmism that too frequently reproduces and reinforces the darker aspects of Trump's populist political logic.","[Singh, Robert] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Singh, R (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",r.singh@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,8,11,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Undoubtedly, these changes will also affect significantly the rural producers of goods and services, which are nowadays used to be protected thanks to CAP and thanks to ESF or SRDF in form of cross-boarder operational programs. Given the acknowledgement that their annual income from enterprising is lower than that of several other social groups and with the obvious tendency for a reduction in the domestic and European supportive intervention, many of the rural companies mainly family businesses look for the improvement of their income, for a series of supplementary, usually differentiated, employment activities (multiple-employment), often out of their local and regional scope, yet with no satisfactory results. Consequently, significant questions are nowadays raised, concerning their survival, the future of those companies with lower innovative power or intergenerational succession, and the designation of its social consequences.

Therefore, intermodal competition is of particular importance for this market. In this paper, we analyse the intermodal competition between intercity buses and railways. In particular, we analyse the price-setting behaviour of the German railway company DB Femverkehr AG in different competitive situations. Starting from the set of all long-distance connections between the larger German cities with daily train services, the ones with bus services are identified and frequencies are counted. In our analysis, we combine bus and railway data as well as general transport and socioeconomic data. A two-step cluster analysis is used to create homogenous transport markets. Within these clusters, a count data regression analysis is applied in order to analyse the number of special prices offered by DB Fernverkehr AG, as these are the most flexible price instruments of DB. Our results show, among others, that the railway budget prices are lower on routes with intermodal competition compared to monopolistic routes.","[Gremm, Cornelia] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Waldhornstr 27, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Gremm, C (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Waldhornstr 27, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",Cornelia.Gremm@kit.edu,,,,,,,27,10,10,4,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Studies on information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) argue that the use of ICTs like mobile phones, supports farmers by overcoming these constraints. Combining concepts about knowledge with relational and spatial proximity, this paper aims to contribute to the current debate on ICT4D studies. Based on a survey and qualitative interviews with horticultural small-scale farmers in the Mwanza region, Tanzania, we analyse the potential and limitations of mobile phone use to reduce spatial constraints in order to access different types of knowledge. Our results show the benefits of phone use to access particularly external knowledge can only fully take place if the users already possess external contacts that are, however, usually based on personal relationships in close spatial proximity.","[Krone, Madlen; Dannenberg, Peter] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Krone, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",madlen.krone@gmail.com; p.dannenberg@uni-koeln.de,"Dannenberg, Peter/J-5771-2016","Dannenberg, Peter/0000-0002-4159-6635",German Research Foundation (DFG) [DA1128 4-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to Alexander Follmann (Cologne), Joran Wrana (Cologne), Gideon Hartmann (Cologne) and the reviewers for their insightful comments on the earlier drafts.

A generalized Poisson model is used with a comprehensive data set containing most of the recently tendered bus contracts in Sweden, spanning the period 2007-2015. The main finding from the analysis is that most contract characteristics change participation in tenders by approximately 0.1-0.5 bidders. Operator restricting measures such as special requirement on buses have a similar limited effect. Further, the number of tenders that are open at the same time as a specific tender was shown to reduce participation by almost two bidders. Finally, there is evidence that the local competitive environment is of importance, and the public transport authorities therefore need to be concerned with entry barriers in their tenders.","[Vigren, Andreas] CTS, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Vigren, A (通讯作者)，VTI, Box 55685, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",andreas.vigren@vti.se,,"Vigren, Andreas/0000-0002-9219-8493",Centre for Transport Studies in Stockholm,Centre for Transport Studies in Stockholm,"The author is grateful to Svante Mandell, Jan-Eric Nilsson, Samuel Lindgren, and Sofia Lundberg for much appreciated help, comments, and suggestions while writing this paper.

Unlike traditional research taking the travel behaviour perspective, this study looked at cycling from the new mobilities perspective of travel being not only movement in space and time, but also an experience that leads to emotional well-being and satisfies human needs. Accordingly, this study proposed a behavioural framework to examine the intentions of inhabitants of a driving-oriented region to use conventional and electric bicycles within a hypothetical scenario of a bicycle sharing system. The behavioural framework was designed to assess the relations between intentions and characteristics of travellers in terms of socioeconomic traits, habitual travel, and human needs according to the ERG (existence, relatedness, growth) theory of needs. A web-based survey collected the information necessary to evaluate empirically the framework, and a hybrid bivariate ordered model estimated the hypothesised relations. The findings from the model revealed gender and age differences in the probability of using electric bicycles, as female as well as older respondents were more likely to prefer the technological innovation. Also, the findings from the model showed indeed relations between needs and the intentions to use bicycle sharing schemes: interestingly, while functional and relational needs were associated with a higher likelihood of using both types of bicycle, self actualisation needs were related to a higher probability of using a conventional bicycle and a lower one of using an electric bicycle. Accordingly, promoting bicycle sharing and more broadly cycling should not only focus on the value of moving from one place to the next, but also on the social and relational value of cycling as well as the self-actualisation potential.","[Kaplan, Sigal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Kaplan, Sigal] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, Bygningstorvet 116B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Wrzesinska, Dagmara K.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Quantitat Modelling &, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Prato, Carlo G.] Univ Queenslandm, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Technical University of Denmark; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Queensland,"Prato, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Queenslandm, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.prato@uq.edu.au,"Prato, Carlo Giacomo/C-6104-2016","Prato, Carlo Giacomo/0000-0002-1218-4922",,,,,60,29,29,7,70,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The Highway Capacity Manual is primarily used for operational analysis on two lane highways in the U.S. and Canada. As part of a project sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program for improving two-lane highway operational analysis methodology, a practice survey was conducted to gather information on agency experiences in regards to performance measurement on two-lane highways. The survey was sent to all state Departments of Transportation in the United States and Canada. A total of 35 usable responses were received, representing 25 states and 4 Canadian provinces. This paper summarizes the results of the agency survey and presents the most important findings. Results suggest that the top three criteria for good performance measures are: sensitivity to traffic conditions, sensitivity to road conditions, and relevance to road user perception. Further, agencies identified average travel speed as the most relevant traffic flow aspect to two-lane highway operations. Other performance measures that were found meritorious were volume-to-capacity ratio and flow rate, for class I and class II highways, respectively, versus the latter measures and percent-time-spent-following for class III highways.","[Al-Kaisy, Ahmed] Montana State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Jafari, Amirhossein] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Washburn, Scott] Univ Florida, Dept Civil & Coastal Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lutinnen, Tapio] Aalto Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Helsinki, Finland; [Dowling, Richard] Kittelson & Associates Inc, Portland, OR USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Aalto University,"Al-Kaisy, A (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",aalkaisy@ce.montana.edu; amirhossein.jafari@msu.montana.edu; swash@ce.ufl.edu; tapio.luttinen@aalto.fi; rdowling@kittelson.com,"Al-Kaisy, Ahmed/Q-6826-2019","Al-Kaisy, Ahmed/0000-0003-1198-0975; Washburn, Scott/0000-0002-5442-6790",National Cooperative Highway Research Program,National Cooperative Highway Research Program,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided for this study by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program.

This article contributes to this line of inquiry by analyzing the role of industry relatedness in explaining variations in industry diversification, measured as the entry of new industry specializations, across 173 European regions during the period 2004-2012. First, we show that there are significant differences across regions in Europe in terms of industrial diversification. Second, we provide robust evidence showing that the probability that a new industry specialization develops in a region is positively associated with the new industry's relatedness to the region's current industries. Third, a novel finding is that the influence of relatedness on the probability of new industrial specializations depends on innovation capacity of a region. We find that relatedness is a more important driver of diversification in regions with a weaker innovation capacity. The effect of relatedness appears to decrease monotonically as the innovation capacity of a regional economy increases. This is consistent with the argument that high innovation capacity allows an economy to break from its past and to develop, for the economy, truly new industry specializations. We infer from this that innovation capacity is a critical factor for economic resilience and diversification capacity.","[Xiao, Jing; Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, NL-3508 Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger Ctr Innovat Res, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Andersson, Martin] Blekinge Inst Technol BTH, Dept Ind Econ, S-37179 Karlskrona, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Utrecht University; Universitetet i Stavanger; Blekinge Institute Technology; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Xiao, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",jing.xiao@circle.lu.se; r.a.boschma@uu.nl; martin.andersson@bth.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021",,JPI Urban Europe project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional Perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being' [438-13-406],JPI Urban Europe project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional Perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being',We thank Nicola Cortinovis for sharing the cleansed and geo-coded version of the employment data for European regions.

We propose a modeling framework for analyzing the effects of IC on the oil market and for predicting the price volatility of crude oil's futures market. This novel approach decomposes the original time series into intrinsic modes at different time scales using bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD). The relationship between the oil price volatility and IC at an individual frequency is investigated. By utilizing decomposed intrinsic modes as specified characteristics, we also construct extreme learning machine (ELM) models with variant forecasting schemes. The experimental results illustrate that ELM models that incorporate intrinsic modes and IC outperform the baseline ELM and other benchmarks at distinct horizons. Having the power to improve the accuracy of baseline models, internet searching is a practical way of quantifying investor attention, which can help to predict short-run price fluctuations in the oil market.

The aim of this paper is twofold: to describe: (i) the ways in which volunteers and professionals make sense of and understand the multicultural neighbourhood; and (ii) how that impacts on collective civic action in the neighbourhood. The paper takes a small scale mixed-methods approach (9 semi structured interviews and a small scale quantitative survey (N = 39)), comparing two neighbourhoods with similar characteristics in terms of ethnic diversity and socio-economic problems. The findings show that problems associated with ethnicity are not the most pressing ones for recent migrants. Instead they struggle with work, housing, a lack of supportive networks, unfamiliarity with the educational system, and language problems. The paper concludes that the multicultural discursive framework is a salutary one for those working and living in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods.","[Dekker, Karien; Lee, Julian C.

Previous research has typically focused on either brand or certified label efficiency independently, while in many instances both signals coexist. Agricultural products that pair brand names and certified labels-such as indications of origin-are indeed common: e.g., Roquefort cheese, Scotch whiskeys, and most of the French wines. The objective of our paper is to take into account this coexistence by empirically analyzing the complementarity and/or substitutability that may exist between labels and brands. To do so, we estimate different models of adoption and an original multinomial probit model of complementarity that we test on a database of the quality-signaling strategies from 993 small French cooperatives. Our main result shows that there is a clear interaction effect between brand and certified label signal strategies, but it is a substitution effect rather than a complementary one.","[Fares, M'hand] INRA, UMR SELMET, 2 Pl Pierre Viala, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Raza, Saqlain] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Pk Rd, Islamabad 45550, Pakistan; [Thomas, Alban] INRA, LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",INRAE; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Fares, M (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR SELMET, 2 Pl Pierre Viala, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",mhand.fares@supagro.inra.fr; saqlain.raza@comsats.edu.pk; alban.thomas@inra.fr,"THOMAS, Alban/X-8092-2019; Raza, Saqlain/AAA-1888-2022; THOMAS, Alban/AAW-7849-2020; Raza, Saqlain/X-3612-2018","THOMAS, Alban/0000-0002-8730-2487; Raza, Saqlain/0000-0002-9899-5653",,,,,55,10,10,2,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The acquisition was consummated after the district and appellate courts ruled that Phoebe Putney had antitrust immunity due to its regulation by the local Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County. In February 2013, the Supreme Court reversed these rulings and remanded the case back to the lower courts, after Palmyra Medical Center had become part of Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, making a divestiture infeasible. The acquisition of Palmyra Medical Center by Phoebe Putney provides an opportunity to study the effects of an otherwise anticompetitive hospital merger subject to local regulation. We found that, after a large price spike in the first post-merger year, the commercial price of inpatient hospital services in Albany, Georgia, moderated toward the control group price in subsequent post-merger years. Regarding quality, we found a significant post-merger reduction in inpatient hospital quality relative to controls across many quality metrics. We discuss the implications of these findings for recent initiatives that grant hospitals antitrust immunity in exchange for local regulation.","[Garmon, Christopher] Univ Missouri, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Garmon, Christopher; Kmitch, Laura] Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Washington, DC 20580 USA; [Kmitch, Laura] Bates White Econ Consulting, Washington, DC USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Garmon, C (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",,,,,,,,22,4,5,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Implementing an efficient workflow may improve customer satisfaction and enhance productivity of an enterprise. Many optimization tools have been introduced to solve scheduling problems in the manufacturing environment, but most of them have not drawn much attention of decision makers for workflow analyses. This is mainly due to the difference between business operations and manufacturing processes that the process optimization tools cannot be directly applied for analyzing business workflows. Scholars have associated the attributes of workflow in the business environment with those of scheduling concepts to facilitate the use of job shop scheduling techniques for solving workflow problems. However, there is still not much discussion on the use of metaheuristic algorithms for workflow analyses. This paper proposes the use of a systematic approach that entails the ant colony optimization algorithm for identifying the best task sequence in support of processing time analyses. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a case example. The result shows that a better operation sequence in terms of shorter processing duration can be obtained by the proposed approach.","[Ng, C.

Drawing upon the emerging literature that views collaboration through the lens of networks, we explore why and how regional public transport authorities collaborate with both municipalities and public transport operators in the planning of public transport. We also explore the advantages and disadvantages of such collaborations. Based on interviews with civil servants (government officers) in the Swedish metropolitan regions of Stockholm, Vastra Gotaland and Scania, we conclude that collaboration is, firstly, a way for the regional public transport authorities (RPTA) to engage with the local municipalities and develop joint agreements on public transport priorities. It is also a way to build a common identity with the public transport operators, who operate services under tendered contracts. Secondly, we find that collaboration takes place during official meetings, as well as in informal conversations and face-to-face dialogues. Thirdly, the potential advantages and disadvantages of collaboration hinge on the ability of coordinating actors to put in place processes where the feasibility of plans can be established, and where a sense of common identity can be constructed.","[Paulsson, Alexander; Isaksson, Karolina; Sorensen, Claus Hedegaard; Hrelja, Robert] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, MAP Unit, Linkoping, Sweden; [Rye, Tom] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Scholten, Christina] Malmo Univ, Malmo, Sweden; [Paulsson, Alexander; Isaksson, Karolina; Sorensen, Claus Hedegaard; Hrelja, Robert; Rye, Tom; Scholten, Christina] Swedish Knowledge Ctr Publ Transport K2, Lund, Sweden",VTI; Edinburgh Napier University; Malmo University; Lund University,"Paulsson, A (通讯作者)，VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, MAP Unit, Linkoping, Sweden.",alexander.paulsson@vti.se; karolina.isaksson@vti.se; claus.h.sorensen@vti.se; robert.hrelja@vti.sev; T.Rye@napier.ac.uk; christina.scholten@mah.se,"Hrelja, Robert D/E-6744-2011; Hrelja, Robert/HGD-9302-2022; Lindkvist, Christina/E-6206-2016","Hrelja, Robert/0000-0002-9445-784X; Lindkvist, Christina/0000-0002-0672-8153; Isaksson, Karolina/0000-0002-3613-7039; Sorensen, Claus Hedegaard/0000-0003-1346-8094",Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA [2013-03020]; K2 - the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport; Vinnova [2013-03020] Funding Source: Vinnova,Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA(Vinnova); K2 - the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport; Vinnova(Vinnova),"This research has been carried out with financial support by, and in collaboration with, the Swedish Innovation Agency VINNOVA (Dnr 2013-03020) and K2 - the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Public Transport (2015-2017).

The jurisdictional task can be provided only by a judge (the agent) while the administrative task can be provided either by the government (the principal) and/or by the judge. However, the judge performs the administrative task at a higher unit cost. First, we show that the first-best situation is such that the judge exerts no effort to provide the administrative task. Second, we show that two forms of (second-best) optimal contract can emerge when neither the government's effort nor the judge's effort is contractible: either the incentives are shared between the government and the judge and the judge exerts no effort to provide the administrative task, or the judge faces high-powered incentives which induce her to exert effort to provide both tasks.

Drawing on a case study of Switzerland, this paper aims to look more closely at this discourse by examining the ways in which international passenger rail services (IPRS) are organized, how they perform and what factors influence their performance. Our findings stress that the development of IPRS has been somewhat more positive. Overall, service quality has increased, with more direct connections increasing their frequencies and shortening travel times, and night trains to southern and eastern Europe still being maintained. Nonetheless, IPRS are still not exploiting the full potential of the market due to a lack of market attractiveness, inconsistent service quality, high production costs, complexity, uncertainty and risks. IPRS are basically operated in accordance with three business models: the cooperative production model, the joint venture model, and the intramodal competition model. Our paper also suggests that the characteristics of these business models may have different degrees of impact on the development of IPRS.","[von Arx, Widar; Vu Thi Thao; Wegelin, Philipp; Frolicher, Jonas] Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Inst Tourism ITW, POB 2940,Rosslimatte 48, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland; [Maarfield, Simon] KCW, Bernburger Str 27, D-10963 Berlin, Germany",,"von Arx, W (通讯作者)，Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Inst Tourism ITW, POB 2940,Rosslimatte 48, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",widar.vonarx@hslu.ch; thaothi.vu@hslu.ch; philipp.wegelin@hslu.ch; Maarfield@kcw-online.de; jonas.froelicher@hslu.ch,"Thao, Vu Thi/JNR-0040-2023; von Arx, Widar/AAA-3024-2020","Thao, Vu Thi/0000-0001-9319-9028; von Arx, Widar/0000-0003-0868-0162; Wegelin, Philipp/0000-0002-7231-0302",,,,,55,5,5,1,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

Our model assumes that each individual prosecutor trades off a desire for career advancement (by winning a case) and a disutility for knowingly convicting an innocent defendant. We assume a population of prosecutors that is heterogeneous with respect to this disutility, and each individual's disutility rate is their own private information. A convicted defendant may later discover exculpatory information; a judge will then void the conviction and may order an investigation. Judges are also heterogeneous in their opportunity costs (which is each judge's private information) of pursuing suspected misconduct. We show that the equilibrium information configuration within the team involves concentration of authority about suppressing/disclosing evidence.

This paper tightens the theoretical bounds on the potential deadweight loss from such biases. Using a calibration of the global demand for HIV pharmaceuticals, we demonstrate the dramatically sharper analysis achievable with the new bounds, allowing us to pinpoint potential deadweight loss at 62% of the global gain from curing HIV. We use the calibration to perform policy counterfactuals, assessing welfare effects of government policies such as a subsidy, reference pricing, and price-discrimination ban. The fit of our calibration is good: we find that a hypothetical drug monopolist would price an HIV drug so high that only 4% of the infected population worldwide would purchase, matching actual drug prices and quantities in the early 2000s before subsidies in low-income countries ramped up.","[Kremer, Michael] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 207, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 301 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Harvard University; Dartmouth College,"Snyder, CM (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 301 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",mkremer@fas.harvard.edu; chris.snyder@dartmouth.edu,,,Dartmouth College's Presidential Scholars program,Dartmouth College's Presidential Scholars program,"The authors are grateful to the general editor, Lawrence White, the special-issue editor, Victor Tremblay, and anonymous reviewers for suggestions that substantially improved the paper; to Margaret Kyle, Paul Novosad, Douglas Staiger, Robert Staiger, Heidi Williams, and seminar participants at Penn State for insightful comments; and to John Caramichael, Matthew Goodkin-Gold, and Henry Senkfor for excellent research assistance.

Using an assessment of therapeutic value that is provided by the French Haute Authorit, de Sant, (HAS), I find a weak relationship between most measures of rewards and this assessment of therapeutic value, which suggests that the returns to developing a me-too product are not very different from developing treatments with greater therapeutic effects. One interpretation is that the HAS score is a poor assessment of therapeutic value, in which case the use of similar health technology assessments by governments and other payers should be re-examined. Alternatively, if the HAS score is informative, the results suggest that countries are overspending on less innovative products, and that a re-balancing of innovation incentives may be worth considering if therapeutic value is highly related to social welfare.","[Kyle, Margaret K.] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech CERNA, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kyle, Margaret K.] CEPR, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75005 Paris, France",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Kyle, MK (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech CERNA, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75005 Paris, France.;Kyle, MK (通讯作者)，CEPR, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75005 Paris, France.",margaret.kyle@mines-paristech.fr,,,,,,,19,6,6,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

There is, however, no consensus in the literature on whether it actually matters for wages, and if it does, what are the underlying mechanisms. We empirically examine these issues specifically for rural migrants in urban China, a country where one of the largest domestic migration in human history has occurred over the past decades. We find that there exists a significant wage penalty for those migrant workers who have conducted their search through informal channels, despite their popularity. Our further analysis suggests two potential reasons for the wage penalty: (1) the informal job search sends a negative signal (of workers' inability to successfully find a job in a competitive market) to potential employers, resulting in lower wages, and (2) there exists a trade-off between wages and search efficiency for quicker entry into local labor market. We also find some evidence that the informal job search may lead to low-skilled jobs with lower wages.

Progress has been limited owing to complexities in these industries and to the underlying ontology of the business model concept itself. Through a conceptual methodology, our findings expose impediments to current business model theory and propose economic evolutionary theory as a useful alternative lens through which to address these limitations. This research contributes to the literature by broadening the traditional scope of the economic evolutionary view as relevant for business model innovation research and by offering a corresponding framework for future research.","[Downs, James B.; Velamuri, Vivek K.] HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Grp Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management,"Downs, JB (通讯作者)，HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Grp Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",james.downs@hhl.de,,"Velamuri, Vivek K/0000-0002-7277-1360",,,,,75,6,10,1,45,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

Empirical research on process innovations lags behind product innovations. Accounting for firm characteristics, R&D, regulations and taxes, and corruption, results show that sole proprietors and R&D-performing firms were more likely to introduce innovations, whereas greater prosperity made them less likely to do so. Corruption had a greasing effect, whereas firms in island nations were less likely to introduce, ceteris paribus. Effects of regulations and taxes and other firm characteristics were largely insignificant. Finally, some differences existed across manufacturing and service industries and across prevalence of innovation introductions.","[Goel, Rajeev K.] Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Goel, Rajeev K.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Nelson, Michael A.] Univ Akron, Akron, OH 44325 USA",Illinois State University; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Goel, RK (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rkgoel@ilstu.edu,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023; Nelson, Michael Shawn/GXF-4934-2022","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",,,,,46,30,30,1,16,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

The police, fire, health and social service departments are tasked with mitigating such social harm through various types of interventions. While various different social harm indices have been proposed for allocating resources to spatially fixed hotspots, the risk of social harm events is dynamic, and new algorithms and software systems that are capable of quickly identifying risks and triggering appropriate public safety responses are needed. We propose a novel modulated Hawkes process for this purpose that offers flexible approaches to both (i) the incorporation of spatial covariates and leading indicators for variance reduction in the case of rarer event categories, and (ii) the capture of dynamic hotspot formation through self-excitation. We present an efficient l1-penalized EM algorithm for estimating the model that performs feature selection for the spatial covariates of each incident type simultaneously. We provide simulation results using data from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department in order to illustrate the advantages of the modulated Hawkes process model of social harm over various recently introduced social harm indices and property crime Hawkes processes.

Underinvestment in residential energy efficiency has been attributed to market failures and behavioural issues, which provides a basis for public policy intervention in provision of energy efficiency. This paper examines households' preferences for design features of energy efficiency retrofit subsidies and how these preferences vary across the usual respondent attributes. Based on a survey of Irish homeowners we find that cash payment subsidies are strongly preferred compared to other indirect methods of financial support such as tax credits, roughly by a 70:30 ratio. There are two notable areas where preferences differ by respondent attributes; age and whether respondents have previously availed of an energy efficiency retrofit grant. The preferences of older age cohorts differ compared to younger respondents across all the subsidy schemes examined, whereas people who have previously availed of retrofit grants are more likely to favour ex-post cash payments compared to upfront discounts.","[Collins, Matthew; Dempsey, Seraphim; Curtis, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Collins, Matthew] Sustainable Energy Author Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Curtis, John] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.;Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",John.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684; Dempsey, Seraphim/0000-0002-8505-693X",Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre,Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre,This research has been financially supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre.

We model contract enforcement as a game with perfect information but probabilistic enforcement and explore the implications of weak enforcement on the design of licensing contracts, the conduct of firms, and market performance. An upstream firm develops a technology that it can license to downstream firms using a fixed fee and a per-unit royalty. Strictly positive per-unit royalties maximize the licensor's profit if competition among licensees limits joint profits. With imperfect enforcement, the licensor lowers variable royalties to avoid cheating. Although imperfect contract enforcement reduces the profits of the licensor, weak enforcement lowers prices, increases downstream innovation, and in some circumstances can increase total economic welfare.","[Gilbert, Richard] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kristiansen, Eirik Gaard] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Gilbert, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rjgilbert@berkeley.edu; eirik.kristiansen@nhh.no,,,,,,,40,7,9,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In order to contribute to this question, we take a behavioral perspective and develop a theoretical framework that draws on pioneering work in social psychology, in particular, research on individuals' need for distinctiveness and argue that demographic similarity to their CEO predecessors may evoke negative affect as it threatens CEO successors' need for distinctiveness. Assuming that CEOs are high need for distinctiveness individuals, we argue that negative emotions associated with similarity to their CEO predecessors are likely to force CEO successors to engage in behavioral coping strategies aimed at restoring a sense of distinctiveness.

Setting: Implementation of green supply chain management activities by South African SMEs is necessary, given both the high failure rate of such enterprises in the country and the proven ability of such activities to promote the success of businesses. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between green supply chain management activities, operational performance and supply chain performance in manufacturing SMEs in South Africa. Methods: Data were collected from 219 manufacturing SMEs operating within Gauteng. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of measurement scales. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. Results: Four green supply chain management activities, namely green purchasing, reverse logistics, environmental collaboration with suppliers and green manufacturing, exerted a positive influence on operational performance. Environmental collaboration with suppliers exerted the highest influence on operational performance when compared to green purchasing, reverse logistics and green manufacturing. In turn, operational performance exerted a strong positive influence on supply chain performance. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that manufacturing SMEs in developing countries could benefit by adopting green supply chain management activities, with improvements being realised in terms of increases in both operational and supply chain performance.","[Mafini, Chengedzai; Loury-Okoumba, Welby, V] Vaal Univ Technol, Fac Management Sci, Dept Logist, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa",Vaal University of Technology (VUT),"Mafini, C (通讯作者)，Vaal Univ Technol, Fac Management Sci, Dept Logist, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.",chengedzaim@vut.ac.za,"MAFINI, CHENGEDZAI/KAM-7235-2024",,Faculty of Management Sciences at Vaal University of Technology,Faculty of Management Sciences at Vaal University of Technology,The authors would like to thank the Faculty of Management Sciences at Vaal University of Technology for providing the resources used in undertaking this study.

This paper examines how high dependence on farebox revenue could have been avoided by using Land Value Capture (LVC) to finance Mumbai Metro. A panel data hedonic price model was used to assess the impact of Mumbai Metro's commencement on approximately 66,000 apartments. The model shows a significant uplift of 14% in property prices in the Mumbai Metro catchment area resulting in USD 179 million value capture opportunity under Mumbai's existing legislative framework.

The model takes into account the fact that travellers may not arrive randomly at the ferry terminals due to long headways, and it demonstrates in a clear way the influences of crossing and ferry fleet characteristics on optimal frequency. Using Norwegian data for ferry users' time costs and for the costs of operating ferry services, the model's results indicate that the authorities recommend too low a frequency, especially on high-traffic ferry crossings. The results also emphasise that the length of the crossing has a great impact on optimal frequency; optimal frequency at long crossings is less than half that of short crossings for all levels of traffic. Lastly, the model shows that it is more serious from a welfare perspective to undersupply frequency with X units than to oversupply it with X units.","[Jorgensen, Finn; Solvoll, Gisle] Nord Univ, Business Sch, NO-8049 Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Solvoll, G (通讯作者)，Nord Univ, Business Sch, NO-8049 Bodo, Norway.",finn.jorgensen@nord.no; gisle.solvoll@nord.no,,,,,,,32,11,11,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

In particular, the pinball loss used in classical quantile estimators is improved into novel orthogonal pinball loss (OPL) by replacing vertical loss by orthogonal loss. Accordingly, linear quantile regression (QR) and support vector machine quantile regression (SVMQR) can be respectively extended into novel OPL-based QR and OPL-based SVMQR models. The empirical study on 10 publicly available datasets statistically verifies the superiority of the two OPL-based models over their respective original forms in terms of prediction accuracy and quantile property, especially for extreme quantiles. Furthermore, the novel OPL-based SVMQR model with both OPL and artificial intelligence (AI) outperforms all benchmark models, which can be used as a promising quantile estimator, especially for noisy data.","[Yu, Lean] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ling] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zebin] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Chemical Technology; Beihang University; University of Hong Kong,"Yu, L (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Tang, L (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",yulean@amss.ac.cn; tangling_00@126.com,,"Yu, Lean/0000-0002-8035-4938; Yang, Zebin/0000-0001-5683-7502","Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71433001, 71631005]; National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars [71622011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301006]; National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals",Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals,"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 71433001 and 71631005; National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars, Grant/Award Number: 71622011; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 71301006; National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals",,23,7,8,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

In this context, the company-driven contract farming model and the member-based model of producer organizations are discussed by practitioners and in the scholarly literature as alternatives to traditional market systems. This study compares the models' abilities to address economic challenges of highly fragmented and small-scale dominated agriculture on a household as well as on an aggregate level. It analyzes empirical data from the Indian floriculture sector with the global value chain approach. The study reveals that the smallholders perceive both contract farming and producer organization to be beneficial for their households' economic risk situation, while only the producer organization has a positive effect on the households' income. The contract farming benefits production and value chain efficiency, whereas the producer organization does not show an impact in these respects. We thus observe that the contract farming model increases value creation in the overall chain, but it does not raise the producer's value capture; while the producer organization model does not heighten value creation in the overall chain, but it lifts the producers' value capture. The organization's individual capabilities determine how each model addresses the economic challenges. Overall, the author argues that contract farming and producer organizations are supplementing, not competitive, strategies and should be applied in combination.","[Gersch, Inka] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Geog, Seminarstr 19Ab, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Gersch, I (通讯作者)，Univ Osnabruck, Inst Geog, Seminarstr 19Ab, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany.",inka.gersch@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,75,4,4,1,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

Consistent with the findings for the US housing market, we find that the forecasts from an autoregressive model dominate the forecasts from the random walk model for most of the countries in our sample. More importantly, we find that the forecasts from a bivariate model that includes economically important domestic macroeconomic variables and two global indicators of the housing market significantly improve upon the univariate autoregressive model forecasts. Among all the variables, the mean square forecast error from the model with the country's domestic interest rates has the best performance for most of the countries. The country's income, industrial production, and stock markets are also found to have valuable information about the future movements in real house price growth. There is also some evidence supporting the influence of the global housing price growth in out-of-sample forecasting of real house price growth in these OECD countries.","[Kishor, N.

When we include these measures in the second-stage salary equation, their impact on pay reflects bargaining power, not productivity.

I argue these actions are better studied as delegation. I model the conditions under which a president is likely to delegate and provide discretion to subordinates either insulated or uninsulated from their control. I find legislators benefit from agency discretion when presidents pursue policymaking in the executive branch. The threat of legislative sanction induces agents to deviate from presidential priorities, and inter-branch disagreement increases bureaucratic non-compliance in insulated agencies. Nonetheless, in equilibrium, the president is more likely to delegate to insulated agents. Ultimately, the model demonstrates how the politics of direct action are influenced by the need for bureaucratic cooperation. Case studies on US presidential directives mandating public funding of gun violence research and security reforms at government facilities illustrate key features of the model.","[Lowande, Kenneth] Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Democrat Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Lowande, K (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Democrat Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",lowande@princeton.edu,,,,,,,38,16,18,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In particular, we investigate whether firms participating in the Responsible Care (RC) program experience less pressure from Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspections. We use three indicators of regulatory relief: the overall probability of an inspection regardless of its type, the probability of a planned inspection relative to other inspection types, and the intensity of planned inspections. The probability of a planned inspection is our primary indicator of regulatory relief because it is the only inspection type that is not triggered by facilities' contemporaneous performance. We find strong evidence of regulatory relief: RC participants experienced fewer and possibly more lenient planned inspections than non-RC participants. While this was not enough to lower the overall probability of an inspection, the greater stringency of planned inspections translates into significantly less regulatory attention.","[Li, Huan] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Khanna, Neha] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Li, H (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Factually, it can be explained that the districts/cities having economic basis in more than three sectors of economic tend to have relatively higher economic growth, and then the districts/cities having more than three sectors of basis economic and higher economic growth tend to have more equitable income distribution and vice versa.","[Amar, Syamsul; Ariusni; Satrianto, Alpon] Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Padang,"Amar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Negeri Padang, Padang, Indonesia.",syamsul_amar3@yahoo.com; Ariusni.fe.unp@gmail.com; Alpon.unp@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-703-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,64.0,,,,,,146,154,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9GP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470910100018,0

The interest of researchers in this important component of the immaterial capital of a business, which surfaced since the beginnings of the 1990s, is due to the fact human capital has become an essential key to the competitiveness of the business itself. In the current theoretical approaches, the intangible resources are in the core of the process of the value's creation.

The method has been developed base on relevant literature and practical experience in renewable energy projects (RES). More specifically, the decisional model is based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the process that resulted from the decision was achieved through Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS). AHP highlighted the decision to choose the optimal raw material for a RES piece and ARIS configured the public procurement process receiving 3 offers from different supplier that were selected base on an important criterion, namely the delivery time. ARIS program has indicated certain rules when creating the model, in order to ensure that the required items and information are reliable. The bids that have been received correspond with the cost estimation in the tender specification. Suppliers who offered the maintenance service at a lower price after the warranty period expired (2 years period) were considered the most viable option in choosing the offer.

More precisely, the paper ethnographically traces how the capacity of tropical forests to act as carbon sinks is turned into a matter of global concern. The focus is on a negotiated policy called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and its anchoring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose territory contains the second largest area of rainforest after Brazil. The paper discusses the importance of the promissory in climate actions, the multivalence of what is at stake and the porosity and resilience of national demarcation. To do so, it identifies three moments and sites of geopolitical re-composition: the formulation of international consensus, the work of preparatory agents and the quest for metrological inclusiveness. These moments and sites point to the theatricality and semi-secrecy of United Nations negotiations, the mobilizing activities of expatriate consultants hired with overseas aid funding and the unstable evidential grounds on which emission reduction efforts are based. The paper suggests that, through this series of processes, the carbon stored by tropical forests becomes a matter of global exigency.","[Ehrenstein, Vera] Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Ehrenstein, V (通讯作者)，Goldsmiths Univ London, Dept Sociol, London SE14 6NW, England.",v.ehrenstein@gold.ac.uk,,,European Research Council [313173]; European Research Council (ERC) [313173] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),The paper has been written thanks to a European Research Council grant [no. 313173] held by Daniel Neyland.,,62,12,12,5,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main results show that contrary to the twin deficit hypothesis government balance had nonsignificant and negative association with current account. On the other hand, fixed exchange rate regime contributed to the accumulation of current deficits, especially during the boom years.

It is indicated that divergence between current and government balance is associated with the fluctuations of the economic activity, since the increase in government revenues during the good years reduced deficits despite pro-cyclical fiscal policy. Also, it has been argued that in the period prior to the crisis, in the countries pursuing fixed regimes current deficit was accumulated at higher pace when compared to countries with floating regimes, despite appreciation pressures deriving from the large inflow of foreign capital. Based on the results of empirical analysis, the recommendations on benefits of floating regimes are given to policy makers in CEE countries.","[Grubisic, Zoran] Belgrade Banking Acad, Int Finance, Macroecon, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia; [Kamenkovic, Sandra] Belgrade Banking Acad, Publ Finance, Macroecon, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia; [Zdravkovic, Aleksandar] Inst Econ Sci, Publ Finance, Macroecon, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia",Institute of Economic Sciences,"Grubisic, Z (通讯作者)，Belgrade Banking Acad, Int Finance, Macroecon, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia.",grubisic@bba.edu.rs; sandra.kamenkovic@bba.edu.rs; aleksandar.zdravkovic@ien.bg.ac.rs,"Grubisic, Zoran/AAH-3834-2019; Zdravković, Aleksandar/AAR-9271-2020","Zdravković, Aleksandar/0000-0002-6208-097X; Kamenkovic, Sandra/0000-0003-4550-9890; Grubisic, Zoran/0000-0003-3139-8878","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III47009, OI179015]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","This Paper is a part of research projects No. III47009, European Integrations and Socioeconomic Changes in the Economy of Serbia on the Way to the EU, project manager Professor Bozo Draskovic and OI179015, Challenges and Prospects of Structural Changes in Serbia: Strategic Directions of Economic Development and Harmonization with the EU Requirements, project manager Professor Ivan Stosic, financed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,52,4,4,0,3,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

First, national and West Java data on the number of women entrepreneurs and their main characteristics are very limited. Second, public interest in women entrepreneurs in Indonesia has just been revealed after the Asian financial crisis was driven primarily by the introduction of the MDGs. The purpose of this study is to reveal the typology of West-Javanese women entrepreneurs engaged in fashion. The research employed explanatory survey. Research conducted on womenpreneur who manages SMEs of fashion in West Java. The population consists of 452 people and 200 of them were taken as the sample by using proportional random sampling technique. The typology of women entrepreneurs was analyzed based on the factors of age, marital status, education, main occupation, and type of business ownership. The results show that the fashion womenpreneur typology in West Java covers young age, highly educated, unmarried, and owning company. Therefore, the West Java Government needs to develop and pay attention to the potential of womenpreneur in West Java because they can help the program of family poverty alleviation.","[Hendrayati, Heny; Gaffar, Vanessa; Budiman, Arief] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Management, Bandung, Indonesia; [Ridwanudin, Oce] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Management Resort & Leisure, Bandung, Indonesia",Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia; Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia,"Hendrayati, H (通讯作者)，Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Management, Bandung, Indonesia.",henyhendrayati@upi.edu; vanessa@upi.edu; arief.budiman@upi.edu; oceridwanudin@gmail.com,"Hendrayati, Heny/GOJ-9897-2022; Gaffar, Vanessa/N-5129-2019; Ridwanudin, Oce/GSN-3073-2022; Budiman, Arief/GSE-3393-2022","Gaffar, Vanessa/0000-0003-3304-8679; Budiman, Arief/0000-0001-6453-7147",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-723-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,65.0,,,,,,119,122,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN2FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000476673700029,0

In recent times, bankruptcy of manufacturing companies rapidly increased due to the impact of the recession, which produces economic and social problems accordingly. Therefore, the need for bankruptcy prediction models is very high. From various types of classification models we chose Support vector machines method with spline, hyperbolic tangent and RBF ANOVA kernels, Decision trees, Random forests and Adaptive boosting to acquire best results. Pre-processing is enhanced with filter based feature selection like Gain ratio and Relief algorithm to acquire attributes with the best information value. As we can see both filtering methods offers different variables to be used in the classification and Decision trees wrapper algorithm chose less number than its competitors. Suitable attributes as ROA, Interest cover, Solvency ratio based on assets and Operating revenues were mostly used but it also changes across the time, which are probably very obtainable. It is apparent that inappropriate theoretical value of one variable does not necessarily lead to bankruptcy, so it is better to use combinations of these variables. From the results it is obvious that with the rising distance to the bankruptcy there drops precision of bankruptcy prediction. The last year (2013) with avaible financial data offers best total prediction accuracy, thus we also infer both the Error I and II types for better recognizance of misclassification rates. The Random forest and Decision trees offer better accuracy for bankruptcy prediction than SVM method, both method offers prediction accuracy which is comparable to previous empirical studies.","[Klepac, Vaclav; Hampel, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Klepác, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic.",xklepac@node.mendelu.cz; david.hampel.uso@mendelu.cz,"Hampel, David/B-6765-2013","Hampel, David/0000-0002-3865-5948",Internal Grant Agency FBE MENDELU under project: Testing of models for multi-variate analysis and prediction of credit risk [19/2015],Internal Grant Agency FBE MENDELU under project: Testing of models for multi-variate analysis and prediction of credit risk,The paper was supported by the Internal Grant Agency FBE MENDELU under project: Testing of models for multi-variate analysis and prediction of credit risk (No. 19/2015).,,35,11,11,7,43,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The aim of this article is to present the results of the research that focused on comparing the positions of the selected group of countries at the threshold of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in terms of their performance and competitiveness. The analysis is aimed at 13 countries - the six largest economies of the world and seven economies of the former Soviet bloc - from 1993 to 2015 using the localization quotient and index of regional concentration of the industry on the basis of gross added value, supplemented by the SHADE model, the Balassa index and evaluating the comparative advantage of countries in the area of ICT. The research defines the position pattern of countries for the manufacturing and ICT industries. It cannot be said that the differences in localization, resp. the concentration of the industries surveyed were determined by the size of the economy or its membership of traditional market economies. Exportability in ICT goods positively evaluates those economies that have managed to increase their positive Balassa index over time, resp. to get from its negative values to positive ones.

One of the most ambitious projects in the history of the harmonization effort was introduced on 16 March 2011, when the European Commission published, after more than ten years of work, the text of the CCCTB Directive proposal. The directive proposal suggests the consolidation regime and the allocation formula with three equally weighted factors sales, labour and assets, i.e. the consolidated tax base should be shared among the members of the group based on those micro factors. That tax-sharing mechanism as a new allocation rule has raised much discussion and will definitely have an impact on EU Member States' budgets. The aim of the paper is to research the impact of mandatory CCCTB implementation in the Eurozone on tax bases in the Czech Republic and consequently on Czech corporate tax revenues, and to identify whether the implementation of the system in the Eurozone will result in the outflow or inflow of tax bases from/to the Czech Republic. The research is based on empirical data from the Amadeus and Bankscope databases covering 2,424 parent companies with 3,860 Czech subsidiaries. In order to verify the results of the research, a sensitivity analysis was also performed. The research revealed that mandatory implementation of the CCCTB system in the Eurozone would have negative impact on the tax bases currently generated and located in the Czech Republic. As a result of this fact, the Czech Republic would lose between 0.87% and 8.84% of the corporate tax liability recorded in 2011.","[Nerudova, Danuse; Solilova, Veronika] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxat, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Nerudová, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxat, Brno, Czech Republic.",d.nerudova@seznam.cz; ritve@email.cz,"Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012; Solilova, Veronika/U-1720-2017","Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107; Solilova, Veronika/0000-0002-9122-539X",GA CR project The quantification of the impact of the introduction of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base on the budget revenues in the Czech Republic [13-21683S],GA CR project The quantification of the impact of the introduction of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base on the budget revenues in the Czech Republic,The paper presents the results of the research within the GA CR project No. 13-21683S The quantification of the impact of the introduction of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base on the budget revenues in the Czech Republic.,,46,2,2,0,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Since the country shifted to a market economy, yet remaining under the leadership of the Communist Party, the term has come to imply the individualization of responsibilities and the privatization of public goods. As a policy, however, it continues to evoke the idioms of the whole society' or all the people' as the basis of wellbeing and development. This paper examines the practices of socialization as part of broader shifts in welfare provision and local dynamics of exemplarity. I show that socialization concerns not only the mobilization of resources, but also the production of a moral subject that is self-optimized and yet sensitized to helping others, self-governed and yet governable by the party state. In a socialist country that is rapidly marketising, this moral subject plays into governing rationalities that blends new-prudentialist logics with socialist genealogies, privatization with a notion of society within which individual actions can be made morally meaningful. While the tension and contestation induced by people's greater burdens are immanent, the continued reference to collective idioms appeals to people's moral sensibilities, and thus makes socialization meaningful to some extent, even as they resent the turn away from broad-based structures of wellbeing.","[Nguyen, Minh T.

Descriptive, correlation and panel regression techniques were adopted on 250 sampled banks form 30 countries. The results revealed that impaired loan ratio (ILR) has a direct and significant relationship with Return on Asset (ROA), while unimpaired loan ratio (LCR) has an inverse relationship with ROA, even though this relationship is insignificant. In addition, a restricted F-test was conducted and revealed that loan diversification has a cross-sectional uniqueness or heterogeneity effect on bank performance, while the Hausman test carried out showed that the fixed-effect model was the most efficient and consistent parameter estimate Thus, commercial banks need to revisit their loan structures both in terms and repayment modes to ensure that all loans they disburse are impaired, as this is positively and significantly related to the enhancement of their performance level. Also, banks should carry out their loan diversification practices in line with the adequate considerations of human capital training, development, and deployment, so as to ensure the attainment of the benefits of diversification on their performance.","[Olarewaju, Odunayo Magret] Durban Univ Technol, Fac Accounting & Informat, Dept Management & Accounting, Durban, South Africa",Durban University of Technology,"Olarewaju, OM (通讯作者)，Durban Univ Technol, Fac Accounting & Informat, Dept Management & Accounting, Durban, South Africa.",odunayoo@dut.ac.za,"OLAREWAJU, ODUNAYO MAGRET/AAU-1024-2020","OLAREWAJU, ODUNAYO MAGRET/0000-0002-4366-040X",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-723-2,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,65.0,,,,,,799,804,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN2FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000476673700167,0

On the other hand, there are so many cases (online social campaigns) that managed to raise awareness or create change. Also it is not possible to think of the activism of the 21st century apart from the Internet and social media. Thus slacktivists who mediate the spread of social campaigns became important actors for social marketing. Also understanding the slacktivist motivation and behavior is getting more attention in the literature. So the aim of this research is to determine the engagement motivations behind slacktivism. To understand the phenomenon better we have conducted a qualitative research and interviewed with ten participants (six man and four woman). We identified seven different motivations; self-presentation (or impression management), moral identity, social identity, perception of injustice, collective efficacy, issue involvement (or consciousness) and inform-inspire and prompt an action. In the second phase we have conducted an online survey, in order to determine the engagement motivations behind slacktivism in a larger sample. After the pilot study, the survey was conducted between April-August 2018. We found that social identity, moral identity, issue involvement and inform/inspire/prompt action motives are significant predictors of slacktivist behaviors. On the other hand, we also found that social identity, moral identity, non-affective injustice, collective efficacy, and inform/inspire/prompt action motives differentiates the degree of slacktivist/activist behaviors of the respondents. Contrary to the literature we couldn't find self-presentation or impression management as a significant predictor of slacktivism but this may be due to the survey method as participants also continue to manage their impressions.","[Ozbas, Hatice] Anadolu Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Ozata, F.

The paper's assessment of the past 16 years is somewhat bitter sweet. On the positive side, there has been a major reallocation of labor resources away from agriculture into the rest of the economy without any major disruption in wages, unemployment levels and inflation as it had been in previous resource booms. Yet, most employment created during that period-notably in commerce and transport and communication-has been in jobs paying wages that are roughly equal or below the economy's average. Wages in these sectors have been increasing broadly in line with productivity growth, thus keeping unit labor costs (ULCs) largely unchanged despite underlying inflation. The inertia of ULCs growth should have, in principle, spurred a tighter growth of households' real income, consumption and savings than otherwise. The findings from this paper are consistent with the world trend towards precarious labor conditions, especially for those youngsters entering the labor force. In a way, the emerging gig economy in the United States and other industrialized countries has been the Peruvian labor market's reality for decades to date. From a cyclical condition, widespread underemployment has become a structural condition in the country's economic reality. Policies to secure adequate health care and pension benefits are a latent concern for the country authorities and will require bold decisions in devising and implementing lasting changes for the benefit of the society, overall.","[Pastor, Gonzalo] Fdn Ariel, Lima, Peru; [Larios Meono, J.

Chosen innovation concepts can be applied when solving following problems: Identifying the innovation potential, organizational readiness for innovation and achieved levels of innovation climate, or the actual implementation of the innovation process and the evaluation of innovation. It is worth noting that concrete innovation concepts are not at the same level of usability in practice, some of them need to be better specified for application in business. A set of innovation concepts was created and evaluated the usability of individual concepts in the enterprise. The evaluation was carried out by qualitative analysis using selected criteria, which were determined by an expert group with the assistance of the researcher. Variants of usability of innovation concepts were defined subsequently. At the same time, decision-making model based on the Analytic Hierarchical Process was designed and applied in order to classify innovation concepts.

We make four main contributions to the existing literature. First, our characterisation of knowledge context provides the basis for a more specific identification of which elements of firms' knowledge environment are important for innovation, discriminating between spatial, sectoral and network influences. Second, we reflect the role of innovation ambition in shaping firms' knowledge search strategies. Third, we differentiate between firms' interactive and non-interactive knowledge search activities and recognise that these may be complemented by unanticipated and serendipitous knowledge spillovers. Finally, we employ the notion of encoding capacity to reflect firms' internal ability to assimilate and apply external knowledge, and clarify its distinctiveness from the more general concept of absorptive capacity. Our framework provides an integrating mechanism for existing empirical studies, and suggests a number of new research directions related to the determinants of innovation performance and the heterogeneity of innovation outcomes.","[Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Enterprise Res Ctr, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Love, James H.] Univ Leeds, Enterprise Res Ctr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Love, James H.] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Warwick; University of Warwick; University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Roper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Enterprise Res Ctr, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Roper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",stephen.roper@wbs.ac.uk,"ALTUN, Emin/ITV-0133-2023",,"Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) [ES/K006614/1]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); Innovate UK; British Business Bank","Enterprise Research Centre (ERC); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); British Business Bank","This work has been supported by the Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) [grant number ES/K006614/1].

Universities at some points provide entrepreneurship skills to their students so as to prepare the students on setting up their own businesses instead of depending and relying on getting paid jobs in their chosen industries. However, Social entrepreneurship is different from traditional entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship does not look at the profit only, but focuses on the impact of business to the society while on the other hand, traditional entrepreneurship deals with the implementation of such ideas to do business and get more profit. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the importance of social entrepreneurship in higher education via a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach adopted from Kitchenham (2004). This paper offers systematic investigation into the importance and approaches of social entrepreneurship in higher education using extant literature as the basis of analysis and discussion. The importance of social entrepreneurship in higher education can produce graduates that have significant knowledge and skills of being a social entrepreneur as well as have relevant disciplinary knowledge and skills, ethics and morality. There are many approaches that are being used by the universities to help these students.","[Roslan, Muhammad Hamirul Hamizan; Hamid, Suraya; Norman, Azah Anir; Ghani, Norjihan Abdul] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Ijab, Mohamad Taha] Natl Univ Malaysia, IVI, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Yusop, Farrah Dina] Univ Malaya, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Roslan, MHH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",hamirulhamizan@um.edu.my; suraya_hamid@um.edu.my; taha@ukm.edu.my; azahnorman@um.edu.my; farah@um.edu.my; norjihan@um.edu.my,"ABDUL GHANI, NORJIHAN/B-9381-2010; YUSOP, FARRAH DINA/AAD-3709-2020; Norman, Azah Anir/B-8276-2010; Hamid, Suraya/B-9864-2010; Ijab, Mohamad Taha/J-4166-2016; Hamid, Suraya/JCE-1921-2023","YUSOP, FARRAH DINA/0000-0002-5796-4463; Hamid, Suraya/0000-0001-9075-7338;","University of Malaya, Malaysia [RP044A-17HNE, BKS083-2017]","University of Malaya, Malaysia(Universiti Malaya)","This work is financially supported by a grant RP044A-17HNE and BKS083-2017 from University of Malaya, Malaysia.",,53,1,1,2,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3648,3664,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800077,0

Also, the current linear economy, in which non-renewable natural resources are exploited in order to extract raw materials from which end-products whose life cycle is relatively short are obtained, led to the massive increase of waste. In the context of solving these problems, we discuss the concept of circular economy (CE), which is based on technological, social and organizational innovation and involves the use of the same resources in several manufacturing cycles through the recycling and the reuse of some products. It also presupposes the shift from the use of fossil fuels to the use of renewable resources. The paper proposes a theoretical model on the correlation of the CE concept principles in the process of products/ services innovation development in the current context in which the digitization of processes is being discussed more and more. The use of the model proposed may have favorable effects for the goods/ services companies, which have to adapt to current policies and legislation, since these raise the issue of reducing the volume of waste.","[Rosu, Maria Magdalena; Rohan, Rodica] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Mfg Engn Dept, Sect 6,Splaiul Independentei 313, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Rosu, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Mfg Engn Dept, Sect 6,Splaiul Independentei 313, Bucharest, Romania.",magdalena.rosu@upb.ro; rodica.rohan@gmail.com,,"Rosu, Maria Magdalena/0000-0002-9243-7060",,,,,7,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6806,6813,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207077,0

In contrast with the state of the art, in which socio-demographic information is usually employed to explain vehicle ownership decisions, we highlight how the quality of travel offered by a given mode of transportation in serving one's activity pattern influences the ownership of a mode of transport. To implement this approach, we employ a two-level model: first, we estimate the mode choice for performing a set of activities, and second, we use the results of the mode choice calibration to estimate an ownership model. We also show the need to estimate this two-step model, originally modelled as a two-step multinomial logit, with more complex logit structures. With the aim to consider all possible correlations included in each step, a Mixed Logit model and a Cross-nested logit model are employed. Finally, the influence of the socio-demographic information on the quality of travel offered by a given transport mode in performing a particular activity is discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we use a Muth-type equilibrium displacement model to investigate the market and welfare impacts of this tax, utilizing a vertical linkage between log and lumber markets and considering factor substitution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that, without considering the vertical linkage, the negative effects of log export tax on equilibrium price for log producers is underestimated when logs and processing services are gross substitutes, and the direction of bias is uncertain when they are gross complements. Empirical simulations show that the burden of Russian log export tax is shared almost equally between foreign log buyers and domestic log producers and that the tax increases domestic lumber production. Further, the marginal effect of the log export tax on domestic lumber production decreases as Russian domestic demand share of logs increases. Overall, the welfare gains for Russian lumber consumers, lumber producers in the form of quasi-rents to processing services, and tax revenue exceed the loss in its logging sector.

We argue that those Guidelines were perceived by the market as a real change in enforcement policy that would result in substantial deregulation of mergers throughout the economy. We conduct an event study of S&P 500 firms to test this hypothesis and find evidence of a significant positive effect on the stock prices of firms in moderately concentrated industries subject to antitrust regulation, the firms for which the 1982 Guidelines articulate a substantially less intrusive enforcement policy. However, the announcement does not have any significant effect on firms in less concentrated industries or those that are highly concentrated. These results are robust to a number of different sensitivity analyses and thus we conclude that market actors believed the 1982 Guidelines contained new information.","[Meese, Alan J.] William & Mary Law Sch, Law, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Meese, Alan J.] William & Mary Ctr Study Law & Mkt, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Stafford, Sarah L.] Coll William & Mary, Publ Policy Econ & Law, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary; William & Mary,"Meese, AJ (通讯作者)，William & Mary Law Sch, Law, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.;Meese, AJ (通讯作者)，William & Mary Ctr Study Law & Mkt, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",ajmees@wm.edu; slstaf@wm.edu,,"Stafford, Sarah/0000-0003-2233-5728",William and Mary Faculty Interdisciplinary Initiatives Grant - Andrew W.

The four GARCH models employed are BEKK GARCH, DCC GARCH, DCC-MIDAS GARCH and Gaussian-copula GARCH. The data consist of daily stock prices from 2001 to 2013 from two large banks each from Austria, Belgium, Greece, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. We apply the rolling forecasting method and the model confidence sets (MCS) to compare the daily forecasting ability of the five models during one month of the pre-crisis (January 2007) and the crisis (January 2013) periods. Based on the MCS results, the BEKK proves the best model in the January 2007 period, and the Kalman filter overly outperforms the other models during the January 2013 period.

Elaborating data provided by ISTAT in the 2013 survey 'Aspects of daily life, we develop an indicator of perceived quality of urban public transport, measuring the progress made at the regional level in last ten years. Following a customer-based approach, we consider the opinions of the users on the service and formalize a methodology to compare an indicator over time, through a structured approach that can be replicated in different urban contexts. The survey results highlight (i) an increase in the overall levels of user satisfaction in Italy between the first observation (2002) and the second one (2012); (ii) a very limited relation between perceived quality and use both in the first and in the second year of observation; (iii) a positive and increasingly strong relation between perceived quality and satisfaction with the ticket price; finally, (iv) no relation between the satisfaction with the ticket price and the use of local public transport in both years considered. This work aims to suggest effective ideas for action to LPT companies and Public Administration, by breaking up the abstract and all-encompassing concept of quality into its single constituents, and analysing them more precisely. On the foreground we put the concept of mobility as a system and not as a loose set of individual components.","[Burlando, Claudia] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Genoa, Italy; [Ivaldi, Enrico] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Ivaldi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Genoa, Italy.",enrico.ivaldi@unige.it,"Ivaldi, Enrico/AAI-7178-2020","Ivaldi, Enrico/0000-0001-6687-9378",,,,,44,2,2,0,11,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Evidence from Broiler Businesses,MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WHEAT FARMERS; VARIABLES,"This paper ascertains whether managerial ability really drives cost efficiency of broiler businesses. Data was collected from 354 broiler businesses in Ghana and analysed using a modified stochastic Cobb-Douglas cost frontier and inefficiency effect models in a single-stage maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Results indicate that managerial abilities such as technical advice, age and experience acquired through full-time farming and increased batches significantly drive cost efficiency. This highlights the need to provide more technical advice and implement periodic capacity building programmes to develop the managerial ability and competences of broiler producers. The youth should also be encouraged and supported through skills development fund to go into full-time broiler business to produce more batches.

We investigate whether gold mining is a catalyst for early stages of urbanization in rural Ghana. We call this phenomenon proto-urbanization. Using cross-sectional data, we find that locations with gold mines exhibit most of the tell-tale signs of proto-urbanization. They have higher population densities, and they are also sites where more sophisticated forms of economic activity agg3lomerate. These findings are consistent with agglomeration effects that induce non-farm activities to coalesce in a particular location. Over time, we find that an increase in gold production is associated with more specialization, but not with a clear sectoral transformation of employment. We also find that the changes arising from increasing gold production are not reversed when large gold mines shrink. Rather, they continue to become more consistent with processes of structural transformation.","[Fafchamps, Marcel] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, BREAD & NBER, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Koelle, Michael] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Shilpi, Forhad] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Stanford University; University of Oxford; The World Bank,"Fafchamps, M (通讯作者)，Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Encina Hall,616 Serra St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",fafchamp@stanford.edu,"Shilpi, Forhad/AHD-9624-2022","Shilpi, Forhad/0000-0003-0112-8340",Knowledge for Change Program of the World Bank,Knowledge for Change Program of the World Bank,This research was funded by the Knowledge for Change Program of the World Bank.

A stochastic model is proposed to describe the dynamics to predict short-term stock price behaviors. Independent compound Poisson processes are introduced to describe the occurrences of market orders, limit orders and cancellations of limit orders, respectively. Based on highfrequency observations of the limit order book, the maximum empirical likelihood estimator (MELE) is applied to estimate the parameters of the compound Poisson processes. Moreover, an analytical formula is derived to compute the probability distribution of the first-passage time of a compound Poisson process. Based on this formula, the conditional probability of a price increase and the conditional distribution of the duration until the first change in mid-price are obtained. A novel approach of short-term stock price prediction is proposed and this methodology works reasonably well in the data analysis.

Using the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia's I-495 Express Lanes project as an example, the model measures infrastructure capital expenditure and tax shock effects and compares them with two public sector comparators (PSCs) representing lower-and upper-bound scenarios. The model also captures the impacts of capital accumulation and temporal variations during the 2008-2012 construction period. The simulation results show that by alleviating the regional economy's collected tax burden, P3s generate greater positive gross economic output and welfare impacts than traditional public financing models.","[Chen, Zhenhua] Ohio State Univ, City & Reg Planning, Knowlton Sch Architecture, 275 W Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Daito, Nobuhiko; Gifford, Jonathan L.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, 3351 Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; George Mason University,"Chen, ZH (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, City & Reg Planning, Knowlton Sch Architecture, 275 W Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",chen.7172@osu.edu,,,Virginia Department of Transportation,Virginia Department of Transportation,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Virginia Department of Transportation for supporting the research behind this study.

Such real-world repercussions-e.g., open defiance by public officials-can be more costly for the court than the benefit of hearing and deciding the case. In these situations the court may be better off not taking the case from the outset. This paper examines how courts deal with such cases when they can avoid adjudication-discretionary dockets. Using a stylized screening model, the paper examines the implications of such discretion. In particular, it shows that some undesired real-world outcomes are inevitable; and that broad control over their dockets should lead judges to take fewer cases in which the government is involved. Further, the paper discusses this logic from a comparative design perspective. The two prevalent models of judicial review, the American and the European, seem to take opposing stances on discretionary review; however, both narrow supreme courts' control over their dockets, either by directly limiting their discretionary jurisdiction or by decentralizing judicial review.","[Lavie, Shay] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Law, Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Lavie, S (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Law, Tel Aviv, Israel.",snlavie@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,49,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The proposed test improves the asymptotic power by using a more efficient estimator of the parameter being tested than that used in the literature. The estimator used by the standard version of the test depends on the individual predictions and realizations only through the observations on the prediction errors. However, the parameter being tested can also be expressed in terms of moments of the predictors and the predicted variable, some of which cannot be identified separately by the observations on the prediction errors alone. Parameterizing these moments in a GMM framework and drawing on the theory of West (1996), we devise more powerful versions of the test by exploiting a restriction that is maintained routinely under the null hypothesis by West (1996, Assumption 2b) and later studies. This restriction requires only finite second-order moments and covariance stationarity in order to ensure that the population linear projection exists. Simulation experiments show that the potential gains in power can be substantial. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Because collective bargaining impacts future compensation and player unions are always represented by current players and often represented by more experienced players, there is a much higher incentive to advocate for policies that increase pay for more experienced players. Conversely, policies that maintain monopsony power for leagues with regards to inexperienced players, such as player drafts, have remained in sports leagues.

The calculation of CO2 emissions and energy consumption reductions over the service lifetime of the infrastructure (60 years) shows that, even in the most optimistic scenarios considered, it would neither compensate the CO2 emissions linked to its construction and maintenance (2,71 MtCO(2)), nor would it contribute to net energy savings before 55 years of service. Robustness of these results leads us to conclude that GHG emissions reduction and energy savings should not be used as a general argument in favour of investing in high-speed rail infrastructure.

This question gained importance when the merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller became subject to a Phase II investigation by the Turkish Competition Authority in March 2016, which ultimately ended with an unconditional clearance decision, based on an intact beer market, recognizing that the relevant product market regarding beer brands in Turkey must be wider than the premium segment. To answer the research question above concerning relevant product market definition, we implement a Hypothetical Monopolist Test in two steps. In the first step, the aggregate price elasticity of demand for the premium segment is estimated econometrically by using a nested logit demand model. This model tests whether products in the same group are closer substitutes than products in different groups. We conclude that the correlation of beers within the same group is not statistically significant. Since the data in our study are obtained at the retail level, the price elasticity of demand at the brewer level is derived from the estimate at the retailer level by using very conservative assumptions with regard to the pass-through rates. In the second step, the hypothetical monopolist test is implemented by using the critical elasticity which is calculated by using the profit margins for the premium beer segment at brewer/supplier level under both 5 percent and 10 percent SSNIP. It is seen that the actual elasticity of demand for the premium segment is larger than the critical elasticity (in absolute value) under both scenarios. These findings show that the relevant product market regarding beer brands in Turkey must be wider than the premium segment.","[Gurkaynak, Gonenc; Kalkan, Ekrem] ELIG, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gurkaynak, Gonenc] Bilkent Univ, Fac Law, Ankara, Turkey",ELIG Attorneys at Law; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Gürkaynak, G (通讯作者)，ELIG, Istanbul, Turkey.;Gürkaynak, G (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Fac Law, Ankara, Turkey.",gonenc.gurkaynak@elig.com; ekrem.kalkan@elig.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The nascent literature on wildfire smoke costs has largely examined the indirect health costs associated with individuals' exposure to smoke. However, this ignores the direct costs of wildfire smoke, that is, the costs that smoke creates by directly affecting an individual's utility. Direct costs may arise from smoke-induced changes in visibility of scenic amenities or disruptions to ecosystem services that individuals see value in preserving. For the first time, the life satisfaction approach is applied to estimate wildfire smoke economic costs faced by individuals from direct and indirect sources. Using nationally-representative data from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System over 2006-2010, results suggest that US adults are willing to pay $373 [95% CI: $86.8, $659.2] to avoid one day of wildfire smoke over their county of residence within a six month period. Residents of rural areas are willing to pay $130 more to avoid one smoke day than urban residents. These results are higher than extant willingness to pay estimates of indirect smoke-induced health impacts, suggestive that the true costs of wildfire smoke are larger than previously estimated.

However, the laws have little impact on a number of other outcomes, including fertility, wages, and employment. This paper has two goals. First, using a North Carolina dataset which individually links birth certificate data to school administrative records, it more fully explores the opposite impacts on educational success than previous papers and investigates why students born after the cutoff date have lower educational attainment despite doing better in school. Second, it investigates the impact of school entry laws on teenage fertility and provides some evidence that test scores and years of education have negative impacts, but that these impacts offset each other in the case of school entry laws.","[Tan, Poh Lin] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469B Bukit Timah Rd,Lee Ka Shing Bldg 02-13, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Tan, PL (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469B Bukit Timah Rd,Lee Ka Shing Bldg 02-13, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",pt47@duke.edu,,"Tan, Poh Lin/0000-0002-4303-6041","Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore","Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","This project is supported by funding from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.

Concerned by the declining state of agricultural productivity in this region, we pursue the question whether agro-processing activities and exports of raw agricultural materials have a backward linkages effect on agricultural production activities. And if the relationship exists how can it be more effectively used? The regression results indicate that increases in export of raw agricultural materials negatively influence productivity growth in agriculture. Consistent with the findings of other studies that agro-industrial growth in the sub-Saharan region faces several challenges, the response of agricultural production to agro-industrial activities was positive but inelastic. To overcome these challenges, improving the value of agricultural exports and thereby improving agricultural productivity growth are needed in policy, regulatory, and institutional frameworks across countries in the region that will enable agro-industrial development to become stronger; lead to the creation of opportunities for increased private sector engagement including through the formation of public-private partnerships for developing synergies; provide access to credit for participants along the agricultural value chain; provide rural infrastructure that reduces postharvest losses and transport costs and shorten transit time, while increasing overall rural mobility; support innovations and technology for developing competitive value chains; provide access to value-responsive markets; provide access to timely information for improving bargaining powers; establish organizations to reduce transaction costs; and lead to inclusion of women, poor, and/or marginal groups in the value chains. Overall, this strategy will be optimal when it concomitantly and yearly increases agro-industrial activities and decreases agricultural raw material exports by 2.5% of their existing values, given 1981 as the base year.","[Akande, Olaide Rufai; Obekpa, Hephzibah Onyeje; Fani, Djomo-Raoul] Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Makurdi, Nigeria",,"Akande, OR (通讯作者)，Univ Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Makurdi, Nigeria.",akande.olaide@uam.edu.ng,"Obekpa, Hephzibah Onyeje/AAN-4681-2020","Obekpa, Hephzibah Onyeje/0000-0002-9320-6491; DJOMO CHOUMBOU, RAOUL FANI/0000-0003-3028-2558",,,,,35,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,311,330,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_14,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900014,0

It was hypothesized in the study that HEE and HEO had statistically significant positive impact on productivity in the selected sub-Saharan Africa countries over the stated period. Fixed effect Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) and a robust version of System Generalized Methods of Moment (SYSGMM) were adopted as model estimating techniques. Results from the LSDV model indicated that HEE had no statistically significant positive impact on productivity growth in the twenty-one SSA countries. This non-significance was corrected in the dynamic model, but with negative effects on the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP). The study further compared the worldwide technological frontier with those of the SSA countries under investigation and discovered that countries like Gabon, Mauritius and Swaziland ranked high, while Burundi needs to improve on its productivity determinants. The major conclusion of this study is therefore that higher education human capital should be supported with strong policy implementation, as this can have a positive impact on productivity growth.","[Bokana, Koye Gerry; Akinola, Gbenga Wilfred] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Law & Management Studies, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Akinola, GW (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Coll Law & Management Studies, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",bokanakg@ukzn.ac.za; 214585066@stu.ukzn.ac.za,"Akinola, Gbenga Wilfred/ABI-3595-2022; Bokana, Koye Gerry/Q-9685-2019","Akinola, Gbenga Wilfred/0000-0002-1630-8435; Bokana, Koye Gerry/0000-0001-5029-9416",,,,,33,7,7,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Authors analyze what information managers of public hospitals need for successful, balanced management. The aim is to explore issues of performance measurement as a basis for strategic business management of Croatian hospitals. Hospitals are under pressure to provide high quality services, while in the same time, they need to reduce costs, improve performance and increase customer satisfaction. Information on costs, prices and service fees, program goals, methods of measuring programs' performance, financial and non-financial performance indicators are therefore extremely important for strategic business management of hospitals. This paper analyzes the ways of measuring hospital's performance, the selection and definition of adequate performance indicators, and models of performance reports as a basis for business decisions making and the presentation of performance. Based on the analysis we propose performance report for one hospital in Croatia, a methodology of drafting the report as well as its use in decision-making process.","[Budimir, Verica] Polytech Pozega, Social Dept, Pozega, Croatia; [Lutilsky, Ivana Drazic; Dragija, Martina] Univ Zagreb, Dept Accounting, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Budimir, V (通讯作者)，Polytech Pozega, Social Dept, Pozega, Croatia.",vbudimir@vup.hr; idrazic@efzg.hr; mdragija@efzg.hr,"Dragija Kostic, Martina/H-9443-2018; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/I-2428-2018","Dragija Kostic, Martina/0000-0003-0131-0345; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/0000-0003-3562-9864",Croatian Science Foundation [8509],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation's funding of the project 8509 Accounting and financial reporting reform as a means for strengthening the development of efficient public sector financial management in Croatia.

Aid is associated with increased tax efforts, public spending, and lower domestic borrowings. Aid has contributed to improved fiscal performance in Rwanda, although the slow growth in tax revenue and regular aid shortfalls has prevented sustaining a balanced budget inclusive of aid. In terms of policy, continued efforts by donors to coordinate aid delivery systems, make aid more transparent, and support improvements in government fiscal statistics will all contribute to improving fiscal planning Recipients need to know how much aid is available to finance spending and how this is delivered, that is, whether through donor projects or government budgets.","[Bwire, Thomas] Bank Uganda, Kampala, Uganda; [Tamwesigire, Caleb] Univ Kigali, Kigali, Rwanda; [Munyankindi, Pascal] Natl Bank Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda",,"Bwire, T (通讯作者)，Bank Uganda, Kampala, Uganda.",tbwire@bou.or.ug; ctamwesigire@yahoo.com; pmunyankindi@bnr.rw,,,,,,,36,2,2,1,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE",2367-1033,,978-981-10-4451-9; 978-981-10-4450-2,FRONT AFR BUS RES,,,2017,,,,,,,79,101,,10.1007/978-981-10-4451-9_5,0.0,,,23,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432206900005,0

Dynamic changes in the economy have been initiated by globalization, which effects on strengthening competitive pressure in free market conditions. In such circumstances, from a regional point of view, there is a great challenge for local communities to preserve the regional identity in the historical, traditional, cultural and social values. Local communities - cities, villages, unfavorable inhabited places that have not found and realized opportunities for sustainable development are the conditions of uncertainty, uncertainties and potential loss of their own regional identity. Thus being said, their survival in the economic and territorial environment is questionable. Analysis results of previous researches have shown that local communities have the biggest contribution to regional development. They have an important role in preserving the value of local recognition on which it is possible to build a long-term regional development. Strengths and comparative advantages of the region can be found in indigenous products of food that are the basis for a strong position, based on the originality of the product. After identifying the type of local regional products, it is important to encourage the primary production, manufacturing, and to connect it all through gastronomic offer. Local communities that are identifying and developing indigenous products will be separated from the others and thus will affect their own economic development.

It is important to note that within the service sector, the hospitality sector involves a high degree of personal contact between hotel staff and customers, during which various misunderstandings can result in service failures. Therefore, instruments that enable learning about and solving problems emerging from customers now serve as one of the most important elements of the hospitality industry. In this context, the objective of answering the call for more studies investigating the effectiveness of recovery efforts and discovering their effects to perceived customer satisfaction, following a service recovery process, and customer behavior outcomes towards a hotel which had dropped the ball but later offered a solution. A structural equation model using a sample of 274 valid questionnaires, obtained from hotel establishment customers who had experienced failed service provisions and who had shown their discontent with these services, was used to examine these issues. The results confirm a significant and positive effect between the analyzed relations and also reinforce the importance of recovery efforts on satisfaction in service recovery and also determine the impact of that perceived satisfaction on behavioral outcomes of the affected consumers. Additionally, the empirical results show that communication and explanation are the dimensions of importance to consumers when they report a service failure to a service firm. Based on these results, this study recommends designing recovery process in such a way to get maximum advantage of this phenomenon. Therefore, organizations should offer dissatisfied customers with the option to choose among various recovery options.","[Diaz, Estrella; Martin-Consuegra, David] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Derecho & Ciencias Sociales, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Gomez, Mar; Molina, Arturo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Gomez, Mar; Martin-Consuegra, David; Molina, Arturo] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Empresari, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Díaz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Derecho & Ciencias Sociales, Ciudad Real, Spain.",estrella.diaz@uclm.es; mariamar.gomez@uclm.es; david.martin@uclm.es; arturo.molina@uclm.es,"Molina-Collado, Arturo/I-2655-2014; Gómez-Rico, Mar/C-2735-2017; Diaz, Estrella/E-9079-2015; Martín-Consuegra Navarro, David/I-2626-2014","Molina-Collado, Arturo/0000-0002-6537-2468; Gómez-Rico, Mar/0000-0002-7681-4794; Diaz, Estrella/0000-0002-3380-5847; Martín-Consuegra Navarro, David/0000-0003-4927-6289",,,,,65,4,5,1,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Coupled with an increasing competitiveness of the banking industry, this has emphasized the great importance of understanding consumers' choices of payment instruments. In order to meet their customers' expectations, banks have to understand what determines their choices of payment instruments. This study aims to uncover these determinants of payment instrument choice, through the use of cognitive mapping to structure the decision problem, and its combination with the Choquet integral to identify the overall preferred payment instrument from the user perspective. The results show that direct debits and electronic cards constitute the preferred payment instruments, and automated teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale (POS) the overall preferred transaction channels. Understanding consumers' choices of payment instrument, the factors underlying them and their interactions can contribute to better planning by banks at the distribution channel level. Strengths, limitations and managerial implications of our proposal are also discussed.","[Ferreira, Fernando A.

Increasingly, firms operating within design-intensive industries collaborate with external designers rather than undertaking this activity in-house. This raises some appropriability issues, as firms would need to reap the benefits of innovation originating across organisational boundaries. To address this gap, we carried out a multiple case study with firms and design consultants based in Italy across several manufacturing sectors. Our evidence suggests the presence of appropriability mechanisms that are specific to design innovation. Intellectual property rights, although not very effective, are employed to establish ownership in the market. Firms also use lead-time advantages, investment in specific assets and the quality of craftsmanship depending on the industry. Across most sectors, establishing long-term relationships inspired by knowledge sharing and trust constitutes a key mechanism firms adopt to appropriate the benefits attached to collaboration with external designers.","[Filippetti, Andrea] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Reg Studies ISSiRFA, Rome, Italy; [Filippetti, Andrea] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [D'Ippolito, Beatrice] Univ York, York Management Sch, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Filippetti, Andrea] Univ London, Birkbeck Ctr Innovat Management Res, London, England",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Studi sui Sistemi Regionali Federali e sulle Autonomie Massimo Severo Giannini (ISSIRFA-CNR); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of York - UK; University of London,"Filippetti, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Council CNR, Inst Reg Studies ISSiRFA, Rome, Italy.;Filippetti, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.;Filippetti, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, Birkbeck Ctr Innovat Management Res, London, England.",andrea.filippetti@cnr.it,"D'Ippolito, Beatrice/AAS-3936-2020","FILIPPETTI, ANDREA/0000-0002-1182-852X; D'Ippolito, Beatrice/0000-0003-0778-4373",,,,,52,28,29,7,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Therefore cooperation between education institutions, students and employers is essential for every country to create employable graduates. Introducing universities of applied sciences in Croatian high education system, lawmaker intended to offer to labour market more professionally skilled graduates in order to answer market need for more educated workers. However, implementation of new type of institution did not follow this intention, or positive European models such as Austrian or German Fachhochschulen. Based on present knowledge and experience the basic hypothesis is defined: Croatian labour market does not recognize professional high education as the labour market in Austria where some jobs require a degree from this type of study. This paper reviews employability of university of applied science graduates and their position in labour market. Review includes several database (OECD, Eurostat, Croatian Employment Office etc), and also empirical research on sample of 434 students and 49 members of high education institution management, conducted at 10 high education institutions.

Today, sport is the most money-spinning industry on the planet, which is exactly where all the skills of a competent manager come to light. It has become very difficult to be able to successfully sell a player, a club, a sports venue or a sports requisite, since everything is so easily accessible on the market at the moment. This means it takes superhuman abilities for a manager to present, and in the end sell, his or her product successfully. The managers' role defines the well-being of a sport or a sports organisation; it influences all aspects of sport, from professional to amateur, operating from its infrastructure to its development. Managerial positions in sport are very dynamic and comprise numerous activities directed towards reaching the goals set by a sports organisation. The activities consist of the basic elements of management, including forecasting, planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating and controlling. The aim of this paper is to discuss the functional role of management, that is, the role of managers as bearers of this function in various sports organisations.

Nowadays, new ways to develop tourism are being discovered. One of them is accessibility and social policy aspects. The aim of the paper is to map the possibilities for people with physical disabilities to participate in tourism in the Czech Republic. Following the aim, the article hypothesizes the existence of an interdependence between the number of visitors and the number of accessible accommodation establishments. At the same time, a hypothesis forms that in regions with a higher share of accommodation establishments of classes (star star star star) (First Class) and (star star star star star) (Luxury) there will be a higher number of barrier-free accommodation establishments available. It assesses the situation in all administrative regions while focusing on coverage of the territory with the capacity of accommodation establishments and restaurant & catering facilities, on the existence of accessible educational trails, tourist routes, and cycle routes. The article is also interested in possibilities to visit UNESCO world heritage sites. On the basis of the conducted analysis, it is possible to conclude that the situation in the Czech Republic in the area of accessible tourism is not particularly positive. The average share of barrier-free accommodation establishments in the country is 11% and 12% in restaurant & catering establishments. The most accessible routes, cycle routes, etc., are found in regions with national parks or attractive natural sites, such as Cesky raj, Krkonose, Sumava, and Ceske Svycarsko. The situation in the Czech Republic in the area of providing disabled people with tourism services is improving in comparison with the past.","[Linderova, Ivica] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Travel & Tourism, Jihlava, Czech Republic; [Janecek, Petr] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Linderová, I (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Travel & Tourism, Jihlava, Czech Republic.",ivica.linderova@vspj.cz; janecp00@kmo.zcu.cz,"Janeček, Petr/L-4794-2019; Linderova, Ivica/AAK-2161-2021","Janeček, Petr/0000-0003-3437-8012; Linderova, Ivica/0000-0003-1080-1082",[SGS-2017-007],,"This article was processed with a contribution from project SGS-2017-007 Business environment as a factor of regional development by the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia.",,28,13,13,4,38,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Starting from the analysis of an existing flood-damage model developed in other contexts, we propose an integrated evaluation model based on the definition of an analytic stage damage curve for different typology of residential buildings. The model is based on the integration of hydraulic model, combined with an ex-ante damage evaluation model, as a decision-support tool for sustainable risk management. Finally, combining hazard and vulnerability levels by using a GIS-based toolbox, the EAD to an urban area is obtained. The proposed model is then tested in a residential urban area of the municipality of Olbia in Italy, which was damaged by the extraordinary flood on November 2013. The comparison, between the ex-post assessed damage and the ex-ante evaluation based on the application of the model, enables to verify high reliability of the results obtained.","[Mancini, Marco; Lombardi, Gabriele] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Piazzale Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan, Italy; [Mattia, Sergio; Oppio, Alessandra] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, Via Bonardi 3, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Torrieri, Francesca] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Piazzale Tecchio 2, Naples, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Naples Federico II,"Torrieri, F (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Piazzale Tecchio 2, Naples, Italy.",francesca.torrieri@unina.it,"Torrieri, Francesca/I-9279-2012","Torrieri, Francesca/0000-0002-4879-1919",,,,,23,3,3,1,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,157,170,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_12,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600012,0

Bear in mind that the construction of a wind farm requires the acquisition (through expropriation, or amicable agreement of the surface rights) of at least the land that must be transformed for the realization of the windmill support, while other land could be encumbered with easements. Areas identified by the ground projection of the blades are, in fact, affected by overflight easements, and all transport infrastructures linked to the wind farm generate easements (underground conduits or power lines). The issue involves many aspects and takes place in a changing regulatory framework. The case law, in relation to the frequency of cases (expropriation is certainly much more frequent than easements), has developed a well-established approach that makes specific reference to the expropriation of the entire property and not merely of the right of fruition. If one pays attention to urban planning, there is a profound difference between the two cases. In the case of easement, unlike expropriation, the procedure does not require a change in the urban destination of land. A land intended for agricultural use remains as such even if it houses a plant for the production of alternative energy. This, without a thorough analysis of the principles that underlie the decisions of the judges, could also lead to profound inequality in terms of compensation payments. The issue is therefore considered by trying to transfer those principles already established with regard to the expropriation of property, even in the case of easements, where in both cases the beneficiary is a private individual, who by virtue of the possession of land, reaps a profit.","[Manganelli, Benedetto] Univ Basilicata, Sch Engn, Via Ateneo Lucano 10, I-85100 Potenza, Italy",University of Basilicata,"Manganelli, B (通讯作者)，Univ Basilicata, Sch Engn, Via Ateneo Lucano 10, I-85100 Potenza, Italy.",benedetto.manganelli@unibas.it,"Manganelli, Benedetto/P-6000-2014","Manganelli, Benedetto/0000-0002-3632-6358",,,,,19,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-3529,,978-3-319-49676-4; 978-3-319-49675-7,GREEN ENERGY TECHNOL,,,2017,,,,,,,267,276,,10.1007/978-3-319-49676-4_20,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI6HB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413289600020,0

Second, it identifies the human resource requirement, which is required for achieving those learning events or innovations. Third, it maps out the internal and external human resource development strategies employed by the firms. The three issues are analysed in the context of three leading domestic firms in India's automotive industry. The ensuing analysis shows some remarkable parallels in the internal and external strategies adopted by the three firms. The most dominant internal strategy is in-house training of scientists and engineers to do in-house R&D and the most dominant external strategy is the acquisition of technologically intensive foreign firms which possess a key technology which the original firm lacks and then effecting knowledge flows from the acquired foreign firm to the original domestic firm.","[Mani, Sunil] Ctr Dev Studies, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India",,"Mani, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Dev Studies, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.",mani@cds.edu,,"Mani, Sunil/0000-0001-6929-2556",,,,,2,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

While entrepreneurial acquisitions are increasingly deployed by SMEs, little is known about their antecedents, motivational drivers and organisational outcomes. Drawing on detailed case study evidence from Scotland, the key factor found to be driving these acquisitions was the desire to augment and exploit technological complementarities between the acquiring and acquired firms. Acquisition can therefore be conceptualised as an advanced stage of the outside-in 'open innovation' strategies proactively used within these innovative SMEs. Firms executing this strategy typically have an acute propensity for risk, a desire for close customer engagement, effective business models and strong external orientation. The work suggests that greater attention should be paid within M&A theory to the dynamics of these types of smaller scale entrepreneurial acquisitions.","[Mawson, Suzanne] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling, Scotland; [Brown, Ross] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of Stirling; University of St Andrews,"Mawson, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling, Scotland.",Suzanne.Mawson@stir.ac.uk,"Mawson, Suzanne/Z-1294-2019","Brown, Ross/0000-0002-6164-7639; Mawson, Suzanne/0000-0003-1983-514X",,,,,84,19,26,4,103,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

It is based on two research hypotheses. The first one is that the competitiveness of national economy significantly depends on the level of FDI. The second hypothesis is that the transition to a market economy approach in the period of 2007-2015 has reflected on the increased inflow of FDI, improving the ranking of Montenegro in the competitiveness reports issued by the World Economic Forum. The authors have placed their research focus on a theoretical analysis of the impact of FDI on the level of national competitiveness, as well as on an in-depth analysis of the ranking of Montenegro in the competitiveness reports. According to the authors, the transition in Montenegro has been hampered for years, by a number of factors. However, at the beginning of the new millennium, market economy based on the rule of law and stable institutions has started to be built irrevocably. All of the above has affected the inflow of FBI and increased the level of competitiveness of the national economy. Hence, the paper aims to identify the extent to which FDI inflow in the observed period influenced the ranking of Montenegro in the competitiveness reports of the World Economic Forum.","[Milovic, Nikola; Jocovic, Mijat] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro",University of Montenegro,"Milovic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Jovana Tomasevica 37, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro.",nmilovic@ac.me; mijatj@ac.me,"Jocović, Mijat/HNC-3764-2023",,,,,,45,8,8,0,5,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Taking into account the general purpose properties of these technologies, and referring to recombinant innovation theories, we argue that KETs knowledge could attenuate the effect that regional branching ascribes to technological relatedness, giving regions more scope for their technological diversification strategies. Furthermore, we claim that regions could benefit from this KETs effect, even if they are followers in their development, thanks to interregional spillovers from closer KETs leaders. Combining regional patent and economic data from a thirty-year panel (1980-2010) of twenty-six European countries, we actually find that KETs negatively moderate the role of technological relatedness for regional specialization in new technological fields, captured by a revealed technology advantage index. KETs knowledge also increases the number of new technological specializations. This positive effect more than compensates the previous negative moderation effect, so that the net impact of KETs on regional branching is positive. Supportive evidence is also found for KETs cross-regional spillovers. Overall, the results provide scientific support for the recent European Commission recommendation to plug KETs into the policy toolbox for smart specialization strategies inspired by regional branching.","[Montresor, Sandro] Kore Univ Enna, Dept Econ & Law, I-94100 Enna, EN, Italy; [Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti Martiis, I-100128 Turin, TO, Italy; [Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Turin, I-100128 Turin, TO, Italy",Universita Kore di ENNA; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Turin,"Montresor, S (通讯作者)，Kore Univ Enna, Dept Econ & Law, I-94100 Enna, EN, Italy.",sandro.montresor@unikore.it; francesco.quatraro@unito.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019; Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239; montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X",Collegio Carlo Alberto,Collegio Carlo Alberto,"The authors wish to thank attendees and discussants at these events for insightful comments that contributed to improving the quality of the article.

The service sector is a bridge between input factors and output factors to the process of commodity production and product consumption. The appearance and development of the services have helped to overcome geographic obstacles, hasten the rate of commodity circulation, impulse needs of commodity transaction from one country to the other country and from one geographic region to another geographic region. This paper is researched some urban service sector development conditions. In order to develop service sector, the first principle is to recognize the importance the services as accelerator to the growth of the industrial and also agricultural sectors. In other hand, service sector itself is important component of the whole economy as its share in GDP has always increased. The average growth rate of the key services such as transport, communication, finance and insurance is often above the growth rate of the whole economy. To achieve fast grow of the service sectors, it is required to have the policy planning mechanisms so that all of the functional sectors and divisions in different ministries and the city municipals had coordinated synchronously and implemented the development strategies of the service sector. Related stakeholders have to contribute to the master plan of the city service sector development.","[Nguyen Nguyen Phong] HCM City Univ Culture, Fac Tourism, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",,"Nguyen, NP (通讯作者)，HCM City Univ Culture, Fac Tourism, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",nguyenphongcl@gmail.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",2287-478X,,,INT CONF KOREA DISTR,,,2017,,,,,,,223,224,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ1UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418104000059,0

The main aim of this paper is an empirical analysis of market liquidity dimensions on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). We investigate market depth and market tightness for the 53 WSE-listed companies divided into three size groups. The high-frequency data covers the period from January 3, 2005 to June 30, 2015. The additional goal is robustness analysis of the results obtained with respect to the whole sample period and three adjacent subsamples of equal size: the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods. The order ratio (OR) is employed as a proxy of market depth, while market tightness is approximated using the relative spread (RS). In line with the expectations, the empirical results indicate that the OR values rather do not depend on firm size, while the RS estimates are slightly higher for small companies. Moreover, the results turn out to be robust to the choice of the sample. Furthermore, an initial research concerning interaction between liquidity dimensions on the WSE is provided by analyzing the degree of correlation between market depth and market tightness. In general, the correlation results are consistent with the literature. The majority of correlation coefficients between daily estimates of the order ratio and the relative spread indicators are not significantly different from zero.","[Olbrys, Joanna; Mursztyn, Michal] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Olbrys, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",j.olbrys@pb.edu.pl; m.mursztyn@pb.edu.pl,"Olbrys, Joanna/P-8237-2018","Olbrys, Joanna/0000-0002-0928-0040",Bialystok University of Technology [S/WI/1/2014],Bialystok University of Technology,The present study was supported by a grant S/WI/1/2014 from Bialystok University of Technology and founded from the resources for research by Ministry of Science and Higher Education.,,44,9,9,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,151,166,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_12,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400012,0

The results indicate that: (1) a more comprehensive definition is necessary, which combines the two dimensions of technological diversification (breadth and depth), which are positively linked to firm performance; (2) in low-tech firms, technological diversification serves as a higher-level capability resulting in higher performance; however, in high-tech firms, technological diversification serves as a zero-level capability that does not contribute to firm performance and (3) intangible complementary assets negatively moderate the relationship between technological diversification and performance. Further research should consider the two dimensions to reach a more comprehensive understanding of technological diversification. Firms should increase both the depth and breadth of their technological diversification to enhance performance.","[Pan, Xin] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg, London, England; [Ning, Lutao] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Int Business, Francis Bancroft Bldg, London, England; [Chen, Xuanjin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Tsinghua University,"Chen, XJ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",chenxj.15@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Ning, Lutao/0000-0002-9620-0554; /0000-0002-0974-0748",,,,,81,6,6,6,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We propose an analytical framework for examining the role of alliance governance on alliance performance with moderating and mediating effects. We obtain 205 survey responses from Korean firms that have experienced technology alliances. Empirical findings show that the relationship between alliance governance and alliance performance is moderated by knowledge acquisition. A contractual governance has a greater influence on explicit knowledge acquisition than tacit knowledge acquisition. On the other hand, relational governance is more closely related to tacit knowledge than to explicit knowledge. The influence of the interaction between relational governance and contractual governance on the performance appears to be negative.","[Park, Young-Chan] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Ctr Technol Innovat Management, Cheonan Si, South Korea; [Kim, Byung-Keun] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Ind Management, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongnam, South Korea; [Lee, Saerom] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Management Res, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education; Korea University of Technology & Education; Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, BK (通讯作者)，Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Ind Management, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongnam, South Korea.",b.kim@koreatech.ac.kr,,"Kim, Byung-Keun/0000-0002-6238-0569",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859]; Graduate School Research Program of KOREATECH,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Graduate School Research Program of KOREATECH,This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859] and by the Graduate School Research Program of KOREATECH [2017].,,94,7,7,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The investigation is conducted in the form of a survey, with the data being gathered via questionnaires handed out to Farabank's managers and Mellat bank's customers. Several univariate statistics are implemented synthesize the answers relative to the research focused questions. The initial results revealed that the CSR implementation in Farabank is significantly higher than average weighted score of 4, and enabled the finding that customers have greater expectations compared to bank's actual CSR plan. However, among the five dimensions of CSR, the CSRs that addressed the responsibilities toward customers and community turned out as the top most priorities for both customers and managers in bank. Thereafter, the general CSR, employees, and finally shareholder dimensions are placed as the next priorities for customers, while, this is shareholders, employees, and at last general CSR for bank.","[Saeidi, Isayedeh Parastoo; Othman, Mohd Shahwahid Haji] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Saaeidi, Seyyed Alireza] Kharazmi Univ, Dept Management, 43 South Mofatteh Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Saeidi, Parvaneh] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Mardani, Abbas] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Management, Skudai 81310, Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Vilnius University; Kharazmi University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Saeidi, IP (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",pari.saeidi@gmail.com; mohdshahwahid@gmail.com; dalia.streimikiene@khf.vu.lt; saaeidi@gmail.com; parvaneh.saeidi81@gmail.com; mabbas3@live.utm.my,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Saeidi, Parvaneh/HJZ-4373-2023; Saeidi, Sayedeh Parastoo/HSE-5411-2023","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; Saeidi, Parvaneh/0000-0002-9743-9372;",,,,,64,3,3,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In particular we focus on information provided by firms on their processes and products. We find that even if transparency is not of direct importance to the courts, that is, is not informative as to findings of product defectiveness in a given case, the Law, in order to improve the incentives for the firm to provide the desired level of product quality, should optimally set product liability standards as a function of a firm's transparency level. Courts should be more lenient (in terms of evidence showing that the manufacturer is not liable) with those firms who have been more transparent in terms of product features and manufacturing information. Our result is reinforced when transparency reduces evidentiary uncertainty before the courts. This has implications for the interplay between market forces and product liability.

The study reported in this paper employed an activity-based approach to investigate drivers' responses to two distance-based TDC scenarios. Three hundred and eight Dutch frequent car commuters participated in an online stated adaptation experiment in which they recorded their car use for 7 days and, in response to the TDC scenarios, had the opportunity to reorganise their car use pattern, if desired. This paper investigates adaptation behaviours at the trip level. The results show that approximately 30% of trips made for maintenance and leisure-oriented activities were subject to change. In cases of change, a travel mode change was the most preferred adaptation strategy. A mixed logit modelling framework is used to test the effect of a variety of activity/trip attributes, TDC scenario attributes, and individual characteristics on the preference for adaptation alternatives.","[Dogterom, Nico; Ettema, Dick; Dijst, Martin] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Dogterom, N (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",nicodogterom@gmail.com; D.F.Ettema@uu.nl; M.J.Dijst@uu.nl,"Ettema, Dick/IQS-9627-2023; Dijst, Martin/ABF-5649-2021","Dijst, Martin/0000-0002-7666-3455",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [435-12-212],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This research was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (grant no. 435-12-212), through the research programme 'The Application of Operations Research in Urban Transport'.

Certification schemes denote steering mechanisms that allow enterprises to voluntarily adhere to a set of verifiable principles. While certification has global aspirations, its uptake and growth are heterogeneous across different countries. Yet, few studies empirically analyze such variation. We address this gap by focusing on the Forest Stewardship Council, a major sustainable forestry management certification program. We empirically evaluate uptake and growth across 151 countries and hypothesize that market and socio-political characteristics explain variation in uptake and growth. We find that a value-added wood industry, state-control of the forestry industry and competing certification programs, contrary to the literature, are key drivers.","[van der Loos, Hendrik Z.

This suggests that either there is a preference for same-occupation matches or that search costs are lower within occupation. This paper uses 2008-2015 data from the American Community Survey to analyze same-occupation matching among a sample of recently married couples. Our empirical strategy compares the difference in wages between same-occupation husbands and different-occupation husbands across occupations with different percent male workers. Under a preference explanation, this difference should become less negative as the share of males in the occupation increases. Under a search cost explanation, this difference should become more negative as the share of males increases. Our results are consistent with the search cost explanation. Furthermore, using an occupation-specific index of workplace communication, we demonstrate that the results are most consistent with the search cost mechanism for occupations with a greater degree of workplace communication. Finally, we show that matching on field of degree for couples in which both spouses have a college degree is also consistent with the search cost explanation.","[Mansour, Hani] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Campus Box 181, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Mansour, Hani; McKinnish, Terra] IZA, Campus Box 181, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [McKinnish, Terra] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"McKinnish, T (通讯作者)，IZA, Campus Box 181, Denver, CO 80217 USA.;McKinnish, T (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",hani.mansour@ucdenver.edu; terra.mckinnish@colorado.edu,,,,,,,41,15,20,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Each of these domains may require the analysis of different kinds of inputs and special considerations. Even within a given domain, such as retail, there may be many similar use cases of the same kind of forecast, which can lead to practitioners making different decisions. This paper discusses several of the important decision points that practitioners must work through and uses item-level sales forecasting in the retail domain as leveraged by pricing and inventory management as examples of the different paths that may be taken. It considers how each use can lead to a different forecasting objective, and a corresponding focus on different error metrics. In addition, there are several tradeoffs in the forecasting methods that are used to meet each of the objectives best, including the kinds of models used, the running time speed, and forecast accuracy requirements.

However, taking into account the complex nature of the road safety framework, a multidimensional approach may be advisable in which all agents involved in the decision making process are properly represented. This article provides two multidimensional safety indicators that combine a set of criteria related to economics, demographics and sustainable urban transportation to assess urban road safety performance in 50 Spanish provinces (NUTS-3 regions). Multicriteria Decision Making Analysis (MDMA) is used to determine the set of factors that should be prioritized to minimize urban traffic accidents and fatalities. Using an objective weighting method for the chosen criteria, the obtained results point to aspects associated with the degree of urban development being the most important factors in discriminating and ranking the alternatives (provinces). Consequently, elements such as higher urban population and services concentration, and more advanced both transport systems and roads network, are related to safer urban areas. The two proposed safety indexes can provide policymakers with a useful tool for decision making in the area of urban road safety by identifying key attributes that should be promoted in urban planning.","[Castro-Nuno, Mercedes] Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Avda Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain; [Teresa Arevalo-Quijada, M.] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ 3, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Castro-Nuño, M (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Avda Ramon y Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",mercas@us.es; arevalo@us.es,"Castro-Nuño, Mercedes/I-2623-2015","Castro-Nuño, Mercedes/0000-0002-7015-0042",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-64996-P]; European Regional Development Fund [ECO2015-64996-P]; [SPIP2015-1702],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU));,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Spanish General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) for the human and economic resources made available to undertake this study, which was conducted as part of a research project funded by grant ref. no.

Three focus groups were held in Valencia and two in Granada with participants who undertook, at least once a week, one short non-shopping trip in any travel mode (were short trip is defined as less than 30-45 min walking distance). A thematic analysis of the data using the software QSR NVivo was performed after the transcription of the video recordings. Results show that participants perceive more facilitators to walking in Granada than in Valencia, explained by the smaller size of the former city and the driving restriction policy in the city centre of Granada for private cars. The main common barriers to walking in the two cities were: insecurity from crime (absence of people, a poor street lighting or walking along a conflictive area), a high density of traffic lights and walking along large avenues. In the city of Valencia, crossing multi-lane avenues and large-diameter roundabouts are deterrents to walking. In Granada, very steep streets motivate the use of alternative travel modes.","[Ferrer, Sheila; Ruiz, Tomas] Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Transport Dept, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Ferrer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Transport Dept, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",shferlo@upv.es; truizsa@tra.upv.es,"Ruiz, Tomas/G-3246-2014","Ruiz, Tomas/0000-0002-6943-0725",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PEATON-TRA2011-27415],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation for funding the research project PEATON-TRA2011-27415.

However, previous literature regarding spatiotemporal behaviour has, above all, focused on individual characteristics detached from their immediate social contexts. By adopting a relational perspective this paper aims to explore how the combination of individual and household-related variables can exert different mobilities in a Mediterranean metropolis such as Barcelona. Based on travel times and trip purposes reported in a traditional travel survey, both gender and social status are first confirmed as significant factors shaping daily mobility. Second, the relationships in the household emerge as relevant as individual characteristics when understanding one's everyday mobility patterns. In particular, the presence of children is regarded as a clear spatiotemporal constrictor, which is especially acute for women.","[Delclos-Alio, Xavier; Miralles-Guasch, Carme] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Grp Estudis Mobilitat Transport & Terr GEMOTT, Dept Geog, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Miralles-Guasch, Carme] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Edifici ICTA ICP,Campus Bellaterra, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Delclòs-Alió, X (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Grp Estudis Mobilitat Transport & Terr GEMOTT, Dept Geog, Edifici B,Campus Bellaterra, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",xavier.delclos@uab.cat; carme.miralles@uab.cat,"Miralles-Guasch, Carme/M-6156-2015; Delclòs-Alió, Xavier/X-7513-2019","Delclòs-Alió, Xavier/0000-0002-7206-2310","Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte, Gobierno de Espana [FPU14/02638]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana [CSO2016-74904-R]","Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte, Gobierno de Espana; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana","The research presented in this paper has been possible thanks to financial support received from the FPU14/02638 grant (Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte, Gobierno de Espana) and from the Project CSO2016-74904-R (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana).

It offers an original perspective on the governance of Public Transport (PT), buses in particular, and how it contributes to Quality and Performance that is the modal shift. To this purpose, the paper departs from the premise that traditional public management concepts, tools, and techniques are limited in practice, as they do not account for the context and subsequent complexities. This refers to the New Public Management (NPM) paradigm, which promotes competition for service delivery in order to foster efficiency, as well as contracting and distinct responsibilities between the Public Transport Authority (PTA) and the Public Transport Operator (PTO). Yet such a rationale is static in nature and overemphasises structures over processes. New Public Management does not capture the uncertainties of the dynamic and changing environment, nor the customer-led nature of Quality and Performance. Instead, this paper contends that modal shift depends on the capacity of multiple parties to build the future together and requires the creation of conditions for joint action and partnership. To better reflect such a standpoint, modal shift relies on recent developments from Governance and Network theories, combined with the constructs of Contract Theories to analyse the empirical materials.","[Fabianski, Caroline] UITP Int Union Publ Transport, 6 Rue St Marie, B-1080 Brussels, Belgium",,"Fabianski, C (通讯作者)，UITP Int Union Publ Transport, 6 Rue St Marie, B-1080 Brussels, Belgium.",caroline.fabianski@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

All stages of the contracting-out life cycle were considered, including design, procurement and management. A focus was placed on assessing key performance indicators and critical success factors and relating these to governance issues, both formal and informal. In particular, the extent to which concepts such as institutional maturity, soft competition and transaction costs could provide new insights was examined. The key finding was that contracting-out critical success factors are highly context specific.

From its inception, the New Alameda Providencia BRT corridor (NAP) has attempted to transform a transport project into a highly valued public space in Metropolitan Santiago. In the regional capital of Temuco-Padre Las Casas, innovative participation in Temuco Te Mueve Public Transport Plan was designed to build consensuses and permanent citizen-government collaboration. These experiences underline the need to pay more attention to both process and institutions for sustainability. They also suggest strategies for transitions, even where governance arrangements are particularly complex.","[Sagaris, Lake] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable CEDEUS, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, BRT Ctr Excellence, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Sagaris, L (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable CEDEUS, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, BRT Ctr Excellence, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",lsagaris@uc.cl,"Sagaris, Lake/A-7717-2018","Sagaris, Lake/0000-0002-9162-5190","BRT Center for Excellence; Centro de Estudios de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS) at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Conicyt, FONDAP [15110020]","BRT Center for Excellence; Centro de Estudios de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS) at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Conicyt, FONDAP(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP)","We thank the Thredbo conference series, particularly Workshop 4 leaders Tom Rye and Karolina Isaakson.

However, little is known about whether medical cannabis is being used clinically to any significant degree. Using data on all prescriptions filled by Medicare Part D enrollees in the United States from 2010 to 2015, we find that the use of prescription drugs for which cannabis could serve as a clinical alternative fell significantly once a medical cannabis law (MCL) was put in place. Overall savings to the Medicare program when states implement MCLs are estimated to have been as much as $638.8 million per year by 2015. Counterfactually, if all states had adopted dispensary-based MCLs by 2015, we estimate that programmatic savings would have been between $1.4 and $1.7 billion.

As in many network technology adoption decisions, hospitals face countervailing incentives to coordinate or differentiate in their choice of vendors. We find evidence of substantial agglomeration on EMR vendors, which increases as hospital markets become more competitive. These findings suggest that incentives to coordinate dominate incentives to differentiate overall, and the relative balance grows stronger in favor of coordination as markets become more competitive. Our findings also have important implications regarding antitrust policy.

The approach is based on quantitative and qualitative sources of information: the Spanish Household Budget Survey and in-depth interviews with public transport policy makers from six metropolitan areas. Transport is one of the household expenditure items that is the most affected by the crisis. The average amount spent on transport fell to its lowest value in 2013, dropping by 37% in six years. The proportion of budget spent on transport was reduced by a majority of households, whatever the residential location or purchasing power, with the exception of the poorest. Households reacted promptly to the crisis by reducing their purchases of new cars; their spending on transport use was affected less significantly. Poor households or those living in low-density areas were least able to reduce their transport costs. To cope with the crisis, public transport authorities reduced transport supply and increased fares. They also implemented other measures to bring in extra income which had no impact on transport services. The research concludes that sustainability-oriented transport policies promoting public transport and the reduction of car dependency, together with sustainable land-use policies, may help to limit the household transport budget and the impacts of an economic crisis on mobility.","[Cascajo, Rocio; Monzon, Andres] Univ Politecn Madrid, TRANSyT, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, C Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Olvera, Lourdes Diaz; Plat, Didier] Univ Lyon, LAET, ENTPE, Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France; [Ray, Jean-Baptiste] Arcadis Movicite, 127 Blvd Stalingrad, F-69626 Villeurbanne, France",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Olvera, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, LAET, ENTPE, Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France.",rocio.cascajo@upm.es; lourdes.diaz-olvera@entpe.fr; andres.monzon@upm.es; didier.plat@entpe.fr; jeanbaptiste.ray@arcadis.com,"Monzón, Andrés/M-3803-2017; Cascajo, Rocio/K-5855-2017","Cascajo, Rocio/0000-0002-9962-4475",R&D French Transport Programme PREDIT; EPSRC [EP/K011723/1] Funding Source: UKRI,R&D French Transport Programme PREDIT; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The content of this paper is partially based on the findings of the research project CIME (The Crisis and its Impacts on Mobility in Spain.

Of particular importance in many areas is the possibility of forecasting the tail-dependences explicitly. Most of the available approaches are only able to estimate tail-dependences and correlations via nuisance parameters, and cannot be used for either interpretation or forecasting. We propose a general Bayesian approach for modeling and forecasting tail-dependences and correlations as explicit functions of covariates, with the aim of improving the copula forecasting performance. The proposed covariate-dependent copula model also allows for Bayesian variable selection from among the covariates of the marginal models, as well as the copula density. The copulas that we study include the Joe-Clayton copula, the Clayton copula, the Gumbel copula and the Student's t-copula. Posterior inference is carried out using an efficient MCMC simulation method. Our approach is applied to both simulated data and the S&P 100 and S&P 600 stock indices. The forecasting performance of the proposed approach is compared with those of other modeling strategies based on log predictive scores. A value-at-risk evaluation is also performed for the model comparisons. (C) 2018 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper focuses on probably the most important one, suppliers to a downstream sellers' cartel. The paper first identifies three economic effects that determine whether suppliers suffer losses due to a cartel by their customers. We then examine whether suppliers are entitled to claim net losses as damages in the U.S. and the EU, with exemplary looks at England and Germany, delineating the boundaries of the right to damages in the two leading competition law jurisdictions. We find that, while the majority view in the U.S. denies standing, the emerging position in the EU approves of cartel supplier damage claims. We show that this is consistent with the ECJ case law and in line with the new EU Damages Directive. From a comparative law and economics perspective, we argue that more generous supplier standing in the EU compared to the U.S. is justified in view of the different institutional context and the goals assigned to the right to damages in the EU. We demonstrate that supplier damage claims are also practically viable by showing how supplier damages can be estimated econometrically.","[Bueren, Eckart] Max Planck Inst Comparat & Int Private Law, Mittelweg 187, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Smuda, Florian] German Fed Cartel Off Bundeskartellamt, Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Bueren, E (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Comparat & Int Private Law, Mittelweg 187, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",bueren@mpipriv.de; florian.smuda@gmail.com,,,Max Planck Society,Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society),Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.,,122,2,2,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

An incumbent NGO may strategically narrow the breadth of its label to deter entry of competing schemes, reducing welfare. Even when entry is accommodated, welfare is compromised.

This integration led to objections that Google was engaging in search bias, and thus foreclosing specialized search rivals to the detriment of competition and consumers.

Four approaches to funding are outlined from fully government to fully private with two in between. The Entrepreneur Rail Model suggests a majority private sector funding can facilitate the new markets for urban regeneration as well as providing integrated rail that government's usually find difficult to fund. The process requires transit planning to be seen primarily as a land development tool rather than a transport system.

A feature of this Act was the introduction of business rescue legislation. Although this legislation was implemented in May 2011, statistics indicate that the success rate for business rescues is approximately only 12%. This low success rate prompted debate relating to the effectiveness, and continued suitability of a legislated business rescue as a mechanism to rehabilitate financially distressed companies. A feature of the business rescue environment in South Africa is the lack of knowledge, necessitating more research in the field. Aim: Due to the importance of the business rescue practitioner in the overall success of a rescue, the research focused on establishing competencies required to be a successful practitioner. Setting: The research was undertaken in South Africa between 2015 and 2017. Methods: A mixed methods research approach was utilised to identify the important competencies of a successful practitioner. A survey was conducted with the membership of the Turnaround Management Association of Southern Africa. The survey was mailed to 130 members and the response rate was 54%. The survey was complemented by undertaking interviews with 7 of the top 10 business rescue practitioners, according to their number of practitioner appointments. Results: The original contribution to knowledge of this study is the identification of a set of competencies that can be utilised to accredit business rescue practitioners and the emphasis on an accounting qualification and effective cash management skills that a successful practitioner must possess. Conclusion: The knowledge generated from this research will benefit business rescue practitioners, the financial sector and stakeholders of companies intending to go into a legislated business rehabilitation.","[Rajaram, Rajendra; Singh, Anesh M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Commerce, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Rajaram, R (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Commerce, Durban, South Africa.",rajaramr@ukzn.ac.za,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,3,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This paper revisits news shocks to identify the role of different vintages of total factor productivity (TFP) series and term structure of interest rates as major prognosticators of future economic growth. There is a growing strand of literature regarding the use of utilization-adjusted TFP series, provided by Fernald (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Working Paper Series, 2014) for identification of news shocks. We reestimate Barsky and Sims' (Journal of Monetary Economics, 2011, 58, 273-289) empirical analysis by employing 2007 and 2015 vintages of TFP data. We find substantial quantitative as well as qualitative differences among impulse response functions when using 2007 and 2015 vintages of TFP data. Output and hours initially decline, followed by quick reversal of both variables. In sharp contrast to results achieved by the 2007 vintage of TFP data, results achieved by the 2015 vintage of TFP data depict that output and hours will increase in response to positive TFP shock. By including term structure data in our VAR specification, total surprise technology shock and news shock account for 97% and 92% of the forecast error variance in total TFP and total output respectively. We find that revisions in TFP series over time ultimately impact the conclusion regarding news shocks on business cycles. Our results support the notion that term structure data help in better identification of news shock as compared to other forward-looking variables.","[Chen, Zhang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Dept Accounting, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wagan, Zulfiqar Ali] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Seelro, Hakimzadi] Sindh Agr Univ Tando Jam, Fac Social Sci, Tandojam, Pakistan",Hefei University of Technology; Hefei University of Technology; Sindh Agricultural University,"Wagan, ZA (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zulfiqarsch@hotmail.com,"Wagan, Zulfiqar Ali/O-6359-2019","Wagan, Zulfiqar Ali/0000-0002-7178-6042",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373065],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 71373065",,48,0,1,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

We perform factor and cluster analyses in order to identify major factors which differentiate and create clusters in the set of 79 Slovak local administrative unit (LAU-1) districts from the view point of above-replacement fertility levels. Using the transversal and cohort approaches, another aim is to identify major specificities of Romany reproduction and the range of lag behind the majority population in terms of demographic transition. The concept of high fertility trap' is presented in this respect.","[Sprocha, Branislav] SAS, Demog Res Ctr, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Sprocha, Branislav] SAS, Ctr Social & Psychol Sci, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Bleha, Branislav] Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences; SAS Institute Inc; SAS Institute Inc; Slovak Academy of Sciences; Comenius University Bratislava,"Sprocha, B (通讯作者)，SAS, Demog Res Ctr, Bratislava, Slovakia.;Sprocha, B (通讯作者)，SAS, Ctr Social & Psychol Sci, Bratislava, Slovakia.",branislav.sprocha@gmail.com; bleha@fns.uniba.sk,"Šprocha, Branislav/AHB-3669-2022; Bleha, Branislav/HTO-1046-2023; Šprocha, Branislav/JXY-5130-2024","Šprocha, Branislav/0000-0001-6197-0519; Bleha, Branislav/0000-0001-9302-8114",VEGA agency [1/0745/16],VEGA agency(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),Research was supported by the VEGA agency within the project No. 1/0745/16.,,56,7,7,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This paper analyses HSR passenger flows instead of commonly-used time schedules for measuring different polycentricity in urban networks. Using 2013 origin/destination (O/D) passenger flow data, we analyse the spatial configurations of 99 HSR cities at the national scale in China. In addition, we compare the spatial configurations of three regional urban networks: the Pearl River Delta, the Yangzi River Delta and the Bohai Rim. The outcomes show that the three functional regions connected by HSR are the most dominant polycentric regions in China and that the Bohai Rim is less hierarchical than the other two. We conclude that the comprehensive Chinese HSR networks are largely polycentric, especially in the central and eastern regions.","[Yang, Haoran; Dijst, Martin; Witte, Patrick; Van Ginkel, Hans] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Yang, Weiling] Fudan Univ, Sch Int Relat & Publ Affairs, 220 Handan RD, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Utrecht University; Fudan University,"Yang, HR (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",H.Yang2@uu.nl; M.J.Dijst@uu.nl; P.A.Witte@uu.nl; kmyangweiling@126.com,"Dijst, Martin/ABF-5649-2021; Yang, Haoran/GXH-6567-2022","Dijst, Martin/0000-0002-7666-3455; Yang, Haoran/0000-0001-5572-9390",,,,,38,21,28,6,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We begin by situating current initiatives-namely, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010-in a much longer trajectory of attempts to construct a national market for home mortgages. Following the theorization of the economy of qualities by Callon, Meadel, and Rabeharisoa, we argue that a dominant theme throughout has been creating or fixing mortgage markets by performing work on the commodities-the mortgage products-that circulate in them. In light of this history, we argue that Dodd-Frank's primary novelty lies in the way it alters relations between those products and market-supporting institutions, laws, and regulations. We conclude that this shapes a new set of contradictions and conflicts between market liquidity and risk taking, on the one hand, and the original concerns with financial safety and soundness, on the other.","[Ashton, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Christophers, Brett] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Uppsala University,"Ashton, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Urban Planning & Policy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",pashton@uic.edu,,"Ashton, Philip/0000-0001-9257-9424",Federal Housing Administration (FHA); giant government; Federal National Mortgage Association; Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,Federal Housing Administration (FHA); giant government; Federal National Mortgage Association; Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,"These agencies include the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the giant government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).

After the EU accession, Romania had a budget of 19.06 billion euros to reduce economic disparities and boost the regional economy. With an absorption rate of 90.44% between 2007-2013, Romania was the penultimate Member State in this area. Although the absorbed amount is very high, the impact was inconsistent at national level and disparities between regions have grown. Leaving aside indicators and statistical figures (which may confirm the impact or not), the results are not so visible to citizens.

A comprehensive assessment of these impacts for project's life-cycle is of great importance. The proposed methodology has created the required framework for such assessment by using Concept Mapping, Focus Group, and Multi-Attribute Decision Making Techniques. Petroleum refinery industry (PRI) is comprised of a chain of expertise and engineering disciplines and is also connected to various other industries. Consequently, apart from its physical products that fulfill the fuel needs of the society, PRI has a great contribution to economic development and to the prosperity of different businesses. On the negative side, however, PRI is one of the primary contributors to global warming and other environmental issues and could have some unwelcome effects on the society as well. Hence, development of these projects should be done with careful assessment of their life-long impacts from a sustainability viewpoint. In this study, a sustainability framework for PRI projects, which was developed and presented in a previous publication, is used in a multiphase methodology to assess the relationship between life-cycle phases and sub-phases of a petroleum refinery on one hand, and sustainability indicators and factors on the other hand. As a result of this study, critical sustainability factors can be highlighted, to help managers and industry experts consider long-term sustainability consequences in their decision making process. The proposed methodology has been applied to a real petroleum refinery project, using an MADM-based scenario approach, to assess the correlation between sustainability factors and various life-cycle phases and sub-phases of the refinery. Based on the results, the most important phase in the petroleum refinery life-cycle with regards to all three pillars of sustainability is found to be the operation phase. As such, implementation of various operation phase sustainability aspects should be the first priority of stakeholders during design, procurement, construction, and operation phases.","[Gholipour, Yaghob] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Engn Optimizat Res Gr, Tehran, Iran; [Hasheminasab, Hamidreza] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Kharrazi, Mohammad] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Off Sustainable Dev, Tehran, Iran; [Streimikis, Justas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Div Farms & Enterprises Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Tehran; University of Tehran; Amirkabir University of Technology; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Gholipour, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Engn Optimizat Res Gr, Tehran, Iran.",ygholipour@ut.ac.ir; hasheminasab@ut.ac.ir; mkharrazi@hotmail.com; Justas.streimikis@gmail.com,"Gholipour, Yaghob/C-2760-2018; Hasheminasab, Hamidreza/AAZ-9574-2021","Gholipour, Yaghob/0000-0001-7269-6623; Hasheminasab, Hamidreza/0000-0003-0650-2733; Streimikis, Justas/0000-0003-2619-3229",,,,,40,7,7,1,15,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

A fast pace of life causes by stress today to be seen as a natural part of our life. However, it must be borne in mind that stress is involved in the development of various civilization diseases, especially heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders or mental illness. The organization of time and its appropriate use is the basis for an optimal lifestyle that takes account of work responsibilities, but at the same time it provides plenty of space for relaxation in leisure. By appropriately dividing the time between the necessary daily activities, the negative phenomena of contemporary society such as stress, depression or inability to cope with crisis situations can be avoided. The importance of time management in personal and work life is associated with optimal organization of activities and prioritization. One of the core tasks of the manager is performing their work efficiently. It means arrange everything to do what is necessary for the job to be successful. The basic prerequisites for doing this work are the good results of the work achieved by performing effective activities using their intelligence, imagination and knowledge. The extent to which managers are effective depends largely not only causes by stressors but also on the external conditions of their work - the distraction.

Accountability in question is responsible for the management of village budgets. For now the common obstacle felt by most villages is related to the limitations in village finances. Often the Village Revenue and Expenditure Budget (APBDes) is not balanced, between receipts and expenditures. Such facts are caused by four major factors (Hudayana and FPPD, 2005). First: the village has a small revenu and its source of income is very dependent on very little aid. Second: village people's welfare is low. Third: the low operational funds of the village to run the service. Fourth: that many development programs enter the village, but only managed by the service. The purpose of this study is to develop village financial management software implementation of Law no 6 2014 to realize Good Village Governance.

Research has so far concentrated on CSR in large companies as it is not a usual practice in SMEs, particularly in connection with internationalization. High-tech SMEs face resource constraints and knowledge to apply CSR as a competitive tool in internationalization. In this paper, it is argued that development and implementation of CSR based internationalization in SMEs is a difficult learning process, which needs to be coordinated and supported by other firms in their network. Trust between the partners is necessary for collaboration. By applying an interactive approach, data has been collected from the ongoing marketing process in four high-tech Swedish SMEs in the steel industry. All the participating SMEs understand the importance of CSR in international marketing. However, success of CSR implementation in the SMEs varied depending on the area of business. The least CSR implemented SME focused on the improvement of work environment and financial sustainability through partnership with the customers and the investors. The most successful CSR focused company dealt with industrial residues and extraction of other minerals from hazardous waste for selling, making the reuse of residues possible. This study highlights the need of sustainability, both for the high-tech manufacturing SMEs and creating a strong selling argument towards the international buyers.","[Hyder, Akmal S.; Sundstrom, Agneta] Univ Gavle, Gavle, Sweden",University of Gavle,"Hyder, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Gavle, Gavle, Sweden.",ahr@hig.se; awd@hig.se,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3868,3872,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800100,0

This is potentially useful for audiences ranging from macro-level policy-makers to teachers to parents to the students themselves in improving the design of policies and practices that either address life-satisfaction directly or affect it indirectly by pursuing other objectives. We use ordered logit and OLS regression models in various specifications to explore how different factors of students' life from various domains (e.g. housing, economic, lifestyle, personal) associate with their self-assessed degree (0-10 scale) of life satisfaction or happiness. The effects of independent variables were investigated both separately within their own domain, and in all-inclusive models while always controlling for gender, age and specific effects of particular schools. The results confirm quite robustly several well-established and expected effects, namely the positive effects of one's relations to parents and friends, or one's health conditions, and negative effects of smoking tobacco or being discriminated. The findings also reveal some relatively unestablished facts such as a large positive effect of being needed, or the negative effect of commuting time. The outright surprising results include the irrelevance of alcohol consumption (contrary to expected negative effects and in contrast to identified negative effects of tobacco consumption) or of the absolute amount of money available (contrary to expected positive effects); the positive effect of cannabis use and of being a vegan; or the partially negative effect of engaging in arts or creative activities. While the above results are not all easily turned into recommendations for students, their parents, school administrators or policy makers on how to secure a happy life of teenagers, there are a few that may go beyond the obvious: avoid smoking, consider commuting time seriously, encourage and nurture good relations.

It addresses the potential bias from unobserved heterogeneity among individuals, work establishments and cities. The paper also identifies diversity impacts at both city and workplace scales, and considers how relationships vary across different segments of the labor market.

In the last years, the increasing number of single-member households has become a significant issue in Slovakia. In 2011, ratio of single-member households was more than 25% in Slovakia (The 2011 Population and Housing Census in Slovakia). It is an interesting phenomenon influencing not only labor market (paid work), but also unpaid work activities (work performed in households) and spending of the leisure time. The aim of this study was to examine the time use of single-member households in Slovakia. We analyzed 301 single-member households and allocation of their daily time into 13 activities. To get information about the daily time use of persons, we used household member diary. Study offers unique data, based on the original field research on time use of Slovak households and individuals, which was conducted in 2017 by team of researchers from Faculty of Economics, Matej Bel University in Slovakia. Besides collecting data on time use, we also collected information about the attitudes and preferences of individuals concerning the paid work and unpaid work. Within the single-member households, we analyzed and compared specific groups of persons - men and women, and persons younger than 30 years of age and persons over 65 years of age. We found out, that young persons living alone spend significant part of their daily activities by paid work (almost 2 and half hours more than an average for person in multi-persons households). Men living alone spend significant part of their daily time in paid work and by sport and usage of modern technologies. Time use of persons over 65 years living alone pointed to problem of their social isolation and absence of education in this age group.","[Knapkova, Miroslava] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Kascakova, Alena] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Knapková, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",miroslava.knapkova@umb.sk; alena.kascakova@umb.sk,"knapkova, miroslava/E-3963-2017","knapkova, miroslava/0000-0002-1602-5398",scientific project of Grant Agency VEGA [1/0621/17],scientific project of Grant Agency VEGA,"This paper is an output of scientific project of Grant Agency VEGA no.

Affordability is usually calculated according to a ratio between household income and housing costs. Eurostat defined the housing cost overburden rate the percentage of the population living in a household where total housing costs (net of housing allowances) represent more than 40 % of the total disposable household income (net of housing allowances). In this paper, after data exploration analysis, multivariate statistical methods were used to identify which of the selected 28 European countries have similar housing affordability. In the analysis were applied methods: principal components analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis. The level of the housing affordability was described by 23 variables.

However, how green brand affects brand equity and firm performance is still unknown by the green-brand firms. This study aims to investigate the relationships among green brand, brand equity, and firm performance. Using the data from top 500 Chinese valuable brands listed in China's A-share market in 2017, and multiple linear regression model, the impacts of green brand on brand equity and firm performance have been examined. The moderating effect of firm innovation capability on the relationship between green brand and brand equity and the mediating effect of market performance on the relationship between brand equity and firm performance have been explored. The results show that green branding has a positive effect on brand equity, and this relationship is positively moderated by firm innovation capability. Moreover, brand equity exerts a positive effect on market performance and firm performance, and market performance plays a mediating role in the relationship between brand equity and firm performance. The conclusions have revealed that investing resources in green branding helps to foster firm performance in green consumption situations and it also provides crucial insights into how firms can cultivate green brand and enhance brand equity and firm performance.","[Li, Juan; Sun, Xixiang; Li, Gen] Wuhan Univ Technol, Coll Management, 122,Luoshi South Rd, Hongshan Dist 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Coll Management, 122,Luoshi South Rd, Hongshan Dist 430070, Peoples R China.",15827426569@163.com; 13971190718@163.com; mills0110@whut.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [71772143],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was supported by National Science Foundation of China (Grants: 71772143).,,37,9,9,4,47,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

It can be noticed that in recent years some of the service providers build value for the customer in the distribution channels, making it easier for consumers to return product or resign from obtained services. In author's opinion, the stage of customer's resignation from further cooperation with a current brand seems to be the most neglected by researchers. On the basis of quantitative and qualitative research, the author tries to answer the following research question: Which factor is the most important for intention to use an online channel in order to resign? and How do consumers most often terminate contracts with service providers? The conclusions from the study show that some service providers make it difficult for consumers to resign from their services and that the own experience of the respondents to the greatest extent encourages the use of an internet channel for this purpose.","[Lipowski, Marcin] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Lipowski, M (通讯作者)，Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland.",marcin.lipowski@umcs.pl,"Lipowski, Marcin/V-2983-2018",,"National Science Centre, Poland [2014/13/B/HS4/01612]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","Source of research: National Science Centre, Poland, grant No. 2014/13/B/HS4/01612.",,42,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,5270,5278,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553206029,0

Owing to the fact that CSR and TBL are strategically oriented on business objectives of sustainable development, especially in managing eco-efficiency, this type of value is being named - Sustainable Value Added (SVA). However, since previous research and constructive criticism of SVA models have not been adequately tested by applying the appropriate econometric models so far, in this paper author introduces applicable empirical testing of the SVA sensitivity on the Triple Bottom Line aspects: 1) financial, 2) environmental and 3) social business results. The aim of this paper is to conduct research on SVA as an integrative measure for quantitative assessment of company contributions to the long-term sustainable development. The author also advocates an important thesis regarding the extraction of the TBL data, implicating that this process validates only when a relevant number of companies, across different benchmarks, regularly publishes annual CSR reports. Such publishing ensures transparent and unified TBL data essential for SVA analysis. Research methodology rests on the comparison of SVA with a traditional economic measure of Value Added (VA) in terms of their contributions to business sustainability. Empirical testing indicates significant differences between the SVA and VA regarding their financial, environmental and social sustainability effects. Testing empirically confirms SVA as an integrative measure for sustainable business contributions. This ensures the presentation of complete and standardized data of triple results required for SVA analysis. Additional objective in this context was to investigate eco-efficiency of a specific benchmark as a sustainability precondition, measured by using the SVA.","[Miljenovic, Dejan] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Miljenovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",dejan.miljenovic@efri.hr,"Miljenovic, Dejan/R-8088-2018","Miljenovic, Dejan/0000-0002-3644-6077",,,,,42,5,5,1,24,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Small economies benefit from imports of foreign technologies through international trade and foreign investments and are subjects to significant exogenous shocks that impact their business cycle. The economic analysis is based on the demand and supply theories of innovation and economic fluctuations. Hypotheses about long term and short term (Granger) effects are tested on Austrian historical data (1852-1979) about the economic output (gross domestic product and industry production) and innovation output (granted patents). The econometric analysis utilizes vector error correction procedure to estimate time-series models of the economy. The results are interpreted in Austrian historical context. The economic-historical analysis suggests that there is no long-term relationship between business cycles and innovative activity between 1852 and 1937. The long-term relationship manifested only between 1948 and 1979. This relationship is very complex and influenced by the historical context, and it is not easy to grasp by the econometric analysis. In the short run, there is no compelling evidence trough-out the analyzed time period (1852-1979). However, we cannot fully reject the hypothesis suggesting a relationship between economic cycles and innovative activities. In the most recent period (1948-1979), we can observe a negative impact (Granger causality) of granted patents on the real GDP. Future research taking into account more countries using parametric as well as non-parametric approach could shed some light on the demand hypothesis in the pre-war and post-war development of small open economies. This paper showed that there is a long-term equilibrium between economic output and innovation activity. This result suggests that long term factors such as political stability are behind the complex relationship.","[Minarik, Pavol] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ, Dept Econ & Management, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Vokoun, Marek; Stellner, Frantisek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Corporate Strategy Dept Humanities, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Minárik, P (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ, Dept Econ & Management, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",pavol.minarik@ujep.cz; marek.vokoun@mail.vstecb.cz; stellner@mail.vstecb.cz,"Minarik, Pavol/Q-5977-2019; Vokoun, Marek/AAI-3302-2020","Minarik, Pavol/0000-0002-3913-2006; Vokoun, Marek/0000-0001-5659-3085; Stellner, Frantisek/0000-0002-8519-8401",,,,,51,4,4,0,10,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The basis of the research methodology is the analysis and synthesis of experience, scientific approaches and fundamental principles of modern state governance in their direct connection with the status of human rights and the value priorities of sustainable development. It is argued that in the dynamics of social changes affected by extraordinary external or internal factors an institutional resilience of public administration becomes an important imperative of sustainable development. It allows maintaining structural integrity, functional value, interoperability, regrouping, updating and efficiency. Human rights, along with the imperatives of sustainable development, create the basis of humanistic potential, which causes changes in the paradigm of modern state administration in favor of increasing the level of democracy of power and self-organization of society through the implementation of democratic reforms in key areas of the functioning of society and governance. There is an organic connection between the status of implementation of human rights and the possibility of implementing strategies for sustainable development: without entrenching in human consciousness of human rights as fundamental principles of functioning of the society (including administration), sustainable development risks to become a loud slogan for a long time, especially in countries of democratic transition. Thus, changing the paradigm of public administration on the basis of ecological government, social justice and nondiscrimination is a prerequisite for the implementation of sustainable development strategies.","[Novak-Kalyayeva, Larysa; Andreyeva, Svitlana] Natl Acad Publ Adm, Lviv Reg Inst Publ Adm, Off President Ukraine, Lvov, Ukraine; [Kuczabski, Aleksander] Univ Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland; [Yasnyska, Natalia] Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Lviv Reg Inst Publ Adm, Lvov, Ukraine; [Shapovalova, Iryna] Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi Natl Army Acad, Lvov, Ukraine","National Academy of Public Administration under the President of Ukraine; Odessa Regional Institute for Public Administration, National Academy for Public Administration; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; National Academy of Public Administration under the President of Ukraine; Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Army Academy","Novak-Kalyayeva, L (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Publ Adm, Lviv Reg Inst Publ Adm, Off President Ukraine, Lvov, Ukraine.",novak.kalyayeva@gmail.com; kuczabski@gmail.com; natayas@ukr.net; saclviv@gmail.com; mladshenkij15@gmail.com,"Andreyeva, Svetlana/AAQ-9613-2021; Novak-Kalyayeva, Larysa/B-4578-2017","Andreyeva, Svetlana/0000-0003-3635-4209; Novak-Kalyayeva, Larysa/0000-0002-2897-8858",,,,,16,2,2,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2023,2031,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203010,0

An empirical application shows a strong bidirectional predictive linkage between US interest rates and NBER business cycle recession and expansion periods. Due to the predictability of the business cycle regimes, the proposed model yields superior out-of-sample forecasts of the US short-term interest rate and the term spread compared with the linear and nonlinear vector autoregressive (VAR) models, including the Markov switching VAR model.","[Nyberg, Henri] Univ Turku, Dept Math & Stat, Turku 20014, Finland; [Nyberg, Henri] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland",University of Turku; University of Helsinki,"Nyberg, H (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Dept Math & Stat, Turku 20014, Finland.",henri.nyberg@utu.fi,,,Academy of Finland; University of Helsinki,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); University of Helsinki,"The author would like to thank the Editor, anonymous referee, as well as Graham Elliott, Markku Lanne, Pentti Saikkonen, and the participants at the 7th Nordic Econometric Meeting Bergen 2013, the 7th International Conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics London 2013, the 34th International Symposium on Forecasting Rotterdam 2014 and the 8th conference on Growth and Business Cycles in Theory and Practice Manchester 2016 for useful comments.

The goal of this article is to assess and quantify inequalities in health status of inhabitants depending on socio-economic situation in European countries based on selected social and health indicators in two different periods. The earlier period is the year 2000, and the later period is the year 2015 or the most recent years. The results of the analysis based on multidimensional statistical methods should give an answer to the question as to whether and how strongly the socio-economic situation in the countries of Europe affects the health status of the population and how the situation has changed over the course of 15 years. In accordance with the stated objectives we have chosen 15 variables (source: WHO, OECD, Eurostat). These variables (indicators) together characterize the quality of life in terms of socio-economic situation and state of health of citizens in 22 selected European countries. The choice of countries was mainly influenced by the availability of data of the selected variables in the both years 2000 and 2015. According to the above mentioned goals of the article we have used factor analysis, cluster analysis and multidimensional comparative analysis methods on data sets of health and socio-economic indicators in the both years. The results of the application of these multidimensional statistical methods, their comparisons and comparisons over time can provide information on whether the targets of the European Commission and the OECD to reduce health inequalities, depending on the socio-economic situation in European countries, in the period from 2000 to 2015 have been achieved.","[Pacakova, Viera; Kopecka, Lucie] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Math & Quantitat Methods, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Pacáková, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Math & Quantitat Methods, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Viera.Pacakova@upce.cz; Lucie.Kopecka1@student.upce.cz,,,,,,,41,8,8,2,12,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It develops the spatial concept of integrated peripheries in core-based macroregional production networks. Conceptually, it draws on the dynamic notion of uneven development in contemporary capitalism, namely, on David Harvey's spatiotemporal fix and on the global production networks concept of strategic coupling to investigate the mode of articulation of integrated peripheries into macro-regional production networks. Empirically, it analyzes the quantity and quality of supplier linkages in the automotive industry of Slovakia based on unique data collected by the author from both foreign subsidiaries and domestic firms through a survey completed by 133 automotive firms in 2010 and interviews with 50 automotive firms conducted between 2011 and 2015. The empirical analysis uncovered weak and dependent supplier linkages between foreign subsidiaries and domestic firms, which undermine the potential for technology and knowledge transfer from foreign subsidiaries to the domestic economy and positive long-term regional development effects of large FDI by automotive industry corporations in integrated peripheries.","[Pavlinek, Petr] Univ Nebraska, Dept Geog & Geol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Pavlinek, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, CR-11636 Prague, Czech Republic",University of Nebraska System; Charles University Prague,"Pavlínek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Geog & Geol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.;Pavlínek, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, CR-11636 Prague, Czech Republic.",ppavlinek@unomaha.edu,"Pavlinek, Petr/AAG-9131-2021","Pavlinek, Petr/0000-0003-2799-1230",Czech Science Foundation [16-21076S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"I wish to thank Henry Yeung and three anonymous referees for their comments on an earlier version of this article.

For this reason, many organizations develop processes that support innovation. In Portugal, the Portuguese Standard 4457:2007 (NP4457), which defines the requirements for a Research, Development and Innovation Management System (RDIMS), was introduced in 2007. These requirements act as guidelines for organizations that recognize the importance of innovation. The purpose of this paper is to present a RDIMS that supports the management of innovation in the company Gelado Colorido, based on NP4457. A case study was carried out in a business environment with a duration of 6 months. After analysing the reality of the company an Innovation Support System was presented divided in: Strategic Definition, Innovation Process and RDIMS Evaluation. Although it was created for a specific firm, it is based on generic references and it doesn't involve specific activities or characteristics of the organization or industry for which it was intended, which makes it possible to adapt it to other SMEs that are interested in improving innovation management performance and/or in the NP4457 certification.","[Pereira, J.; Romero, F.] Univ Minho, Dept Prod & Syst, Braga, Portugal; [Romero, F.] Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Res Ctr, Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Romero, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Campus Azurem, Braga, Portugal.",fromero@dps.uminho.pt,"Romero, Fernando/M-7976-2014","Romero, Fernando/0000-0002-7540-8540; Pereira, Joao/0000-0001-9812-0585",COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007043]; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [UID/CEC/00319/2013],COMPETE; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work has been supported by COMPETE: POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007043 and FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia within the Project Scope: UID/CEC/00319/2013.,,27,0,0,1,9,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-8-1,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2018,,,,,,,185,191,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN0TO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473533800031,0

This research used the Design Science Research (DSR) model in Information Systems with the challenge to develop a system with the characteristics referred above. This objective was achieved with the use of technical approaches focused on data integration with particular concerns in data quality and the systems' functional efficiency. The work produced a technical artifact that was further implemented in the Ciencia Vitae system and evaluated by its stakeholders in an iterative reviewing process.

To describe and compare Slovak NUTS III regions from the view point of regional development potential of human sources and human capital, we will use indicators of regional economic value (regional gross value added) and its structure (by sectors of economy), structure of education of economically active population and structure of professions by employees in regions. Slovakia and its regions are not technology or scientific-research leaders. Slovak regions belong according ESPON categorisation to the category of imitative innovation area (except Bratislava region, which belong to smart and creative diversification areas). Human capital in such regions, his ability of knowledge acquisition and application, the ability to learn and amplify innovations gained from leaders are key development factors of regional development potential.

The safeguard procedure should help the enterprise to solve their problematic situation because it protects them against creditors for the court approved time period. The safeguard procedure cannot be successful when the financial situation is extremely poor and therefore this paper analyses the enterprises' financial situation upon applying for safeguard. The situation is evaluated using bankruptcy models, such as Altman Z-Score, Kralicek Quick Test, IN 99 and IN05. The evaluation is conducted in different time moments, specifically one year, two years and three years before implementing the safeguard procedure. Results for the individual enterprises are summed up by basic descriptive statistics as mean, median, low and upper quartiles.

To date, however, there has been limited exploration into whether long-run evolutionary growth paths or trajectories influence regional economic resilience and what types of trajectories might be more associated with resilience. This article explores the connections between regional economic resilience and regional and national growth trajectories by utilizing a novel set of methods to group regions according to the similarity of their growth paths, identifying the relative importance of national growth for regional growth, and categorizing regions according to their resilience to the 2007-2008 economic crisis. The results suggest that regions have empirically identifiable long-run and path-dependent development trajectories that are significantly associated with industrial employment shares and observed resilience outcomes. Critically, however, these regional growth paths are significantly shaped by national trajectories. Furthermore, regions with greater employment shares in sectors that are less susceptible to demand fluctuations are likely to experience more stable growth rates and be more resilient to economic downturns. This has implications for understanding the importance of evolutionary trends and specifically the role of national contexts and industrial legacies in shaping regional resilience.","[Webber, Don J.] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England; [Healy, Adrian; Bristow, Gillian] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of West England; Cardiff University,"Webber, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Bristol, Avon, England.",Don.Webber@uwe.ac.uk; HealyA2@cardiff.ac.uk; BristowG1@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,49,53,22,157,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

The aim of the paper is to examine the market reaction to share repurchase announcements and to investigate the reasons for the market reaction. There is a good deal of research referring to the share repurchases, even in Poland, the originality of our approach is that we conducted our research on an alternative system of trading to the Warsaw Stock of Exchange, namely NewConnect. NewConnect is dedicated to young, small and innovative companies. We found it extremely interesting that such companies in need of external financing take the decision to distribute cash and implement share repurchase. The data was collected for 64 share repurchase announcements over the period 2007-2016. In this study cumulative average abnormal returns are applied to identify the market reaction. To investigate the factors which drive investor behaviour we applied the regressions model. We employed some explanatory variables describing the agency theory and signalling hypotheses: relative payout, market to book ratio, operational cash flow, and debt ratio. We found that cumulative average abnormal returns around the share repurchase date are significant at standard levels of confidence in all the analysed event windows. The results of the multivariate and univariate regression analyses do not support the undervaluation hypothesis, as we expected.","[Wronska-Bukalska, Elzbieta] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Lublin, Poland; [Kazmierska-Jozwiak, Bogna] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland; [Rozkovec, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Liberec, Czech Republic",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University; University of Lodz; Technical University Liberec,"Wronska-Bukalska, E (通讯作者)，Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Finance, Lublin, Poland.",elzbieta.bukalska@umcs.lublin.pl; bognakaj@uni.lodz.pl; jiri.rozkovec@tul.cz,"Bukalska, Elżbieta/AAM-6461-2021; Rozkovec, Jiri/AFP-2672-2022; Bukalska, Elżbieta/JXL-6679-2024; Kazmierska-Jozwiak, Bogna/AFT-9453-2022","Bukalska, Elżbieta/0000-0001-8097-5964; Rozkovec, Jiri/0000-0001-8870-5467; Bukalska, Elżbieta/0000-0001-8097-5964; Kazmierska-Jozwiak, Bogna/0000-0002-1692-7682",,,,,31,1,2,1,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The case highlights the main system deficiencies in all relevant contexts, from legislation through its implementation and enforcement, to political, business and overall culture.

When selling through a common retailer, we findin contrast to the conventional understanding of tacit collusion that firms act to maximize industry profitsthat colluding manufacturers strategically induce double marginalization so that retail prices are above the monopoly level. This lowers industry profits but increases the profit share that manufacturers appropriate from the retailer. Comparing common distribution with independent (exclusive) distribution, we show that the latter facilitates collusion. Despite this result, common retailing leads to lower welfare because a common retailer monopolizes the downstream market. For the case of independent retailing, we also demonstrate that contract offers that are observable to the rival retailer are not necessarily beneficial for collusive purposes.","[Reisinger, Markus] Frankfurt Sch Finance& Management, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Thomes, Tim Paul] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Reisinger, M (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance& Management, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany.",m.reisinger@fs.de; thomes@dice.hhu.de,,,,,,,43,11,12,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Individuals can benefit without having to pay, so there is little incentive to invest or manage resources efficiently. The punishment of criminals is an example of this, since everyone in a society benefits from reduced crime whether they pay to apprehend criminals or not. On that basis, it is widely presumed that governments must provide criminal justice services, including prisons. But the evidence in favor of that view is ambiguous. Stateless societies throughout history have found ways to maintain public order without ever building a prison. Nations with adequate social safety nets and a high degree of equality are also likely to rely on alternatives to incarceration. Strong forms of public goods theory, when applied to punishments and prisons, are shown to be false, since crime control does exist without a centralized state. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that centralized government provision and management can also suffer inefficiencies from overproduction. Only comparative institutional analysis can speak to the efficiency potentials of punishment, wherein the costs of underproduction are assessed against the likely consequences of overproduction.","[D'Amico, Daniel J.] Brown Univ, Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [D'Amico, Daniel J.] Polit Theory Project, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"D'Amico, DJ (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;D'Amico, DJ (通讯作者)，Polit Theory Project, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Daniel_Damico@brown.edu,,,,,,,103,3,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

We begin by developing a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that is built upon precision-based algorithms, in order to improve the computational efficiency. We then investigate the forecast performances of these infinite hidden Markov switching models. Our forecasting results suggest that (1) models with separate infinite hidden Markov processes for the VAR coefficients and the volatilities generally forecast better than other specifications of infinite hidden Markov switching models; (2) using a single infinite hidden Markov process to govern all model parameters tends to result in poor forecasts; (3) most of the gains obtained when forecasting the inflation rate and GDP growth seem to come from allowing for time-variation in the volatilities rather than in the conditional mean coefficients. In contrast, when forecasting the short-term interest rate it is important to allow time-variation in all model parameters. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Volatility in income and expenses are predictive of households' ability to meet food needs, and parents who have experienced large or volatile expenses report more difficulty in shielding child(ren) from food hardships. Food insecurity is characterized by a continuum of financial adaptations-ranging from relying on savings, borrowing from family and friends, and increased work effort in conjunction with marginal food security, and progressing toward use of potentially inferior forms of credit such as payday and pawn loans at the more severe end of the food insecurity spectrum. In addition to income-focused coping strategies, survey respondents report food-specific coping strategies.

Unbanked households and households that use alternative financial service transaction products are more likely to experience very low food security and food insecurity than other households. Currently unbanked but previously banked households as well as underbanked households face the greatest risk of food insecurity.

To achieve these goals, there are a number of policy measures that are tailored to specific actors to alter their behaviour by changing their transport context. To analyse such measure in advance, we propose a multi agent transport simulation of passenger and freight. We specify the objectives of the agents and analyse whether our model is sensitive to a typical policy measure, i.e. a distance dependent toll for heavy vehicles within a low emission zone. Additionally, we study the computational costs of our model. Based on a sandbox scenario, we illustrate that our model is able to capture the behavioural adaptations and interdependencies of passenger and freight traffic, and that we are able to take into account that policy measures for a specific subset can affect the entire transport system.

Allowing for these issues is done by augmenting autoregressive models of growth with cross-country weighted averages of growth and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity framework. The forecasts are evaluated using statistical criteria through point and density forecasts, and an economic criterion based on forecasting recessions. The results show that, compared to an autoregressive model, both components improve forecast ability in terms of point and density forecasts, especially one-period-ahead forecasts, but that the forecast ability is not stable over time. The random walk model, however, still dominates in terms of forecasting recessions.","[Trypsteen, Steven] ING Belgium, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",,"Trypsteen, S (通讯作者)，ING Belgium, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",steven.trypsteen@ing.be,,,,,,,31,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

It modeled urban rail supply, measured by vehicle-kilometers of the urban rail service, incorporating demand for urban rail travel, urban rail travel speed, conditions of alternative transportation modes, land use patterns, and socioeconomic conditions as explanatory variables. The model adopted a lag structure for urban rail supply in line with the planning horizon. It was then estimated using the Bayesian model averaging approach, which provided robust estimation results based on our multivariate time series data. The results showed that investments in the urban rail network in Tokyo were primarily driven by the increase in demand for urban rail travel. In effect, demand growth in the Tokyo rail network has clearly translated to supply growth through the planning process; this induced supply has worked as one of the critical components in the establishment of a rail-oriented transportation system in Tokyo. Additionally, the negative effects of bus/tram travel speed on urban rail supply were estimated.","[Abe, Ryosuke; Kato, Hironori] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Abe, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",abe-r@ip.civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kato@civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Abe, Ryosuke/S-8399-2018","Abe, Ryosuke/0000-0003-2994-3398",,,,,47,9,10,5,43,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This shifting professional environment is prompting lively and sometimes bitter debates about how transportation models should be used. While these models and their outputs play an increasingly more important function in transport-related decision-making processes, growing concerns emerge about their limitations, assumptions, biases, and usability. This paper addresses the question of how different professionals involved in transportation planning perceive and experience these tensions. For that purpose, we developed an online survey which was completed by 229 European transport planning practitioners, primarily working in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. Our findings support the following key conclusions. First, and contrary to popular notions on the matter, practitioners are relatively satisfied with the models they use. Second, most respondents are confident that they understand the assumptions and uncertainties associated with transport models, but that other important stakeholders do not. However, third, the larger the distance that respondents have to hands-on working experience with transportation models, the lower is their trust on model outputs. Respondents who are not directly involved in the operation of the models a) report more negative experiences associated with model use in decision-making processes and b) identify more usability barriers. The overall picture revealed a lack of trust amongst transport planning professionals, which is a problem needing to be addressed. We propose bringing models closer to those who use their outputs as a constructive solution to this trust deficit.","[te Brommelstroet, Marco] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nicolaisen, Morten Skou] Ctr Urban Dev & Mobil, Aarhus, Denmark; [Buettner, Benjamin] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Ferreira, Antonio] Ferreira Solut, Coimbra, Portugal",University of Amsterdam; Technical University of Munich,"te Brömmelstroet, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",brommelstroet@uva.nl,"Ferreira, Antonio/R-2776-2019","Ferreira, Antonio/0000-0002-7004-6165; Buettner, Benjamin/0000-0003-4733-545X","KPVV, a Dutch knowledge platform","KPVV, a Dutch knowledge platform","This research has been supported by KPVV, a Dutch knowledge platform, and especially by Bram van Luipen.

The bound increases with the punishment, hence its use as a conviction threshold may leave too many offenders of severe crimes at large. Plea bargaining addresses this limitation but introduces strategic interaction between concerned parties. Considering strategic interaction between defendants and judge/jury, it is shown that to any plea offer there corresponds a unique equilibrium. Moreover, all equilibria share the same conviction threshold, given by the reasonable doubt bound. The latter property ensures that the plea bargaining procedure is consistent with the 'equality before the law' principle. The former property (that to any plea offer there corresponds a unique equilibrium) bears implications for the design of plea bargain schemes.","[Tsur, Yacov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Tsur, Y (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel.",yacov.tsur@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Tsur, Yacov/0000-0001-6374-3838",,,,,29,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

At the same time politicians are criticized for taking 'political' decisions with not enough regard for the outcomes of such technical work. Increasingly attempts to capture the embodied knowledge and values of citizens are also brought into this contested terrain. But which knowledge forms should be significant in making policy and taking decisions; and how might they be brought together in political decision-making which is itself subject to its own rationality? This paper argues that the variety of knowledge forms in everyday transport planning processes should be more transparently articulated. Subsequent reflexion can help enhance the quality of transport planning processes, while such transparency bolsters the democratic legitimacy of the outputs of such processes. Such a more explicitly communicative, trans-disciplinary mode of governance would help to challenge the power of political rationality. This conclusion has implications for how transport planning as a discipline is enacted.","[Vigar, Geoff] Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Vigar, G (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",Geoff.Vigar@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,74,37,40,2,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The latter dispensation is pinned on the belief that South African SMMEs make use of inadequate and ineffective internal control systems. Aim: Since a system of internal control comprises five inter-related elements, while also taking into consideration that management is ultimately responsible for the internal control in their respective business entities, which is greatly influenced by their managerial conduct, this research study placed focus on determining the relationship which exist between the managerial conduct and the internal control activities evident in South African SMMEs. Setting: This study was conducted in the Cape Metropole, South Africa by obtaining responses from 240 stakeholders of SMMEs: 120 members of management and 120 employees. Methods: In order to achieve the latter, quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire and analysed accordingly through both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Results: From the results, a very weak negative statistically significant relationship was identified between the managerial conduct and the internal control activities evident in South African SMMEs. Conclusion: Essentially, management and employees should revisit the internal control activities evident in their respective SMMEs through placing emphasis on those internal control activities which can be built on their control environment.","[Bruwer, Juan-Pierre] Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Sch Accounting Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Coetzee, Philna; Meiring, Jacolize] Univ South Africa, Coll Accounting Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",Cape Peninsula University of Technology; University of South Africa,"Bruwer, JP (通讯作者)，Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Sch Accounting Sci, Cape Town, South Africa.",bruwerjp@cput.ac.za,"Coetzee, Philna P/G-5602-2019","Meiring, Jacolize/0000-0003-3149-5694; Bruwer, Juan-Pierre/0000-0003-0879-2519",,,,,57,3,3,0,13,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Computers can produce statistical forecasts, but these are often adjusted judgmentally to take into account factors such as market intelligence. We explore the effects of two potential influences on these adjustments: the forecaster's involvement with the product category and their emotional reactions to particular products. Two forecasting experiments were conducted using data from a major Italian leather fashion goods producer. The participants' judgmental adjustments tended to lower the forecast accuracy, but especially when the participants had strong preferences for particular products. This appeared to result from a false consensus effect. The most accurate forecasts were made when the participants had no knowledge of the product and only received time series information, though a high level of involvement with the product category also led to a greater accuracy.

The prohibitions vary across leagues in content, scope, and enforcement, but at their core forbid clubs from soliciting another club's employees. Critically, the restrictions extend to discussions of employment that would commence only after a current employment contract ends. They therefore inhibit the flow of information about the demand for an employee's services. Professional sports leagues typically have monopsony power in labor markets. A no-solicitation agreement among league members has the capacity to lower employees' wages. For players, whose contractual rights are traded, such an agreement need not affect the distribution of employees across clubs; for other employees, it may cause a misallocation of employees and therefore a deadweight loss. A no-solicitation agreement may increase efficiency by enhancing the value of athletic competition, a product produced jointly by a sports league. But the argument that league anti-tampering rules have this effect is weak.

Following an increasing international debate on the topic, the contribution discusses the (im)possibility to develop a queer method or methodology. We stress how queering' methodologies and methods is not an ontological position pre-assumed when conducting research with queer-identified subjects, but is a process of dismantling taken-for-granted, stable, monolithic categories and identities. In order to do so, the paper discusses positionalities, situated knowledge and the different interactions - with both human and non-human actors - shaping the field. Through analysing body performances in the terms introduced by Taylor, a politics of becoming' emerges as a way to consider the relation between sexualities and spaces. The objects' of our research, that is, queer migrants, can thus be reframed following Braidotti's conceptualisation of the nomadic subject' and Deleuze and Guattari's desiring machines'. Since they are shaped by affects, personal trajectories are exceptional and unique, composing new territorial materialities.","[Di Feliciantonio, Cesare] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Methods & Models Space Econ & Finance, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Di Feliciantonio, Cesare] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci EES, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Gadelha, Kaciano B.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Rudesheimer Str 54-56, D-14197 Berlin, Germany",Sapienza University Rome; KU Leuven; Free University of Berlin,"Di Feliciantonio, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Methods & Models Space Econ & Finance, I-00161 Rome, Italy.;Di Feliciantonio, C (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci EES, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",cesare.difeliciantonio@uniroma1.it; kaciano.gadelha@fu-berlin.de,,"Di Feliciantonio, Cesare/0000-0002-4830-5212",,,,,69,13,15,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

A virtual machine is created in such a way that a user will not notice any difference from working on a physical computer. A challenging problem in cloud computing is how to distribute the virtual machines on a set of physical servers. An optimal solution will provide each virtual machine with enough resources and at the same time not using more physical services (energy/electricity) than necessary to achieve this. In this paper we investigate how forecasting of future resource requirements (CPU consumption) for each virtual machine can be used to improve the virtual machine placement on the physical servers. We demonstrate that a time-dependent hidden Markov model with an autoregressive observation process replicates the properties of the CPU consumption data in a realistic way and forecasts future CPU consumption efficiently.

In terms of forecasting, the random walk approximation of speculative prices has been established to provide 'naive' predictors that are most difficult to outperform by both purely backward-looking time series models and more structural approaches processing information from forward markets. We empirically assess the implicit predictive content of forward prices by means of waveletbased prediction of two foreign exchange (FX) rates and the price of Brent oil quoted either in US dollars or euros. Essentially, wavelet-based predictors are smoothed auxiliary (padded) time series quotes that are added to the sample information beyond the forecast origin. We compare wavelet predictors obtained from padding with constant prices (i.e. random walk predictors) and forward prices. For the case of FX markets, padding with forward prices is more effective than padding with constant prices, and, moreover, respective wavelet-based predictors outperform purely backward-looking time series approaches (ARIMA). For the case of Brent oil quoted in US dollars, wavelet-based predictors do not signal predictive content of forward prices for future spot prices.

This becomes especially relevant when various project alternatives are expected to show significantly different scores in case of incidents. Project alternatives and their road sections have different topological and geometrical characteristics. The focus of this paper is on the following characteristics: hard shoulders, the number of lanes, parallel road structures and weaving sections. The main question that this paper addresses is how these network characteristics affect both the risk of different types of incidents occurring and the effects of those incidents on the network performance (robustness). In order to answer this question, analytical examples are presented for small theoretical networks that give insight into how the selected characteristics affect the total delay caused by incidents and its dependence on the traffic volume, capacity, severity and duration of incidents. A marginal simulation based method is presented that can be used to compute the robustness effects of project alternatives, given their geometrical and topological characteristics, on a network level. A case study for an infrastructure project in the Netherlands is presented that illustrates how the robustness effects of infrastructure projects can be computed given their topological and geometrical characteristics.","[Snelder, M.; Wesseling, B.; van Arem, B.; Hertogh, M.

In contrast to existing approaches, the quarterly averages of our monthly estimates are exactly equal to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) quarterly estimates. The relationship between our monthly estimates and the quarterly data is therefore the same as the relationship between quarterly and annual data. The study makes use of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and data augmentation techniques to simulate values for the logarithms on monthly US GDP. The imposition of the exact linear quarterly constraint produces a non-standard distribution, necessitating the implementation of a Metropolis simulation step in the estimation. Our methodology can be easily generalized to cases where the variable of interest is monthly GDP and in such a way that the final results incorporate the statistical uncertainty associated with the monthly GDP estimates. We provide an example by incorporating our monthly estimates into a Markov switching model of the US business cycle.

We attempt to fill the void. Building on an identification strategy proposed in Dahl (Demography 47:689-718, 2010), we first establish the causal wage effects of marriage delay. We then propose ways to distinguish among competing theories and hypotheses, as well as the channels through which marriage delay affects wages. Specifically, we take advantage of their different implications for causal relationship, across gender and sub-populations. We reach two conclusions. First, we find a positive causal impact of marriage delay on wages, with a larger effect for women. Comparison of IV and OLS estimates suggests that the observed relationship between marriage delay and wages is attributed to both selection in late marriages and true causal effects. Second, we find strong evidence that the positive, causal effects are almost exclusively through increased education for both men and women.","[Wang, Chunbei; Wang, Le] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",Le.Wang.Econ@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,10,12,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Transportation systems, particularly urban freight, are complex, heterogeneous, and often poorly understood by policymakers. Enacting policies that impact such a complex system can lead to ineffective efforts, and often, negative unintended effects. The best way to avoid these outcomes is to ensure that urban freight policy is supported by behavior research. To understand what kind of research most effectively supports sound policymaking, the authors conduct an ex-post assessment of qualitative and quantitative research techniques to determine which one more effectively predicts the behavioral changes that were seen by transportation users in response to transportation policies. The authors identify the key findings of five large research projects that, using qualitative and quantitative research, investigated the stated and revealed behavioral reactions of transportation users to pricing and incentive policies in the New York City metropolitan area. The findings are catalogued and used to compare insights gained from the qualitative research, and from the quantitative research conducted afterwards. The analyses shed light on the potential and the limitations of both approaches, the synergies that exist between them, and their potential in assisting the development of effective urban freight policies.","[Holguin-Verasa, Jose] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, VREF Ctr Excellence Sustainable Urban Freight Sys, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Leal, Johanna Amaya] Iowa State Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Informat Syst, 2167 Union Dr, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Seruya, Barbara B.] B Seruya & Associates, New York, NY USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Iowa State University,"Holguín-Verasa, J (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, VREF Ctr Excellence Sustainable Urban Freight Sys, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",jhv@rpi.edu; amayaj@iastate.edu; bseruya@cs.com,,,,,,,42,27,31,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Productivity and efficiency analysis consequently provides a sound knowledge base. This paper illustrates how axiomatic production theory can be applied to model road freight transport, and proposes a logistics efficiency measure as the function representation. Based thereon, a logistics productivity index that decomposes into technical, cargo mix, vehicle capacity, and efficiency changes is established to determine the rate and drivers of growth. Emphasizing urban logistics, the paper discusses the limited access to reliable data at the micro level and illustrates how local or regional freight transport can be evaluated applying pseudo panel techniques to national freight surveys. Correspondingly, the theoretical productivity index is implemented on a pseudo panel covering the 24 largest cities in Norway between 2008 and 2012, when 12 of them entered a collaboration agreement to promote efficient transport. The results indicate a modest 0.6% average productivity growth. Efficiency change is the key driver of growth, countered by technical stagnation and regress. Negative productivity growth is expected if this trend continues. Moreover, the results do not reveal productivity gains from urban agglomeration or membership of the collaboration agreement, suggesting that prevailing transport and land use policies have so far been unable to foster productivity growth in urban freight transport.","[Rodseth, Kenneth Lovold] Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Rodseth, KL (通讯作者)，Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",klr@toi.no,,"Rodseth, Kenneth Lovold/0000-0002-4453-2231",,,,,30,7,7,2,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Offset projects sequestering carbon earn credits that can be traded on the Cap-and-Trade market to compensate for carbon emissions. The carbon stock embodied in harvested wood products can make up a substantial portion of the sequestered carbon in forest offset projects. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of the calculations for the number of credits allocated to a forest offset project in the California system. We also examine how alternative models for the decay of harvested wood products might better reflect the dynamics of both the lifetime and cascade chain progression of the products and how this might change the amount of credits earned. The results suggest improved data collection and refinement in methodology would help to improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty in a large and important carbon stock. We conclude with offering suggestions on how an understanding of the dependence of harvested wood product stocks on life cycle parameters might affect the economics of offset programs and assist targeted mitigation efforts.

The vector heterogeneous autoregressive index model has the property of generating a common index that preserves the same temporal cascade structure as in the HAR model, a feature that is not shared by other aggregation methods (e.g., principal components). The parameters of this model can be estimated easily by a proper switching algorithm that increases the Gaussian likelihood at each step. We illustrate our approach using an empirical analysis that aims to combine several realized volatility measures of the same equity index for three different markets.

We find mixed results. For one of the four fare changes the decline in ridership is greater in lower-income neighborhoods than it is in higher-income neighborhoods. However, the reverse is found for another fare increase. For two of the increases there is no relationship between income and ridership response. These mixed findings are in line with the prior literature that also found an inconsistent relationship. We hypothesize that there are two competing forces at work. On one hand lower-income groups are more constrained in their budget, but on the other hand they have fewer options for switching to other modes.","[Miller, Caroline] Allstate Insurance Co, 2675 Sanders Rd, Northbrook, IL 60062 USA; [Savage, Ian] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Savage, I (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",caroline.miller11@gmail.com; ipsavage@northwestern.edu,,"Savage, Ian/0000-0002-3742-4128",,,,,17,16,18,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

This paper uses Bell's disappointment metric to quantify its impact on individual decision-makers in a risky investment setting. We are able to quantify the sensitivity of disappointment to overconfidence. We examine disappointment in both deterministic and stochastic models, finding that in the most likely cases, individual investors experience lower disappointment when variance is higher. We are also able to quantify and compare calibration-based overconfidence and better-than-average overconfidence. Contrary to prior research, we find that their magnitudes are the same.

In its Leegin decision, the Supreme Court identified four ways in which RPM could be used to retard competition and consequently reduce consumer welfare: The first two involve the well-known concerns that RPM could be used to support either a manufacturer cartel or a dealer cartel; the last two involve unilateral conduct designed to foreclose entry or hinder smaller rivals.

I consider the effect of these rules and presumptions on economic efficiency, and highlight two forms of inefficiency associated with existing procedural law. First, suboptimal regulation of the inferential process increases the risk of false positives, a type of erroneous inference that is particularly problematic in the setting of collusion. I show that where existing procedural law allows the inference of collusive activity from the parallel conduct of firms, there is a risk that the trier of fact may infer anticompetitive conduct from factually neutral or procompetitive conduct. Second, I illustrate a different type of inefficiency that arises in competition law cases. Because evidential rules and presumptions have the potential to influence the behavior of firms in a collusive setting, overregulation of the inferential process has the potential to ameliorate the sustainability of a collusive equilibrium, undermining a key rationale of substantive competition law. I set out three specific areas of procedural law which exhibit these forms of inefficiencies, and argue for appropriate reformation of the law.","[Khoo, Kenneth] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Law, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Khoo, K (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Law, Singapore, Singapore.",kennethkhoo@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Nothing that Snowden has revealed was truly a secret, since several previous whistleblowers had reported, since 2002, about illegal mass surveillance of American citizens by the National Security Agency. Snowden's most striking difference from other NSA whistleblowers is the warm embrace from mainstream media, which has made him a celebrity. The 1998 theatrical film Enemy of the State contained the same sorts of revelations offered by Snowden, and imparts a number of messages to its audience about the security state that are strikingly similar to recurring messages in the Snowden Affair. Since that movie was made with assistance from the CIA these similarities are important to considering how authentic and socially useful his whistleblowing is.

Growth in life expectancy sharply departed from its trend after 1990, and then experienced a sharp acceleration after 2005. This latter acceleration was due overwhelmingly to improvements in HIV and malaria. Economists differ in their estimates of how large the structural effect of health on income is, with many estimates being relatively small. Taking seriously the delays built into many plausible causal channels would lead one to expect that any economic effects of these mortality changes, if they are detectable at all, will not appear for several decades. By contrast, the effect of declining mortality, especially from malaria, should soon be visible in data on population age structure in some countries.","[Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Weil, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",david_weil@brown.edu,,,,,,,12,3,3,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

This investigation rests on the differentiated knowledge base approach, which offers a clear distinction between analytical, synthetic and symbolic types of knowledge and deep insights into their idiosyncrasies. The introduction frames knowledge bases as theoretically discernible and differentiated forms of knowledge creation that are of particular relevance for innovation processes. The knowledge base approach goes beyond sector and regional approaches to innovation and focuses on micro-level dynamics of knowledge creation and knowledge combination within firms, industries and regions. This special issue offers theoretical advances and empirical insights into the causal linkages between such knowledge dynamics, innovation and new path development. It contributes to economic geography in providing an improved understanding of mechanism behind economic growth and development in various sectors and regions as well as to make better sense of the consistent heterogeneity of performance between firms within the same sectors and regions. All this underpins a broad-based innovation policy approach and an active role of policy makers in stimulating novel combinations of differentiated knowledge bases, which shows its roots in the (regional) innovation systems tradition.","[Asheim, Bjorn] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Asheim, Bjorn; Grillitsch, Markus] Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Trippl, Michaela] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",Universitetet i Stavanger; Lund University; University of Vienna,"Asheim, B (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.;Asheim, B (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",bjorn.t.asheim@uis.no; markus.grillitsch@keg.lu.se; michaela.trippl@univie.ac.at,"Grillitsch, Markus/AAS-9067-2021","Grillitsch, Markus/0000-0002-8406-4727",,,,,19,52,62,2,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Relationships at work are vital to foster engagement or disengagement. While the relational model by Kahn and Heaphy is conceptually appealing to explain work engagement, it lacks empirical support. Aims: The aims of this study were to investigate the associations among relational factors, psychological conditions (psychological meaningfulness, availability and safety) and work engagement and to test a structural model of work engagement. Setting: A total of 443 individuals in an agricultural research organisation participated in a cross-sectional study. Methods: Four scales that measured relational factors, the Psychological Conditions Scale and the Work Engagement Scale were administered. Latent variable modelling was used to test the measurement and structural models. Results: The results confirmed a structural model in which relational facets of job design contributed to psychological meaningfulness. Emotional exhaustion (inverse) and co-worker relationships contributed to psychological availability. Supervisor relationships contributed to psychological safety. Psychological meaningfulness and psychological availability contributed to work engagement, while emotional exhaustion contributed to disengagement. Conclusion: The relational context is an important target for intervention to affect the psychological conditions which precede work engagement. To promote work engagement, it is vital to focus on psychological meaningfulness, psychological availability and emotional exhaustion.","[Asiwe, Doris; Rothmann, Sebastiaan] North West Univ, Optentia Res Focus Area, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Jorgensen, Lene] North West Univ, WorkWell Res Unit, Sch Human Resource, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Hill, Carin] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Ind Psychol & People Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa; University of Johannesburg,"Rothmann, S (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Optentia Res Focus Area, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",ian@ianrothmann.com,"Rothmann, Sebastiaan/JGE-1766-2023; Rothmann, Sebastiaan/P-5291-2014; Graupner, Lené/IUN-3949-2023; Graupner, Lene Ilyna/O-7900-2016","Rothmann, Sebastiaan/0000-0001-6065-4338; Graupner, Lené/0000-0002-7604-9607; Hill, Carin/0000-0002-0297-9115",National Research Foundation,National Research Foundation,All the authors contributed equally.

His loss to the corrupt punter is more than made up for by enticing enough ordinary punters to bet on the losing team. This result is in sharp contrast to competitive bookmaking, where even contests have been shown to be immune to fixing. The analysis also reveals a surprising result that the incidence of match-fixing can dramatically fall when match-fixing opportunities rise. This is shown by comparing two scenarioswhen only one team is corruptible and when both are corruptible. For both teams corruptible, the bookmaker is uncertain about to which team the influential punter will have access, so carefully maneuvering the odds to induce match-fixing is too costly.","[Bag, Parimal Kanti] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, AS2 Level 6,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Saha, Bibhas] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",National University of Singapore; Durham University,"Bag, PK (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Arts & Social Sci, AS2 Level 6,1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",ecsbpk@nus.edu.sg; b.c.saha@durham.ac.uk,,,Singapore MOE AcRF [R-122-000-151-112],"Singapore MOE AcRF(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The project was partly funded by a Singapore MOE AcRF Tier 1 grant (grant no.

One of the most common problems with the costs of health care systems around the world is that they tend to increase expenditures at a rate that is greater than the rate of inflation. This has led to the introduction of visit fees by governments and/or public, private health care facilities and other health care providers. These fees are meant to rationalize the use of the health care system and slow the growth of health care expenditures. The Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic introduced from 1st January 2008 visit fees as a way to slow the growth of health care expenditures. On the contrary, total health care expenditures increased after the introduction of visit fees. A model of visits and visit intensity is developed, where visits and visit intensity are substitutes. The model shows that the demand for health care services will increase with an increase in the price of visits when the cross price elasticity of demand for visit intensity outweighs the own price elasticity of visits. The fees were abolished with the exception of fee for emergency room visit from 2015. The introduction of a visit fee is a counterproductive rationing device for health care services if it rations a component of overall health care services with a low own price elasticity of demand without rationing a substitute variable (visit intensity) with a higher cross elasticity of demand. Thus, the introduction of a visit fee may induce a sense of entitlement for further health care services per visit on the part of consumers, leading to an increase in overall health care expenditures.","[Clark, J.

The results imply that channels are interrelated and the broad credit channel is relatively stronger than the bank capital channel, while the relative importance of the bank capital channel is higher in peripheral than core euro area countries.","[Dajcman, Silvo] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia; [Tica, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Maribor; University of Zagreb,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@um.si; jtica@efzg.hr,"Tica, Josip/B-7628-2013","Tica, Josip/0000-0001-7937-1573",Slovenian Research Agency [P5-0023 (A)]; Croatian Science Foundation under programme Sustainability of Croatian Economic Policy and Development [IP-2013-11-7031],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Croatian Science Foundation under programme Sustainability of Croatian Economic Policy and Development,"This research has been supported by Slovenian Research Agency under the research core funding programme P5-0023 (A) and by the Croatian Science Foundation under the funding programme Sustainability of Croatian Economic Policy and Development, code IP-2013-11-7031, acronym SCrEPoDe.",,59,3,3,0,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

However, the empirical research conducted by practitioners to date does not provide convincing evidence of the effectiveness of emotional intelligence development interventions. Robust and informative research on the effectiveness of coaching to develop the emotional intelligence of leaders is lacking. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine, describe and evaluate the impact of a theoretically substantiated coaching intervention on the emotional and social intelligence competencies of leaders in a financial services company. Setting: The setting of the study is a financial services company in South Africa. Methods: A mixed method approach using a quantitative and qualitative research design was considered appropriate. The quantitative research method consisted of a quasi-experimental design using a non-equivalent pre-and post test control group to measure the impact of the coaching intervention on a sample of 30 leaders. The Bar-On EQ-i scale was selected as a reliable and valid measure of emotional and social intelligence competencies. Wilcoxon's statistic was calculated to determine the statistical significance of score differences between the experimental (N = 30) and control (N = 30) groups. The qualitative research method was comprised of semi-structured interviews with six of the leaders and their supervisors. Results: The statistical results indicated that coaching significantly impacted the emotional and social intelligence competencies of leaders in terms of their overall emotional quotient (EQ), intrapersonal competency, interpersonal skills, stress management, self-regard and empathy. The semi-structured interviews provided rich descriptive themes and evaluations that corroborated the quantitative findings. Conclusion: This research provided convincing empirical evidence of the positive impact of a long-term, spaced and goal-focused coaching intervention on the emotional and social intelligence competencies of leaders in a financial services institution. The finding suggests that a theoretically well substantiated coaching intervention and a robust empirical study can be effective in demonstrating the impact of coaching on the emotional and social intelligence competencies of leaders. However, the implications of the limitations pointed out in this study could have influenced the findings, and future research aimed at improving relevant research models should take these into account.","[Dippenaar, Marlene; Schaap, Pieter] Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Schaap, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Pretoria, South Africa.",pieter.schaap@up.ac.za,,"Schaap, Pieter/0000-0002-8293-5787",,,,,78,8,27,0,38,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this paper, we analyse the usefulness of data collected from automated teller machines (ATM) and points-of-sale (POS) for nowcasting and forecasting quarterly private consumption. We take advantage of the availability of such high frequency data by using mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regressions. A comparison of several MIDAS variants proposed in the literature is conducted, and both single- and multi-variable models are considered, together with different information sets within the quarter. Given the substantial use of ATM/POS technology in Portugal, it is important to assess the information content of this data for tracking private consumption. We find that ATM/POS data display a better forecast performance than typical indicators, which reinforces the potential usefulness of this novel type of data among policymakers and practitioners.

Effective management cannot operate without effective control. Both practice and empirical research suggest that the investments managed within a chosen supervisory framework achieve significantly better results than those implemented without supervisory approaches and frameworks. Firstly, this paper provides an evaluation of the status of investments in logistics as reflected in professional literature. With the literature review, the authors sought to identify current trends of investments in logistics. The statistics of manuscripts' content revealed how authors view and are aware of the topic of investments in logistics. Secondly, the article presents a survey carried out in organisations regarding their governance of logistics investments, whose results reveal important information needed to assess the actual current state of the topic and serve as a starting point of formulating insights in the field. The main finding is that in this area, no useful framework, standard or tool is being used to manage these investments. Furthermore, it has become evident that the companies face lack of knowledge and awareness of their importance. The survey results also show that, in the terms of investments in logistics, there is much room for further development, innovation and change of existing practices. Finally, a framework for managing investments in logistics called ValLog, is proposed. It is based on the Val IT framework, which provides approaches needed to successfully manage IT investments. The authors consider that Val IT can be adapted in a manner where its structure is kept intact, but the IT-specific parts are adequately adapted to the field of logistics. The authors believe that this will provide an appropriate framework for managing investments in logistics.","[Jereb, Borut] Univ Maribor, Fac Logist, Mariborska 7, Celje 3000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Jereb, B (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Logist, Mariborska 7, Celje 3000, Slovenia.",borutjereb@um.si,"Jereb, Borut/E-1150-2017","Jereb, Borut/0000-0001-5104-0852",,,,,66,6,6,3,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

When controlling for endogeneity bias and the embeddedness of existing Chinese economic activity, we find that the importance of overseas communities in the location choices of Chinese firms is based on increased access to strategic information. Our results confirm that the relationship between the size of an overseas Chinese community and the probability of Chinese investment is stronger for communities hosting newer generations of Chinese migrants; in addition, they partially corroborate that this relationship is stronger when the education level of the community's Chinese migrants is higher.

As part of the research we used a specially designed model of balance-sheet analysis for BAMF municipal companies. Used on a sample of 14 regional providers of emergency medical services in the Czech Republic from 2010-2014, we assessed the level and variability of the aggregate financial health indicator BAMF and its components, five sub-indicators. It turns out that the financial health of these subjects, although displaying significant similarities are not free of extreme values that in practice require more attention, or more precisely, deeper analysis. The authors conclude that the model is relatively easy to apply in practice and can contribute to the better financial health management of public sector bodies.

Behavioral economics is the whole science dedicated to examining this phenomenon. Freud has constructed the model that reveals the inner motivators for decisions, including the purchasing one as well. However, behavioral models are not solely enough as the practice has proved that consumers' brains are much more complex than it has been thought. There is always a good chance that habits will fail. Inconsistencies in the way consumer process information will be undone due to the presence of emotions. That is highly consistent with the fact that humans are not rational creatures meaning they are not governed solely by reason in any decision making process. This gives the ground for more enhanced research on decision making and introduction of the neurological aspects. Skeptical or not, currently there are inventions of the neural-economics combination that tend to be widely spread. Another suggestion in favor of neuroeconomics is that when used in different direction, it can lead to the search and choice of an appropriate empirical model.","[Krajina, Anida; Karalic, Vildana] Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Krajina, A (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Corp Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",anida.krajina@gmail.com; karalic.vildana@gmail.com,,"Rajapakse, Anida/0000-0001-8932-3428",Masaryk University [MUNI/A/1021/2015],Masaryk University,The study is a result of a research project Behavioral-economic experiments in marketing and management (MUNI/A/1021/2015) which had been funded by Masaryk University.,,16,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-54112-9; 978-3-319-54111-2,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,7.0,,,,,,391,400,,10.1007/978-3-319-54112-9_25,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ4CE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424822700025,0

The comparative analysis involved both practical applicability aspects and formal evaluation of statistical properties of the tests.

Changing contribution of inflation expectations and expected real interest rates to the long-term interest rates determination (Kim and Orphanides, 2012) are one of the most important implications of the recent deflationary periods in the Euro Area. In the paper we employ SVAR methodology to identify inflation expectations and expected real interest rates shocks and calculate variance decomposition and impulse-response functions of long-term nominal interest rates in the new Euro Area member countries.

The investigation is based on data collected within a survey conducted among a sample of 1,449 Romanian retail banking customers, based on a questionnaire including a specific set of items drawn up from the literature, intended to reflect corporate brand loyalty, as well as perceptual CSR dimensions, from a sustainable development and stakeholder-based perspective. After an exploratory factor analysis, the observed variables were grouped into several latent variables regarding perceived CSR and brand loyalty and, further on, these were included into a multiple regression model which was tested comparatively within various sample groups generated based on consumer demographics variables. The results emphasize several significant dissimilarities between gender, age, education and residence type based consumer segments in what concerns the impact of various CSR dimensions, as perceived by customers, on brand loyalty towards corporate brands in the banking sector. Thus, brand loyalty is significantly influenced by: perceived responsibility towards the environment - only in the case of female, younger and/or higher educated customers; perceived responsibility towards public authorities - only in the case of customers who are male, older, less educated and/or residing in larger cities; by perceived responsibility towards shareholders - only when for customers who are older, higher educated and/or residing in larger cities. The findings have practical implications for enhancing corporate brand loyalty in the regional retail banking sector market by outlining those CSR policies, actions and attitudes which should have priority within local banks' marketing communications.","[Moisescu, Ovidiu-Ioan] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Gica, Oana-Adriana] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Business, Dept Hospitality Serv, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Moisescu, OI (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Mkt, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ovidiu.moisescu@econ.ubbcluj.ro; oana.gica@tbs.ubbcluj.ro,"Gica, Oana/AAS-6168-2021; Gica, Oana Adriana/AAX-9359-2020; Moisescu, Ovidiu I./C-1175-2013","Gica, Oana/0000-0001-7958-1036; Gica, Oana Adriana/0000-0001-7958-1036; Moisescu, Ovidiu I./0000-0003-0097-5660",,,,,51,6,6,3,31,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Therefore, this study leverages both theory and data from face-to-face interviews, while considering three selected handicraft firms from various study perspectives. Both parts of the analysis shed light on the informal and formal paths that firms take to generate innovation and achieve new-product development and changes. The study looks at the impact of other factors on firm-level innovation by examining both the internal and external factors that lead firms to diversify their product offerings, upgrade their processes, transfer knowledge and access global production networks.

Over the past years, we have questioned the possibility of creating new models of health care organization, able to respond to the demand for health care with new management tools to develop, implement and spread both the public and private healthcare system. The model focused on public control of health over the years has always been more trouble in responding to the demand for health care in increasingly complex social contexts. There is a need to innovate with new management tools to be disseminated both the public health and the private sector. The ways to contain health care expenditure, normally involve a decrease in the quality of services. Some of the measures are commonly adopted patient co-pay schemes, or practicing de-facto rationing, either by limiting the number of actual treatments provided in combination with long waiting lists, or carrying out consumer health campaigns focused on prevention, all with the aim of limiting the demand for public health services. The low cost high value in health care can be an answer at this stage of welfare change. In the research the case study method is used and it's focused on two low cost high value medical centers: Centro Medico Santagostino and OdontoSalute, located in Northern Italy. The cross-case analysis is used to identify the specific features of the low cost high value business model and the contribution to the health system. This study demonstrated that the low cost high value business model in health care system is a solution to the welfare change. The need of more systematic studies in this area is highlighted.","[Querci, Elena; Gazzola, Patrizia] Univ Insubria, Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Gazzola, P (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Varese, Italy.",patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-54885-2; 978-3-319-54884-5,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,235,246,,10.1007/978-3-319-54885-2_22,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI5UA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412819500022,0

The paper is an annual update of former presented papers representing a long-term study analyzing the evolution of the globalization phenomenon. The entropy-based metrics used to compute the interweavement of trade flows is based on a Boltzmann derived concept of entropy, i.e., the higher the order (high inequality) the lower the entropy, leading to a new defined statistical entropy. Translated to economy: the higher the inequality (high concentration of flows) the lower the entropy, i.e., the lower the globalization degree resulting in a higher risk of the economic system. Former papers have shown that economic world trade, as a whole, has been globalizing during recent years but with different patterns: de-globalizing for advanced economic regions, such as North America and Europe, and globalizing for emerging economic regions. Furthermore, it shows that globalization or de-globalization, intended as interweavement of flows, is not a result of the absolute trade volume but of the growth rate of trade volume. The Globalization Trade Model with globalization type 1a of commodities, globalization type 1b of specialties, and opportunistic low-cost globalization type 1c gives an explanation for the different regional evolutions. At the beginning of economic development, globalization is governed by the H-O resource endowment trade logic complying with complementary needs of economic regions, spreading trade flows to new destinations, whereas advanced economies are concentrating on preferential destinations, following Linder's trade model based on similar consumption patterns. However, after the financial crisis of 2008, during the last years, the evolution of world trade has been stagnating. Is the globalization of trade coming to an end? The aggregated result seems to confirm inverse Kuznets evolution of globalization, explainable with the Central Theorem of Globalization and the Maximizing-Value-Net-of-Risk globalization logic.","[Ruttimann, Bruno G.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inspire AG, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Rüttimann, BG (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inspire AG, Zurich, Switzerland.",bruno.ruettimann@inspire.ethz.ch,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-48454-9; 978-3-319-48453-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,465,486,,10.1007/978-3-319-48454-9_31,0.0,,,22,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1MX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447881400031,0

The European Union membership of some CEE countries increased, in average, the number of the UK immigrants by 12 times in the period 2004-2014 compared to the group of countries formed by Russia and Ukraine. The empirical findings show positive economic effects of immigration on the UK's economy, even if the pro Brexit group claimed that a control of immigration is necessary. CEE countries emigrants stimulated the UK economic growth, price stability and reduced the homicide rate. The effects of immigration on the unemployment rate, health and education spending were positive, but very low. According to mixed-effects Poisson models estimations, after Brexit the number of the UK immigrants from the CEE countries that are member of the EU might decrease by 2 times. This significant decline in immigration might impose austerity measures, because of the fall in the economic growth trend with negative impact on the UK economy. Therefore, we recommend policies that focus more on high-skilled labour force than on the reduction of the number of immigrants. The UK should propose measures to slow the expected immigration decline in order to alleviate economic issues like decline in economic growth, decrease in labour productivity, cutting backs on public services.","[Simionescu, Mihaela] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Bilan, Yuriy] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Management & Econ, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Smrcka, Lubos] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vincurova, Zuzana] Pan European Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Bratislava, Slovakia",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Tomas Bata University Zlin; Prague University of Economics & Business; Pan-European University,"Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",mihaela_mb1@yahoo.com; yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk; smrckal@vse.cz; Zuzana.vincurova@paneurouni.com,"Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016","Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172",,,,,75,17,18,0,37,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Starting with the first mention of emotional intelligence in the doctoral thesis of Wayne Payne in 1985 and moving forward to the well known models developed by the researchers as K. V. Petrides (2001) Mayer and Salovey (2001) and Daniel Goleman (1995), this subject has been well studied and debated. This research is following the model of K. V. Petrides, the Trait model, and is also developing a method of measuring job satisfaction in accordance with emotional intelligence. The instrument presented here starts from combining the current models of job satisfaction with the Trait model of emotional intelligence, using the same scale as Petrides used for his TEIQue. This research method is developed in order to measure the level of emotional intelligence of university professors and the job satisfaction level in accordance with the emotional intelligence that students are proving. The objective of this study is to verify the research metod developed, and its utility. The hipothesis of this research are: a)professors with high levels of emotional intelligence are more satisfied about their jobs; b) students with high levels of emotional intelligence are more satisfied about their professors and the learning environment. The respondents involved in this research are professors working for one of the most prestigious Universities in Romania, Bucharest University of Economic Studies and their students. The results of this study lead the major research on a new level of investigating the connections between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction within the student-professor relationship.","[Tudor, Monica] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tudor, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",monica.tudor89@gmail.com,"Triculescu, Monica/AAO-7076-2021","Triculescu, Monica/0000-0002-4933-2634",,,,,22,0,1,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2286-1440,,,INT MANAGE CONF,,,2017,,,,,,,756,765,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466917100078,0

Moreover the effect of negative word-of-mouth is more pronounced for experience products than for search products, and less popular products are more vulnerable while big brands are immune.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the economic impacts of two proposed conservation area scenarios in the Lower Peace Region of Alberta to determine the potential magnitude of the economic trade-offs. The first scenario, known as the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan (LARP), was proposed by the Government of Alberta under the Alberta Land-use Framework. The second scenario, referred to as the alternative scenario, was developed by the authors using a spatial land-use rationalization process. Economic impacts of each conservation area scenario were estimated using a dynamic, computable general equilibrium model for the province of Alberta. Results indicated that the two scenarios will have very similar impacts and may reduce the present value of GDP by as much as $4.44 billion in Alberta from 2011-2056. These findings highlight the importance of considering the economic impacts of conservation area strategies in order to minimize the trade-offs associated with achieving conservation goals.","[Lantz, V.

The findings show that theoretical derivations along are not sufficient to completely identify the impacts of changes in variables on the profitability of carriers. By contrast, empirical results of this study show that the impacts on the carriers' profits are significantly positive with respect to regional economic growth, individual fleet expansion and technological progress, but significantly negative with respect to the expansion of regional fleet capacity and soaring fuel prices. Unexpectedly, growing vessel size brings an insignificant negative effect to the profitability of carriers. According to the implications derived from the theoretical model and empirical study, this study also suggests that quantity-oriented rather than price oriented strategies will be more effective to improve the profitability of carriers. Emphasizing the effect of shipping alliances on market reactions to freight rate changes and on the improved chances to realize scale economies of larger ships, this paper also provides justification of government regulatory policies granting limited antitrust immunity for container shipping lines.","[Wu, Wei-Ming] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Logist Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Huang, Deng-Shing] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Wu, WM (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Logist Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",wwu@nkfust.edu.tw; dhuang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,NSC in Taiwan (National Science Council of Taiwan) [NSC 100-2410-H-327-028],NSC in Taiwan (National Science Council of Taiwan),This study is supported by the research grant from NSC in Taiwan (National Science Council of Taiwan): NSC 100-2410-H-327-028.,,23,6,6,3,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

To provide an answer, the authors conducted 227 semi-structured interviews with transportation and electricity experts from over 200 institutions across the Nordic region. Results show that there is an extensive range of benefits for both EVs and V2G, with experts suggesting 29 and 25 categories of benefits for EVs and V2G, respectively. Though the experts covered the obvious benefits of economic savings, emissions, and renewable energy integration, several other novel benefits were identified. The second and third most common discussed EV benefit was noise reduction and better performance, which are typically not widely discussed. Similarly, we find that V2G benefits covered topics like vehicle-to-home and solar integration, as well as more novel benefits, like vehicle-to-telescope and emergency power backup.

Our inquiry spotlights an approach recently embraced by some courts benchmarking fair value against the merger price itself. We show that the merger price deference effectively nullifies the role that appraisal can potentially play in establishing a de facto reserve price for company auctions, thereby depressing both acquisition prices and target shareholders' expected welfare relative to both the optimal appraisal policy and a variety of other valuation measures. We also examine conditions under which deference to the merger price may nonetheless be defensible on economic grounds. Our results have empirical implications for understanding appraisal, and they likewise help to inform doctrine by providing guidance to legal actors about when a sales process can be considered sufficiently robust to justify deal price deference.","[Choi, Albert H.] Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Talley, Eric] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY USA",University of Virginia; Columbia University,"Choi, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",achoi@law.virginia.edu; etalley@law.columbia.edu,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

When I segment the market by brand, I observe that the estimates are sensitive to how brands are separated into different types. These findings show that the market is more clearly segmented by service level than by brand type and also highlight the importance of product differentiation when modeling price dispersion.","[Kim, Taehwan] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 118 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kim, T (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 118 Profess Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",tkim@mail.missouri.edu,,,,,,,29,2,2,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

For example, despite that half of SADC countries are low middle income (as opposed to low income), high inequality implies that many people in the region still live in poverty. While literature is replete with theories linking low incomes to population growth and savings, empirical evidence is context specific and often mixed. Aim: There is a dearth of strong empirical evidence that shows empirical linkages between population growth rates, incomes and savings in the SADC and this article aims to investigate these linkages. Specifically, the aim is to empirically understand the impact of population growth, savings and investment in human capital, on incomes. Setting: We focus our investigation on the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), which comprises 16 countries namely, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and Comoros. Methods: To achieve the goals of this study, we analyse data from 1977 to 2014 obtained from the World Bank databases and use ordinary least squares, fixed effects, random effects and Arellano-Bond dynamic panel-data estimation techniques to investigate the relationships between incomes, population growth and savings. Results: Our findings support the existence of a negative relationship between high population growth rates and income per capita, as well as a positive relationship between capital accumulation (human capital), savings and income per capita growth. Shares of savings in relation to gross domestic product (GDP) of countries in the SADC stand at under 16% of GDP (compared to shares of over 30% in developed countries) and are particularly worrisome. Conclusion: There is a case for a concerted effort by the SADC Member States to control population growth, encourage schooling and, further, encourage a 'savings culture' in order for the SADC region to achieve its aspirations of eradicating poverty and hunger as outlined in Agenda 2063 and even the Sustainable Development Goals.","[Matchaya, Greenwell; Nhemachena, Charles; Nhlengenthwa, Sibusiso] Int Water Management Inst, Pretoria, South Africa",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Matchaya, G (通讯作者)，Int Water Management Inst, Pretoria, South Africa.",g.matchaya@cgiar.org,,,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; United States Agency for the International Development (USAID); International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); United States Agency for the International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)(CGIAR); Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program,"We are grateful to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the United States Agency for the International Development (USAID) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) who supported the researchers with funding for various activities in support of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, one of which led to this article.",,14,0,0,1,9,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Using this approach, we empirically investigate the (de) regulatory reform initiated in the Turkish airline industry during the 2000s. As an estimation methodology, we employ cointegration test in the presence of structural breaks to account for the effect of (de) regulatory changes. Cointegration test confirms the existence of a long-run relationship among deregulation, prices, and the number of passengers carried by airlines. The analysis of structural breaks suggests that deregulation impacts on prices and the number of passengers through actual competition and the increased accessibility of air travel, respectively.","[Cetin, Tamer] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Eryigit, Kadir Y.] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Eryigit, Kadir Y.] Uludag Univ, Bursa, Turkey",Northeastern University; University of Otago; Uludag University,"Çetin, T (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Eryigit, KY (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.;Eryigit, KY (通讯作者)，Uludag Univ, Bursa, Turkey.",,"Eryiğit, Kadir Y./AAH-1618-2021",,,,,,48,0,0,3,9,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

The model incorporates both constrained and unconstrained labor supply. Panel data methods are adapted to accommodate unobserved heterogeneity and multinomial selection into six mutually exclusive labor supply regimes. We estimate the wage and income elasticities arising from selection and unobserved heterogeneity as well as from the Stone-Geary Slutsky equations. The labor supply model is estimated with data from the British Household Panel Survey 1991-2008. Among dual job holders, our study finds that the Stone-Geary income and wage elasticities are much larger for labor supply to the second job compared with the main job. When the effects of selection and unobserved heterogeneity are taken account of, the magnitudes of these elasticities on the second job tend to be significantly reduced.","[Choe, Chung] Hanyang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, ERICA Campus,55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Oaxaca, Ronald L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, McClelland Hall 401,POB 210108, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Renna, Francesco] Univ Akron, Dept Econ, CBA 324, Akron, OH 44325 USA",Hanyang University; University of Arizona; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Renna, F (通讯作者)，Univ Akron, Dept Econ, CBA 324, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",choechung@hanyang.ac.kr; rlo@email.arizona.edu; frenna@uakron.edu,"; Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","renna, francesco/0000-0001-6357-8377; Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A8014290],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We thank three anonymous referees for comments that greatly improved the paper.

Liberalisation has shown deep consequences not only on the coach market structure, historically rather static and with limited market share, but also in the general market of long-distance passenger transport. In this context Italy is an interesting case, presenting some peculiarities with respect to comparable countries such as France and Germany. Italian market in fact had a relevant dimension even before liberalisation, but was concentrated on marginal origin-destination relationships. The liberalisation has pushed coach companies, mostly newcomers, to look at the richer intercity markets, especially in Northern Italy. Thanks to a 1-year long database of prices for most of Italian domestic routes, the paper studies the price determinants, including the strategy of main companies and the effect of intermodal competition. Results show that newcomers' strategy is relatively more aggressive than incumbents' one, but also that some of the largest historical operators also effectively reduce average route prices with promotions and yield management. Also intermodal competition matters. Routes overlapping with rail PSO are priced less, but interestingly this happens also for high-speed routes. This shows that the two markets are not independent.","[Beria, Paolo; Nistri, Dario] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies DASTU, Via Bonardi 3, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Laurino, Antonio] Piazza Minniti, I-20159 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Beria, P (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies DASTU, Via Bonardi 3, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",paolo.beria@polimi.it; dario.nistri@polimi.it; antoniolaurino@gmail.com,"Beria, Paolo/A-9439-2010","Beria, Paolo/0000-0001-5171-6576",,,,,25,10,10,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

They are looking for ways in which a mobility data platform gathers the relevant data, allow for advanced modelling of current and future network states, and ways to drive travel behaviour. We participated in the EU funded PETRA project that built such a platform for the cities of Haifa, Rome and Venice. In this paper, we are looking for key governance mechanisms that affect the success of mobility data platforms, and how they are related to technical features. The project and an additional study into 10 cases revealed that the more ambitious a platform is on a technical level, the more governance challenges they will encounter, thus the more advanced governance arrangements are necessary. However, many governance arrangements are a given rather than a subject to design. This implies that for success, the technical ambition of the platform should be aligned with the institutions of the city in which the platforms will be implemented.","[Veeneman, Wijnand; van der Voort, Haiko; Hirschhorn, Fabio; Steenhuisen, Bauke; Klievink, Bram] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Veeneman, W (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, POB 5015, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",W.W.Veeneman@tudelft.nl; H.G.vanderVoort@TUDelft.nl; F.Hirschhorn@TUDelft.nl; B.M.Steenhuisen@TUDelft.nl; A.J.Klievink@TUDelft.nl,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019; Veeneman, Wijnand/AAD-5722-2020","Veeneman, Wijnand/0000-0002-8507-2286; Klievink, Bram/0000-0003-1999-743X; Hirschhorn, Fabio/0000-0002-2017-3991",European Union FP 7 programme,European Union FP 7 programme(European Union (EU)),This research was carried out with support from the European Union FP 7 programme.,,17,9,9,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

A bootstrapping approach is further applied to compute confidence intervals for each decomposed factor of TFP. The findings show a 1.7% average decline of TFP, annually. However, a substantial variation between years can be observed in the number of statistically significant courts below and above unity. The averages of the components show that the negative impact is mainly driven by negative technical change. Large variations are also observed over time where the small courts have the largest volatility. Two recommendations are: (1) that district courts with negative TFP growth could learn from those with positive TFP growth; and (2) that the back-up labour force could be developed to enhance flexibility.","[Mattsson, Pontus; Mansson, Jonas] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden; [Mansson, Jonas; Andersson, Christian; Bonander, Fredrik] SNAO, Nybrogatan 55, S-11490 Stockholm, Sweden; [Mansson, Jonas] Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Ctr Efficiency & Prod Anal, Bangkok, Thailand",Linnaeus University; Thammasat University,"Månsson, J (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.;Månsson, J (通讯作者)，SNAO, Nybrogatan 55, S-11490 Stockholm, Sweden.;Månsson, J (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Thammasat Ctr Efficiency & Prod Anal, Bangkok, Thailand.",pontus.mattsson@lnu.se; jonas.mansson@lnu.se; christian.andersson@riksrevisionen.se; fredrik.bonander@riksrevisionen.se,,"Mansson, Jonas/0000-0001-9078-0511",,,,,101,12,12,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper evaluates the coordinated development of these three benefits taking four Chinese autonomous municipalities as examples. These four cities have large-scale urban public transportation infrastructure but its basic function has not been fully played. Whether these three benefits of urban public transportation infrastructure have been developed in harmony or not was unclear. We analyzed the coordinated development among three benefits by constructing coupling coordination degree model and studied the impacts of three benefits on their coordinated development level using panel regression model. The result showed that the coordinated development levels of three benefits of urban public transportation infrastructure were lower in these four cities and the impact of economic benefit on their coordinated development level was largest and social benefit insignificant. It was highly related with the development strategies and construction levels of urban public transportation infrastructure in these four cities. Three policy implications were put forward to the improvement of coordinated development level of three benefits of urban public transportation infrastructure.","[Sun, Yu; Cui, Yin] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yu] Tianjin Univ Commerce, Sch Publ Adm, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University of Commerce,"Cui, Y (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",sunyuyao@163.com; cuiyin@tju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Fund Project [71273186],National Natural Science Fund Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The research was supported by the National Natural Science Fund Project in 2012, Project approval no. 71273186.",,62,96,109,28,172,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The first method defines three scenarios in terms of the expected returns under the scenarios and assumes a Markov chain governing the occurrence of the scenarios over time. It employs predictive quantile regressions of excess return on a predictor for three quantiles to estimate the occurrence of the scenarios over an in-sample period and the transition probabilities of the Markov chain, predicts the expected returns under the scenarios, and generates an equity premium forecast by combining the predicted expected returns under three scenarios with the estimated transition probabilities. The second method generates an equity premium forecast by combining the individual forecasts from the first method across all predictors. For most of predictors, the first method outperforms the benchmark method of historical average and the traditional predictive linear regression with a single predictor both statistically and economically, and the second method consistently performs better than several competing methods used in the literature. The performance of our methods is further examined under different scenarios and economic conditions, and is robust for two different out-of-sample periods and specifications of the scenarios.","[Tang, Xiaoxiao] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO USA; [Hu, Feifang] George Washington Univ, Dept Stat, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Wang, Peiming] Auckland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Washington University (WUSTL); George Washington University; Auckland University of Technology,"Wang, PM (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",peiming.wang@aut.ac.nz,,"Wang, Peiming/0000-0002-1386-5746",National Science Foundation (USA) [DMS-1612970],National Science Foundation (USA)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"National Science Foundation (USA), Grant/Award Number: DMS-1612970",,21,1,1,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

In this paper, we use data from the 1992 to 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study to identify a broad set of pivotal events in the lives of adult children. First, we determine whether these events affect subsequent financial transfers from parents to children over multiple years. Next, we determine whether those events that result in subsequent transfers also shift parental retirement expectations. Finally, we quantify the impact of the unexpected children's events on retirement realizations, moving beyond the correlational analyses in prior literature. Our findings show that a child's move out of a parental home decreases both expectations and realizations of working after age 65. The magnitude of this effect is similar to that of an own health shock experienced during pre-retirement years.","[Miller, Marina] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Miller, Marina] Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA; [Reznik, Gayle L.] Social Secur Adm, Off Retirement Policy, Washington, DC USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Congressional Budget Office,"Miller, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Miller, M (通讯作者)，Congress Budget Off, Washington, DC 20515 USA.",marina.miller015@gmail.com,,"Tamborini, Christopher/0000-0002-8198-3509",,,,,20,4,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The efficient measurement of these variables is essential to the management thereof. It is within this context that the Brief Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (BCEAI) was developed. Shorter instruments seem to be favoured by researchers and practitioners alike. However, little is known about the psychometric properties of the BCEAI, particularly regarding measurement invariance. Aim: This study seeks to address the structural validity and measurement invariance for the BCEAI applied for men and women. The objective was to establish the utility of the instrument within the South African context, with specific emphasis on cross-gender comparisons. Setting: Medium to large South African organisations, with more than 60 employees, were targeted for inclusion in the study. Once organisations indicated their willingness to participate, 60 employees per organisation were randomly selected to participate in the study. Methods: Data on the BCEAI were captured and pairwise multi-group confirmatory factor analyses with robust maximum likelihood estimation were used to examine four levels of measurement invariance, as well as the equivalence of latent means pertaining to male and female respondents. Results: Data were collected from 3180 employees representing 52 South African organisations. The results support the structural validity of the BCEAI and demonstrate strict measurement invariance for the BCEAI across gender. Equivalence of latent means across gender was also supported. Conclusion: These results reveal that the BCEAI mirrors the structure of the original instrument in the South African context and that BCEAI yields psychometrically equivalent scores among employees of both genders. Researchers and practitioners can therefore use the BCEAI with the knowledge that its theoretical structure is sound and can apply it with confidence when comparing male and female employees in the workplace.","[Steyn, Renier] Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa; [de Bruin, G.

Setting: The research strategy and methodology examined trends in theory building over a 52-year period (1962-2014). Method: An archival review of the published literature was conducted and each article was examined to identify the general research method employed. The chi-square test was used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more of four categories. Results: The archival data indicate that articles published over the past 52 years in major international and South African journals are skewed towards quantitative and conceptual research. This implies that researchers in leadership studies employed qualitative and mixed methodologies in their work less often than quantitative and conceptual methodologies. Conclusion: This trend has implications for the development of leadership-followership research. Research methods should be used with mindfulness, with qualitative methods being used to observe social and human problems, followed by quantitative methods to test inductively formulated followership theories. It is particularly important, in the context of diverse cultures, to note that local attempts to formulate authentic theory development will remain difficult and unsuccessful until endogenous management systems are established and institutionalised. This is very important for scholars who believe that an affinity for qualitative methodology affords the opportunity for emic research rather than merely for testing theories and constructs that may not capture local followership phenomena.","[Feldman, Joseph A.] Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Feldman, JA (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, Pretoria, South Africa.",feldmja@unisa.ac.za,,,,,,,57,0,2,1,16,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

In this paper, we provide evidence that the two classes of measures typically used in the literature, the number of new marriages per population and the share of individuals currently or ever married within an age range, generally lead to misleading inference when used to study the probability someone marries during his or her life or fertile life, how it evolves, and how it differs across populations. An alternative measure, the share of individuals ever married in a given cohort by a given age, is better suited for such studies. When researchers are interested in year-on-year changes in marriage probabilities of singles, age-specific marriage hazards are more reliable than population-based measures. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for studies of the drivers and consequences of marriage formation.","[Bronson, Mary Ann] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Mazzocco, Maurizio] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",Georgetown University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Bronson, MA (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Intercultural Ctr 580,37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mary.ann.bronson@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,0,1,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Using a methodology that does not require having actual cost data to draw inference on cost changes associated with improvement in OTP, we analyze airlines' optimal OTP-improvement investment choice. The modeling framework allows us to provide estimates of OTP-related marginal investment costs per minute of improvement necessary to achieve specific percent reductions in arrival delay minutes from the current levels of arrival delay minutes observed in the data.","[Gayle, Philip G.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 322 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Yimga, Jules O.] Embry Riddle Aeronaut Univ, Sch Business, 3700 Willow Creek Rd, Prescott, AZ 86301 USA",Kansas State University; Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,"Gayle, PG (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 322 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",gaylep@ksu.edu; jules.yimga@erau.edu,,"Yimga, Jules/0000-0001-5424-616X",,,,,39,30,32,2,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0122,2212-0130,,ECON TRANSP,Econ.

Method: In the absence of a standard measure, a financial literacy index was constructed for the country using data collected on attitudes (towards), access to and use of financial services over the period 2005-2009. In a multivariate regression analysis, we used the index to examine the extent to which differences in financial literacy correlate with demographic and economic characteristics. Results: The index revealed substantial variation in financial literacy by age, education, province and race.

There are totally 77 studies selected as the core literature sample according to a five-step approach. The results from literature review show evidences in favor of the important roles played by governmental organizations and port organizations as the main governing bodies of port governance. Furthermore, our analysis shows first, that multilevel governance has become a notable feature of port governance. Second, there are increasing involvements by national or regional levels of government in some countries such as the USA, Brazil, China. Third, port authorities at local level are generally holding the centre-stage position with further autonomy in managing port operations. Fourth, not-for-profit organizations related to port activities play the role of coordinators in port governance. Finally, different governance regimes with different specific governing actors for different port classifications can be identified for many nations. This study shows that fundamentally institutional arrangements and specific port activities are the two basic categories of what is governed. The institutional arrangements determine the port governance configuration and allocation of responsibilities of port activities. There are 12 groups of specific port activities within five categories identified in port governance.","[Zhang, Qiang; Chen, Shun] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Geerlings, Harry] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Smart Port, Erasmus Sch Social & Behav Sci, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [El Makhloufi, Abdel] Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Res Programme Urban Technol, Smart Mobil & Logist, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands",Shanghai Maritime University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Zhang, Q (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",qiangzhang@shmtu.edu.cn,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019; Makhloufi, Abdel El/B-5798-2011","Makhloufi, Abdel El/0000-0001-8639-4781","Shanghai Social Science Funding for Young Talents Program [2016EGL005]; Chinese Nation Natural Foundation Projects [71774109, 71704103]",Shanghai Social Science Funding for Young Talents Program; Chinese Nation Natural Foundation Projects,This study is supported by the Shanghai Social Science Funding for Young Talents Program (2016EGL005) and Chinese Nation Natural Foundation Projects (71774109 and 71704103).,,58,21,24,6,47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The poor performance of public organisations has necessitated privatisation of these organisations. Aim: This article explored management perceptions regarding factors impacting the privatisation of parastatals in a developing country, namely Zimbabwe. Setting and method: A comprehensive literature study provided the theoretical framework for this research. Primary data were collected by means of a survey obtaining 301 self-administered structured questionnaires from 27 parastatals in Zimbabwe. Seven null-hypotheses were tested using advanced statistical techniques such as regression and correlation analyses. Results and conclusions: Factors identified in this study that could impact privatisation of parastatals in Zimbabwe are stakeholder consultation, stable macroeconomic conditions, government transparency and a well-developed privatisation process plan. If privatisation is implemented effectively, it could lead to increased organisational performance, effective governance and economic empowerment. It also appeared that variables such as union consultation, role ambiguity, political intervention, attractiveness to foreign investment and government commitment do not exert a significant influence on perceptions of privatisation.

J,"de Lange, S; van Wyk, D",,,,"de Lange, Silke; van Wyk, Danielle",,,Exploring the South African tax consequences of a residential property lottery,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Background: Disposing of a residential property by way of a lottery sounds peculiar, but a number of these transactions relating to residential properties in South Africa have recently taken place. As this is not an ordinary way of disposing of and acquiring residential property, it is submitted that it is necessary to explore the tax consequences resulting from such a transaction. Aim: The objective of this article is to explore some of the most pertinent South African tax consequences of such a residential property lottery transaction, from the viewpoint of the owner ('seller') who disposes of the residential property and the winner ('purchaser') who acquires the residential property in terms of the lottery. Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African income tax environment to explore the tax consequences resulting from a disposal and acquisition of residential property by way of a lottery. Methods: A non-empirical study, which entails the study of the various South African tax provisions and an application thereof to the facts of the lottery transaction, was conducted. A doctrinal research approach was followed within the realm of exploratory research. Results: Disposing of and acquiring residential property by way of a lottery results in a number of actual tax consequences, as well as a number of uncertainties regarding taxes (referred to as uncertain considerations). Conclusion: The conclusion is reached that the possible tax consequences of such a transaction can create tax risks or can result in unintended tax consequences relating to inter alia income tax (including capital gains tax), transfer duty and donations tax. The insights provided in this article do not always result in conclusive answers but they may, however, result in further research to be conducted, and a number of such areas for further research were identified. Should residential property lottery transactions occur more frequently in South Africa in future, it is recommended that the South African Revenue Services (SARS) issues clear guidance on the tax treatment from the perspective of the owner and the winner of such a transaction to ensure that any uncertainties are dealt with correctly.","[de Lange, Silke] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Law, Dept Mercantile Law, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [van Wyk, Danielle] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"van Wyk, D (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Sch Accountancy, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",dvanwyk@sun.ac.za,,"De Lange, Silke/0000-0003-3939-5209; van Wyk, Danielle/0000-0002-4867-6988",,,,,11,1,1,0,2,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Hence the aim of this study is to compare the out-of-sample forecasting performances of the models used throughout the study and to show that the NoVaS method is better than GARCH(1,1)-type models in the context of out-of sample forecasting performance. We study the out-of-sample forecasting performances of GARCH(1,1)-type models and NoVaS method based on generalized error distribution, unlike normal and Student's t-distribution. Also, what makes the study different is the use of the return series, calculated logarithmically and arithmetically in terms of forecasting performance. For comparing the out-of-sample forecasting performances, we focused on different datasets, such as S&P 500, logarithmic and arithmetic BST 100 return series. The key result of our analysis is that the NoVaS method performs better out-of-sample forecasting performance than GARCH(1,1)-type models. The result can offer useful guidance in model building for out-of-sample forecasting purposes, aimed at improving forecasting accuracy.","[Gulay, Emrah; Emec, Hamdi] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econometr, Izmir, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University,"Gulay, E (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Econometr, IIBF, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey.",gulay.emrah@gmail.com,"Emeç, Hamdi/P-8304-2019; Gulay, Emrah/J-2803-2019; Gulay, Emrah/GQP-7931-2022","Gulay, Emrah/0000-0001-7825-333X;",,,,,36,4,7,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Starting from a random allocation of firms across cities, firms relocate in pursuit of greater profit. There are several key results. First, there is a positive and nonlinear relationship between the strength of inter-industry external economies and coagglomeration, a result that supports using coagglomeration to study the microfoundations of agglomeration economies and to determine the boundaries of industry clusters. Second, the equilibrium level of coagglomeration is less than the efficient level. Third, history matters in the sense that a legacy of homogeneous or heterogeneous cities tilts the economy in favor of the historical pattern. Fourth, an increase in firm size increases coagglomeration. Fifth, an increase in relocation cost increases coagglomeration.","[O'Sullivan, Arthur; Strange, William C.] Lewis & Clark Coll, Econ, 0615 SW Palatine Hill Rd, Portland, OR 97219 USA; [Strange, William C.] Univ Toronto, Real Estate, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Strange, WC (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Real Estate, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",wstrange@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Centre for Real Estate at the Rotman School of Management,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Centre for Real Estate at the Rotman School of Management,"We thank Heski Bar-Isaac, Robert Helsley, Jordan Rappaport, Kristian Behrens and two helpful referees for comments on previous versions of the article.

It situates this power imbalance within the context of global economic realities, including the high profitability of extractive TNCs; rampant poverty in developing countries; dependence of many developing countries on the extractive sector for economic sustenance; and lack of regulatory expertise on the part of developing countries. The article suggests two potential avenues for addressing this power imbalance. First, it advocates for the recognition of TNCs as subjects of international law, thus paving way for the imposition of some international law duties on TNCs. Secondly, the article argues that civil society groups should be empowered to participate actively in the regulatory process and that an empowered civil society could potentially counterbalance the power of TNCs and other corporations.","[Oshionebo, Evaristus] Univ Calgary, Law, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Oshionebo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Law, Calgary, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,,55,6,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

To improve these outcomes, developing-world governments have adopted several policies aimed at raising female marriage age. This paper investigates the effects of these policies for females in developing countries where parents strongly prefer sons to daughters. I find that raising female marriage age in such countries may have the unintended consequence of increasing the prevalence of female infanticide and sex-selective abortion. Where parents strongly prefer sons to daughters, some parents seek to dispose of their unwanted daughters through child-bride marriage, female infanticide, or sex-selective abortion. By raising the cost of child-bride marriage relative to infanticide or abortion, policies that raise female marriage age induce such parents to substitute the latter disposal methods for the former. I evaluate one such policy in Haryana, India and find empirical support for this prediction. My analysis suggests that from the perspective of female welfare, child-bride marriage may be a second-best institution, or constrained optimum, in developing countries that exhibit strong son preference.","[Suarez, Paola A.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr MS 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Suarez, Paola A.] NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA",George Mason University; New York University,"Suarez, PA (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr MS 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.;Suarez, PA (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St,6th Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",PSuarez@GMU.edu,,,Mercatus Center at George Mason University; Classical Liberal Institute at New York University School of Law,Mercatus Center at George Mason University; Classical Liberal Institute at New York University School of Law,"I thank Peter Leeson, Chris Coyne, the Editors, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

The research has discovered that most of the respondents were possessed and endorsed sufficient items to consider them as a capable and an eligible officer for the task of PO. Nevertheless, the finding also uncovered that the respondent may experience some problems in sustaining their perseverance to accomplish their tasks and maintain their confidence level in making the vital decision. There were also issues on the relationship between stakeholders and officers, and the paucity of PO involvement in the development of the organisation ICT master plan. Therefore, it can be deduced that the features offered by the Rasch Wright map were very helpful in determining the level of public servant competency for the appointment of PO in the public sector to enhance the ICT procurement procedure.","[Ahmad, Azran; Arshad, Noor Habibah; Syed Aris, Syaripah Ruzaini] Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Ahmad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA UiTM, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",azran77@gmail.com; habibah@tmsk.uitm.edu.my; ruzaini@tmsk.uitm.edu.my,"AHMAD, AZRAN/AAX-7239-2021","Ahmad, Azran/0000-0002-8868-3437",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3969,3975,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800110,0

The research shows that the financial fraud behavior of listed companies is not only driven by their own interests, but also affected by multiple factors such as the punishment of regulatory authorities, the success rate of supervision, and the willingness of the accounting firm to cooperate.

The aim of the research presented in this paper is to map the present situation with regards to language education in companies in the Czech Republic. To achieve the aim, a large empirical questionnaire survey was conducted among 179 micro-, 141 small, 164 medium-sized and 123 large companies in the Czech Republic. The survey was constructed around the formulated research questions. The results of the survey revealed that relatively high priority is placed on language education in companies in the Czech Republic, in particular in large and medium-sized companies. Large and medium-sized companies perceive foreign language education as an integral part of corporate education. These companies use foreign languages very often and require good knowledge of foreign languages from their employees. However, the fact that, on the one hand, companies require very good knowledge of foreign languages and support language education to a significant extent, and, on the other hand, they feel the need to improve the language knowledge of their employees, implies that a systematic approach is not applied. A systematic approach to language education in companies can therefore help companies to improve their present situation and the effectiveness of language education as well.","[Caha, Zdenek] Inst Technol & Business, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Caha, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Dept Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",caha@mail.vstecb.cz,"Caha, Zdeněk/AAS-5290-2020; Caha, Zdeněk/AAN-2017-2020","Caha, Zdeněk/0000-0003-2363-034X;",,,,,26,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,8043,8052,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553209003,0

Based on an in-depth longitudinal study of a critical case, this article sheds light on these issues by analysing the case of techno-emotional cuisine', a global gastronomic movement initiated and led by chef Ferran Adria and his team at the restaurant elBulli in Catalonia (in Northern Spain). The results suggest that the dynamics of formation of a new epistemic movement depend on the form and nature of the interactions between the local buzz and global pipelines, and on the capacity of the originating community to develop and diffuse the new rules and episteme' on a global scale while consolidating them locally.","[Capdevila, Ignasi] PSB Paris Sch Business, Paris, France; [Cohendet, Patrick; Simon, Laurent] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Capdevila, I (通讯作者)，PSB Paris Sch Business, Paris, France.",i.capdevila@psbedu.paris,"SIMON, Laurent/AAW-7587-2020; Capdevila, Ignasi/D-4048-2015","Capdevila, Ignasi/0000-0003-2714-8059",,,,,97,13,13,4,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The choice of the four countries (Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal) relies on the fact that they are dealing with the highest unemployment rates in the European Union and a certain typology of the economic structure. The originality of our research is offered by its direction, less tackled until now, namely the focus on the particularities of the economic sectors, trying to capture differences between them. The importance and the impact of the results are supported by the methods used to produce them, indicators and econometric models that are on trend and bring extra information to available studies. Descriptive statistics and mismatch indexes are used to outline the economic and labour market structure, while the econometric models built on panel data capture the impact of factors such as GVA growth, specialization and labour market mismatches on the unemployment rate at six economic sectors level. Our paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we have demonstrated that agriculture is the sector of activity less sensitive to output fluctuations in terms of unemployment and can become a buffer for the jobless in times of recessions. Second, we have proved that industry, as a whole, is highly responsive to economic developments and bad specialization could worsen unemployment situation in this sector. Third, we showed that educational mismatches have a significant impact on unemployment in those sectors of activity that employ low educated workforce.","[Dimian, Gina Cristina; Ileanu, Bogdan Vasile] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ Cybernet Stat & Informat, Dept Stat & Econometr, 15-17 Calea Dorobanti,Dist 1, Bucharest 010552, Romania; [Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela; Serban, Andreea Claudia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, 6 Romana Sq,Dist 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Serban, AC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, 6 Romana Sq,Dist 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",andre_serban@yahoo.com,"Ileanu, Bogdan/HDM-5675-2022; Serban, Andreea Claudia/M-8642-2015; Ileanu, Bogdan Vasile/V-1290-2019; Gina Cristina, Dimian/HOF-2342-2023; Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/GYU-2760-2022","Serban, Andreea Claudia/0000-0001-9361-2345; Ileanu, Bogdan Vasile/0000-0002-9229-3431; Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/0000-0002-7884-8445",,,,,71,5,6,0,18,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The Government of the Slovak Republic strives to create a favorable business environment with a special emphasis on family business. In general, family businesses are hard to define, but they have certain features, a long-term perspective for members of a family not included in the business, the business name of the company is selected by the name of the founder. One of the most important changes in current business environment is globalization, internalization of the business and work environment. In Slovakia arise small and medium companies, arise the opportunity for development of family businesses. Consequence of globalization is formation of a multicultural work environment, opportunities for Slovak managers to verify their competences outside their native land. The aim of this article is to highlight the changes in the business environment in Slovakia, to highlight the changes in the requirements on the managerial competences. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Slovak's economy, they represent 99% of all business in the Slovak republic.

Drawing on theoretical assumptions about the impact of corruption on the quality of the business environment, we explore possible determinants of perceived corruption. We argue that explaining the determinants of corruption perceptions could be a valuable input for creating effective anti-corruption policies. In the paper, we perform a detailed analysis on the case of Serbia, a transition country with relatively widespread corruption in the business environment. Using the non-parametric analysis of variance test, we examine the significance of differences in the perceived spread of corruption across a number of independent variables (regions, size of locality, industry, size, and years of operation). Specifying an ordered logistic regression model, we estimate the relation between corruption perceptions and a number of potential causes: frequencies of unofficial payments or gifts for different purposes, the impact that unofficial payments to public officials have on the business operations of the respondents, as well as attitudes of the respondents about the quality of the judicial system and political stability. We find that perceptions of corruption as an obstacle to business operations can be linked to the frequency of unofficial payments to deal with customs and taxes, as well as the impact of unofficial payments to local or regional government officials on business performance of the respondents. The results provide useful insights into what policy measures are necessary to reduce the level of corruption, as well as how the effects of such measures can be assessed.","[Dzunic, Marija; Golubovic, Natasa] Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia",University of Nis,"Dzunic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Fac Econ, Nish, Serbia.",marija_dzunic@ni.ac.rs; natasa.golubovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,"Dzunic, Marija/HME-2028-2023; Golubović, Nataša L/HJA-7912-2022","Dzunic, Marija/0000-0001-5269-1921;","Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development","Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development","The authors are grateful to the Republic of Serbia Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development for the funds and support that made this research possible.",,67,4,4,3,29,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

J,"England, C",,,,"England, Christopher",,,Land Value Taxation in Vancouver: Rent-Seeking and the Tax Revolt,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROPERTY-TAX,"At the beginning of the 20(th) century, Vancouver obtained international acclaim as a single-tax city. Supporters claimed that land value taxation was responsible for the spectacular growth of the city. Even critics believed that it had produced a building boom and declining rents. Yet, over several decades, the system was scaled back and ultimately ended in 1984. This article argues that the property tax revolt can be understood with Mancur Olson's model of collective action. Property owners are better organized than other parties impacted by housing policy because they have financial resources and a salient economic concern in housing. Thus, the special interests of property owners in higher values and unrestricted use prevailed over the interests of tenants and prospective buyers. While the property tax revolt was often articulated in the progressive language of ability to pay, when confronted with progressive counterarguments, it collapsed into explicit arguments for rent-seeking.","[England, Christopher] Lincoln Inst Land Policy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [England, Christopher] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [England, Christopher] Wisconsin Hist Soc, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"England, C (通讯作者)，Lincoln Inst Land Policy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;England, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;England, C (通讯作者)，Wisconsin Hist Soc, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",Christopher.England@Wisconsinhistory.org,,,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,The research for this article was generously supported by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.

This research work addresses the issue of public awareness and acceptance for DR programs. The study focused on a methodology supported on survey of an academic sample of students from one university in Portugal. From the collected information a statistical model based on linear regression was proposed. This study suggests that female students are more willing than male students to defer their electricity consumption. Other factors such as knowledge on time of usage (TOU) tariffs, concerns about reduction of imported energy and the acceptance of the automatic control of the heating or cooling system could have a positive effect on the willingness to defer electricity use. The conclusion of this paper presents then important insights for encouraging the students to engage in DR programs.

Social innovation has emerged as a promising approach to tackle the challenge of urban liveability. Nevertheless, our understanding of the processes through which social innovations are developed and managed in critical sectors for large cities is still somewhat limited. This paper has analysed 19 case studies pertaining to third sector organisations operating in large Italian cities to find out how they produce social innovations and enhance urban liveability. The empirical results have revealed that these initiatives address some of previously neglected needs of citizens through flexible mode of service provision and gradual implementation of a bundle of services. In many cases, they include a diverse base of users and involve volunteers.

Examining the Perception of Takaful Operators in Malaysia,VISION 2020: SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,,,English,Proceedings Paper,32nd Conference of the International-Business-Information-Management-Association (IBIMA),"NOV 15-16, 2018","Seville, SPAIN",Int Business Informat Management Assoc,,Takaful; Innovation; Takaful Operators and Malaysia,,"Takaful is a social and ethical insurance based on the principle of Ta'awun (cooperation) and Tabarru (donation) where the risk is shared collectively by members of a policy. The concept of Takaful is providing financial assistance to the participants on a basis for mutual assistance, brotherhood and solidarity in cases where the participants face some misfortune. Takaful is an alternative to the conventional insurance, and its primary objective is to protect the participants based on the ethical and moral foundations. Due to its unique characteristics, Takaful is one of the fastest growing areas of International finance. An industry that started with less than 10 players in the early eighties has become a multi-billion-dollar global industry that currently spans across South-East Asia, Middle East, Africa, Central Asia and Europe with more than 200 players. The purpose of this research is to understand how Takaful operators view Takaful products that are being created with innovative methods and techniques in Malaysia. As compare to most of the prior research that are centred on the demand side (i.e. consumers), this research however focuses on the supply side of Takaful industry (i.e. the Takaful operators). The findings of this research are significant as it pushes the industry to be innovative in their products and services. Not only innovative products are good to the customer, but also enhance the Malaysian Takaful products to become global models. To achieve this objective, in-depth and semistructured interviews were conducted with the relevant fourteen officers among the Takaful Operators (TOs) to obtain their views regarding the objective. From the findings, it can be seen that there is a negative trend of innovation in the Takaful industry as the respondents highlighted a lot of issues and challenges that hamper innovation in the whole industry. Only a few respondents thought that the industry is already innovative and not facing any major issues at the moment. They also suggested various possible solutions to the current situation which indirectly shows that there are many aspects that can be improved in the Takaful industry to achieve innovation that meets consumer requirements and satisfaction.","[Hassan, Rusni; Kassim, Salina] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance IIiBF, Gombak, Malaysia; [Salman, Syed Ahmed] Lincoln Univ Coll, Fac Business & Accountancy, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia; [Majdi, Hafiz] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kulliyyah Econ & Management Sci, Gombak, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia; Lincoln University College; International Islamic University Malaysia,"Hassan, R (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Inst Islamic Banking & Finance IIiBF, Gombak, Malaysia.",hrusni@gmail.com; salmaniium@gmail.com; ksalina@iium.edu.my; hafizmajdi@gmail.com,"Kassim, Salina/Q-7008-2019; Syed, Ahmed Salman/T-6309-2018","Kassim, Salina/0000-0002-7514-8750; salman, ahmed/0000-0002-5634-2726; Syed, Ahmed Salman/0000-0001-7101-5961",,,,,20,1,1,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,7007,7010,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207098,0

Although unemployment is currently at the level of the natural unemployment rate in the Slovak labour market, the reality is that there is a mismatch between supply and demand that relates to several factors. While on the one hand, graduates of secondary schools and universities do not find jobs in their professions on the labour market, on the other hand, employers cannot get skilled labour for certain jobs and are also dissatisfied with school graduates because many of them did not have any work experience before entering the job. Since 2015, secondary education has introduced the possibility of dual learning, which combines theoretical teaching with practice in the enterprise. This system is also used by some, mainly technically-oriented, universities. However, the dual education system is set for the whole country, regardless of the specifics in regions. Therefore, one of the less developed regions - the Presov self-governing region, was chosen to be an example of how to improve the system of vocational education and training.

Partial least square analysis is performed on the survey of 122 logistics firms. The results verify that knowledge resource has a positive impact on cost advantages and mediate the technology resource-cost advantages relationship. The finding presents that technologies are valuable resources for competitive advantage but easy to be purchased and substituted; hence they serve as a temporary competitive advantage. Instead, knowledge resource is the catalyst of cost advantages and provokes the technology resource to give a greater impact on cost advantages. This study reveals that knowledge resource is too costly and difficult to be imitated, hence becomes the ultimate sources of sustained competitive advantage. Launching information logistics technology is sensitive and expensive; hence, logistics firms need to exploit more on knowledge resources, consolidate them with the relevant technology resources in order to obtain operational efficiency and effectiveness. This paper unveils the theoretical and empirical evidence for insightful understanding concerning the technology-knowledge resource-performance outcome relationship.","[Karia, Noorliza] Univ Sains Malaysia, Operat Dept, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Karia, N (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Operat Dept, Usm Penang 11800, Malaysia.",noorliza@usm.my,"Karia, Noorliza/AAT-5811-2020; Karia, Noorliza/E-3948-2012","Karia, Noorliza/0000-0002-1449-9979; Karia, Noorliza/0000-0002-1449-9979",,,,,82,6,6,4,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The aim of the paper is to study the ichthyofauna of the natural aquatic ecosystems and to forward a comparative analysis from the point of view of the role that each river plays in the ecosystem. The status of the environmental factors and stability are determined by structural-functional status indices that directly or indirectly influence the ichthyofaunistic diversity. In most ichthyocenoses of the natural aquatic ecosystems in the Republic of Moldova, the species with vital cycle are dominant, along with a massive degradation of the population with a long life cycle. In all natural aquatic ecosystems, the richest diversity of ichthyofaunistic and fishery production is found in the lower courses of the Dniester River and the Prut River due to the ecotone zone. As for the diversity of the fish population (sabre carp, ide, streber, common nase, Romanian barbel, burbot), the Prut river significantly exceeds the Dniester river, which denotes a less pronounced anthropogenic phenomenon of the Prut river compared the Dniester River. An essential factor in maintaining a multidisciplinary fishery production is the systematic water quality monitoring meant to exclude excessive mineralization or pollution, a biological improvement, and a populating with spawns that would change today's unfavourable situation.","[Munteanu (Pila), Mihaela; Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Munteanu, M (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",mihaela_pila@yahoo.com; sstanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017; Pila, Mihaela M/AAM-1481-2020","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968;",,,,,8,4,4,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,4913,4918,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553205099,0

We used a panel Granger-causality analysis based on annual data for eight transition countries, covering the period 1995-2011. The main finding is that the causality relations analysed are heterogeneous processes and are identified more often when we measure structural changes by value added than by changes in employment. Among the countries analysed, we separate a subgroup of economies with very strong bilateral causality (small countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia), a subgroup in which no causal relationships are observed (e.g., Hungary in the case of employment), and a group with a one-directional relationship (e.g., Poland, where GDP changes cause employment changes, but not vice versa). The research results point to the necessity of taking into account different relationships, whether one- or two-directional, between growth and structural changes in government economic policy.

RES should contribute to a consistent supply of energy and accessible to all, security of supply and an environmentally friendly system. However, a successful inclusion of RES in the current infrastructure is a complex process due to several barriers which requires the creation of a resilient plan. This plan should provide a satisfactory trajectory to the objectives stipulated while considering the risks involved. This paper explores how the integration of renewable energies impacts on the resilience of the Portuguese electricity system through the evaluation of scenarios for 2030. The influence of the risks in the scenarios was addressed by combining deterministic results obtained with Energy-PLAN and Monte Carlo simulation with the @Risk software. The results show that the electric system is vulnerable to the variability of the RES power in the future which may result on excess of electricity production or load curtailment, depending on the availability of the resources. The importance of the interconnection is highlighted for an effective management of the electricity system. Nonetheless, this RES strategy brings clear benefits in the environmental sphere, reducing CO2 emissions even in pessimistic scenarios.","[Oliveira, Arlindo] Univ Minho, Dept Porduct & Syst, Guimaraes, Portugal; [Ferreira, Paula] Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Res Ctr, Guimardes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Ferreira, P (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, ALGORITMI Res Ctr, Guimardes, Portugal.",paulaf@dps.uminho.pt,"Ferreira, Paula/H-8646-2012","Ferreira, Paula/0000-0002-3712-4803",,,,,18,12,13,0,0,UNIV MINHO,GUIMARAES,"CAMPUS AZUREM, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",2183-3974,,978-989-97050-8-1,ICOPEV INT C PROJ EC,,,2018,,,,,,,1,6,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN0TO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000473533800001,0

Firstly, we found the most pronounced correlation between the number of innovative products, works and services in the total amount of shipped goods, performed activities and technological innovation costs per one person. This demonstrates the need for planning and implementing state programs on raising intellectual capital in multicultural regions with traditional economics. Secondly, we have identified clear interdependence between the number of smaller enterprises per 1000 people and the share of Russian people in ethnically aboriginal regions. Therefore, the influence of the Russian nationality ensures formation of entrepreneurial culture in aboriginal regions and continuous development of intellectual capital. Thirdly, there is a correlation between life expectancy and population density in aboriginal regions. This demonstrates low level of life in the regions with low population density and strong influence of traditional economy. Creation of hi - tech companies and larger amounts of goods fabrication requires creation of local unions, developing the share of scientists and entrepreneurs and formation of government programs: these are the most important success factors. To achieve that we must create a cooperation program covering all parties participating in intellectual capital development in the region. State regulation of intellectual capital development must take into consideration peculiar features of social and cultural development of aboriginal region strongly influenced by traditional economy. This direction of regional development will be available only in case of equal dialogue between business and authorities. Suggested options for using traditional knowledge for developing intellectual capital can improve economic position of the region, create new workplaces and, therefore, improve the level of life of population in the regions strongly influenced by traditional economy.","[Popov, Evgeny] Ural Fed Univ, Inst Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Vlasov, Maxim] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Ural Federal University; Ural Federal University,"Popov, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Inst Econ, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",epopov@mail.ru; mvlassov@mail.ru,"Vlasov, Maxim/K-5206-2017","Vlasov, Maxim/0000-0002-3763-327X",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,2483,2490,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553203053,0

The importance of national agriculture is given by the agricultural tradition of Romania, the soil and a temperate continental climate favourable to agricultural crops, the three elements competing to obtain agricultural productions that potentially cover the food consumption of the population. The agricultural production, unlike the industrial one, has a high degree of risk depending largely on the climatic conditions. In the Baragan Plain, the continental climate determines large fluctuations of precipitations, which directly determine the increase or decrease of soil water reserves. In order to cope with current demands and to increase food production, the main concern of plant growers has always been to ensure water availability. Knowing the factors that influence the efficiency of water used in agricultures and hoping to increase this efficiency have continuously been the objective of many modern studies. The difference between the supply of irrigation and the demand is increasing every year as a result of the increase in the rate of the population growth and of the migration from one place to another. The present paper proposes an analysis of the need for irrigation in the North Baragan Plain, as well as an analysis of rainfall, of the irrigation facilities and of the irrigated surfaces.

Emerging changes and the uncertainty of tomorrow require companies to plan actions in distant future which, at the same time, carry significant risk of failure. It can be assumed that the more surprising, innovative product or service for end-users - the higher the likelihood of a company's success. Competing for ideas, and surprised by disruptive innovations and changes in consumer preferences resulting from cannibalization of products, processes and services - entrepreneurs perform activities which aim to implement the imperative of ambidexterity. This category, based on the ability to manage conflicting activities, has been extensively discussed in the subject literature 3 . The main contexts in which it is analysed are the issues of exploitation and exploration, and more specifically the ability of companies to skilfully balance between these two categories'. Exploitation concerns productivity, efficiency, improvement and implementation, while exploration refers to change, experiment, flexibility and innovation s . Thus, a number of activities are simultaneously responsible for achieving the ambidexterity of the organization. Creativity centres are entities which usually operate in the area of non-profit activities, and include both businesses and the public sector. Their overall goal is broadly understood innovative activity for the business. By operating as crowdsourcing, they are places which support the commercialization of young entrepreneurs and local communities, and provide a platform for corporate social responsibility. Centres of creativity, in specific functional areas, are places of exchange of knowledge and experience - leading to innovations, and at the same time being the source of the ambiguity of business organizations. The goal of the article is to indicate the possibility of shaping the ambidexterity of the organization (mainly in the explore context(6)) based on the opportunities generated by centres of creativity. The goal was met using the analysis of the performance of scientific centres in Europe, as well as literature in the field of innovation, innovativeness and ambidexterity in both profit and non-profit organizations.","[Sus, Aleksandra] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Strategy & Management Methods, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Sus, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Dept Strategy & Management Methods, Wroclaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6450,6460,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207043,0

First, we derive four firm-specific cluster competences from existing literature as key components of a T-shaped model which is based on the resource and the relational view on knowledge spillovers. Second, we evaluate the explanatory power of our model in terms of firm success by conducting empirical testing on the basis of several logistic regressions in the form of proportional odds models. For this purpose, we use a hitherto unexploited firm-level data set, gained from a survey conducted among small and medium-sized craft businesses in Germany. The results provide evidence that idiosyncratic cluster competences on the firm level are supportive of firm success in business clusters.","[Tomenendal, Matthias; Kirch, Johannes] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany; [Raffer, Christian] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Stockklauser, Stephanie] Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Bremen,"Tomenendal, M (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany.",matthias.tomenendal@hwr-berlin.de,,,Institute for Applied Research (IFAF) Berlin,Institute for Applied Research (IFAF) Berlin,This work was supported by the Institute for Applied Research (IFAF) Berlin.,,85,2,2,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

A review of literature revealed a gap formed by the lack of either an established approach or a normative model of how to develop portfolios in SMEs. To bridge this gap, this paper is based on topical information and offers a method that supports decision makers in their choice of the most suitable project portfolio. This method can be implemented by the use of a simulation software tool for project portfolio optimization while considering constraints and conformity with corporate strategy. The authors conclude that the foundation of success is to formulate optimum portfolios, the configurations of which reflect all key strategic parameters. Moreover, it must be feasible to implement such a portfolio in the environment of SMEs within disposable firm resources and consider identifiable risks upon the selection of the effective project portfolio. One chosen case study evidenced the viability of this approach. The approach to project portfolio optimization discussed in this paper shows the effectiveness of the selected methodology for project portfolio optimization that in turn significantly contributes to meeting strategic goals and thus an increase in company performance and shareholders' value. The use of a common software tool together with the right access to data collection and processing allows managers to make better decisions for the effective future allocation of resources over the chosen project portfolio.","[Vacik, Emil; Kracik, Lukas] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Spacek, Miroslav; Fotr, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Entrepreneurship, Prague, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vacík, E (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Plzen, Czech Republic.",vacik@kfu.zcu.cz; miroslav.spacek@vse.cz; fotr@vse.cz; lukas.kracik@gmail.com,"Špaček, Miroslav/K-6516-2015; Vacik, Emil/O-5277-2015","Špaček, Miroslav/0000-0001-6042-3249; Vacik, Emil/0000-0002-8729-4894","Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics in Prague [IGA2 IP 304015]","Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics in Prague","This paper was published with the support of the IGA2 IP 304015 internal grant agency program at the Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics in Prague.",,58,8,10,2,31,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The determinants of BDA adoption potential within Malaysian warehousing industry was explored using this conceptual paper. The theoretical gap was identified in this study by exploring the factors of BDA adoption potentials. Findings suggest five determinants that might have essential effects on the BDA adoption potentials within warehousing industry. This study will serve as a facilitator for warehousing firms to implement the most attractive and appropriate strategies in adopting BDA thus boost Malaysian sustainable supply chain and logistics system. This research paper enables warehousing industry to understand clearly the possible determinants that need to be considered for BDA adoption in warehouse operations. Previous studies explored the adoption of BDA in emerging economies as well as at the organizational level by using TOE framework. However, TOE framework has not been integrated in examining the BDA adoption intentions in warehousing industry.

SMEs continuously face many operational risks and uncertainties in their daily operations, and these risks threaten to reduce productivity, increase costs and reduce profits. Aim: The purpose of this article was to develop an operational risk management framework that SMEs can use to identify and analyse risks in their operations and take corrective actions to mitigate these risks. Setting: Small and medium-sized enterprises in South Africa do not view risk management as a key component of organisational success, despite evidence that businesses that adopt risk management strategies are more likely to survive and grow. Methods: The article is exploratory in nature, and a conceptual analysis approach was used to formulate the framework. This study reviewed relevant literature sources on risk published between 2002 and 2017. Results: The four process steps of risk management were used as a reference point and form the foundation for the operational risk management framework. The categories of operational; marketing; technical and financial risks were identified from a review of available literature on risk management. Conclusion: There is a dearth of research that deals with operational risk management frameworks for SMEs. The expected contribution of this article, therefore, is twofold: firstly, it is envisaged that managers or owners of SMEs could use the proposed framework as a tool to appraise and minimise their operational risks; secondly, it will add to the current body of knowledge on risk appraisal for SMEs.","[Naude, Micheline J.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Management Informat Syst & Publ Adm, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Naude, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Management Informat Syst & Publ Adm, Durban, South Africa.",naudem@ukzn.ac.za,"CHIWESHE, NIGEL TAWANDA FARAYI/ABD-2150-2021; Naude, Micheline Juliana/O-6272-2019","CHIWESHE, NIGEL TAWANDA FARAYI/0000-0001-7757-211X; Naude, Micheline Juliana/0000-0002-0475-9474",,,,,58,15,17,2,24,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Policymakers are concerned with effective ways of encouraging better nutrition and more physical exercise to combat increasing levels of obesity and overweight residents. Commuting to work can be an important means for regular physical activity. Based on an ecological approach, this paper examines the effects of means of transportation to work on the prevalence of overweight and obesity at the U.S. state level. This analysis extends the previous literature by including a series of transportation variables in a regression model examining state prevalence of overweight and obesity using the most recent panel data from 2004 to 2013. We find that increased automobile usage contributes to the rising trend in the prevalence of obesity and overweight among states. In contrast, active transportation to work (public transportation and walking) has a negative impact on state prevalence of obesity and overweight. The paper concludes with policy suggestions,for combating obesity and overweight by integrating public health objectives into the transportation planning and investment process.","[Chen, Can] Florida Int Univ, Steven J Green Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Publ Adm, Modesto A Maidique PCA-354B,11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Menifield, Charles E.] Rutgers Univ Newark, SPAA, 195 Univ Ave, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark,"Chen, C (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Steven J Green Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Publ Adm, Modesto A Maidique PCA-354B,11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",cchen@fiu.edu; menifieldc@missouri.edu,,,,,,,33,6,8,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

When managers have better knowledge about the effectiveness of donations and their altruistic preferences, it is difficult for shareholders to tell whether charitable donations are made for a strategic purpose or due to managerial altruism. We characterize the equilibrium donations in a heterogeneous competition model. We show that managerial altruism is a substitute for the effectiveness of donations, and excess donations cannot be prevented by a compensation scheme that reduces the interest conflicts between ownership and management. Under board authorization, the board will tolerate donations with high effectiveness and low altruism as well as donations corresponding to low effectiveness and high altruism. Under a penalty scheme, the altruistic manager will increase donations, in order to increase donation's strategic benefit to compensate for the loss from the penalty.

We find that communication in the form of non-binding broadcast chat messages increases wages, effort levels, and overall efficiency regardless of the information regime. It serves as a negotiation platform and helps workers and firms learn how to cooperate. Communication outperforms information transparency in motivating trust and cooperative behavior in one-shot interactions. Although transparency might be important in the long term, it does not improve any of the market outcomes in short-term relations unless it is combined with communication.

These scoring rules use only the reported forecasts for assessment, neglecting related variables such as the specific questions that a person chose to forecast. In this paper, we study whether information related to question selection influences our estimates of forecaster ability. In other words, do good and bad forecasters tend to select questions in different ways? If so, can we capitalize on these selections when estimating forecaster ability? We address these questions by extending a recently-developed psychometric model of forecasts to include question selection data. We compare the extended psychometric model to a simpler model, studying its unidimensionality assumption and highlighting the unique information that it can provide. We find that the model can make use of the fact that good forecasters tend to select more questions than bad forecasters, and we conclude that question selection data can be beneficial above and beyond reported forecasts. As a side benefit, the resulting model can potentially provide unique incentives for forecaster participation. (C) 2017 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

I reconcile these perspectives by distinguishing between two forms of unemployment. The first form is structural unemployment, while the second form is cyclical unemployment, a less permanent component of unemployment that is linked to the economic cycle. I apply a cohort-based model to study both effects over the life cycle using panel data methods applied to a sample of developed countries. My results show that higher levels of structural unemployment decrease fertility, but that the effects of cyclical variations in unemployment depend to a large extent on the age at which they are experienced. Cyclical reductions in the unemployment level mostly result in increases in fertility rates. However, for some age groups, positive variations in the cyclical component of unemployment can also have a positive impact on fertility.","[Pifarre i Arolas, Hector] Max Planck Inst Demograf Forsch, Rostock, Germany; [Pifarre i Arolas, Hector] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Hlth & Econ, Barcelona, Spain",Max Planck Society; Pompeu Fabra University,"Arolas, HPI (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Demograf Forsch, Rostock, Germany.;Arolas, HPI (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Hlth & Econ, Barcelona, Spain.",pifarreiarolas@demogr.mpg.de,,", Hector/0000-0002-6056-3636",Max Planck Society,Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society),"Open access funding provided by the Max Planck Society.

Although road is the mode that best meets current transport demand requirements, it has also benefited from market failures. These market failures, including negative externalities, have led the European Union and its Member States to implement the common transport policy, the aim of which is to tackle these externalities and include their cost in the final price of transport. One of the measures undertaken in order to reflect the real costs of freight transport has been road pricing. However, this measure does not affect all Member States equally. This article focuses on the effects of road pricing for peripheral countries. Such countries feel the negative effects more strongly due to their geographical location and the fact that their modal pattern is even more unbalanced than that of Central European countries. Therefore, this paper takes a novel and practical approach by evaluating the impact of road pricing on the euros per ton cost of Spanish shipments to three European destinations. This study seeks to quantify the additional cost incurred on exports of a peripheral country (Spain) as a result of road pricing. This additional cost can logically affect the export capability of a country and its external competitiveness, especially in cases such as Spain, where its competitiveness is largely based on the price of its exports. One way to avoid the effects of road pricing is to use alternative modes, however, these modes are not always well-suited to the demand. That is why an analysis of the current state of the two main alternative modes, rail and sea, has also been carried out to determine their capability to capture traffic diverted from road. The results show a moderate impact on costs but this can, however, affect the country's competitiveness. The paper also highlights the need to work on developing alternative modes, especially rail, given the difficulties they face in competing with road and meeting demand requirements.","[Vazquez Paja, Barbara; Martinez Moya, Julian] Univ Valencia, Inst Int Econ, Valencia, Spain; [Martinez Moya, Julian] ValenciaPort Fdn, Valencia, Spain; [Feo Valero, Maria] Univ Valencia, Inst Int Econ, Dept Econ Struct, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Paja, BV (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Inst Int Econ, Valencia, Spain.",vazpabar@uv.es,,"Martinez Moya, Julian/0000-0001-6932-807X",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under its National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society [ECO2014-58674_R]; University Jaume I of Castellon [13I298],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under its National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society; University Jaume I of Castellon,This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under its National Programme for Research Aimed at the Challenges of Society [grant number ECO2014-58674_R] and by the University Jaume I of Castellon under Grant 13I298 of the Research Promotion Plan 2013.,,41,3,3,2,11,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Expectation of productivity convergence in the pulp and paper industries of Canadian provinces and of the states of its southern neighbour is high since they are trading partners with fairly high level of exchanges in both pulp and paper products. Moreover, they share a common production technology that changed very little over the last century. We supplement the North-American regional data with national data for two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden, which provides a scope to compare the productivity performances of four leading players in global pulp and paper industry. We find evidence in favour of the catch-up hypothesis among the regional pulp and paper industries of U.S. and Canada in our sample. The growth performance is at the advantage of Canadian provinces relative to their U.S. counterparts. The two Nordic countries, that had the lowest productivity levels in 1971, erased most of the gap and in some cases moved ahead of their North-American counterparts.

We use novel panel data that link survey and administrative data for a sample of disadvantaged adults who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Our estimation approach pays particular attention to the potential pathways linking childhood homelessness to adult employment. We find that those experiencing homelessness for the first time as children are less likely to be employed. For women, this relationship is largely explained by the lower educational attainment and higher welfare receipt (both in general and in the form of mental illness-related disability payments) of those experiencing childhood homelessness. Higher rates of high school incompletion and incarceration explain some of the link between childhood homelessness and men's employment; however, childhood homelessness continues to have a substantial direct effect on male employment rates.","[Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.; Zhu, Anna] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.; Zhu, Anna] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Zhu, Anna] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Queensland; University of Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Zhu, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Zhu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Zhu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",deborah.cobb-clark@sydney.edu.au; anna.zhu@unimelb.edu.au,"Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013; Zhu, Anna/N-7447-2015","Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886; Zhu, Anna/0000-0002-1671-5428",Australian Research Council [DP140102614],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This study was funded by Australian Research Council Discovery Grant (DP140102614).,,83,16,25,2,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Results suggest that corporate benefits are not balanced by welfare gains to the children and this creates a tension between positive perceptions of the initiative and negative concerns with its targeting of children. This raises a number of ethical issues related to corporate marketing in schools and provides empirical support for earlier theoretical work in this area. The paper contributes to CSR literature by suggesting that opinions towards corporate giving are determined both by perceptions of their underlying motives and in relation to the benefits they provide to stakeholders. Finally, we provide support for the need for policy and regulatory revision with regard to children's vulnerability to in-school marketing.","[Aitken, Robert; Watkins, Leah] Univ Otago, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Aitken, R (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand.",Rob.aitken@otago.ac.nz; Leah.watkins@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,44,8,10,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

When asked to answer questions that measure knowledge of basic financial concepts, women are less likely than men to answer correctly and more likely to indicate that they do not know the answer. Both young and old women show low levels of financial literacy. Moreover, women for whom financial knowledge is likely to be very importantfor example widows or single womenalso know little about concepts relevant for day-to-day financial decisions. The gender differences are present for very basic as well as more advanced measures of financial literacy. This is important because financial literacy has been linked to economic behavior, including retirement planning and wealth accumulation. Women live longer than men and are likely to spend time in widowhood. Thus, improving women's financial literacy is key to helping them prepare for retirement and promoting their financial security.","[Bucher-Koenen, Tabea] Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Munich, Germany; [Lusardi, Annamaria] George Washington Univ, Econ & Accountancy, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Alessie, Rob] Univ Groningen, Microeconometr, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Rooij, Maarten] Nederlandsche Bank, Econ & Res Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Max Planck Society; George Washington University; University of Groningen; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Bucher-Koenen, T (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Social Law & Social Policy, Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Munich, Germany.",bucher-koenen@mea.mpisoc.mpg.de; alusardi@gwu.edu; R.J.M.Alessie@rug.nl; M.C.J.van.Rooij@dnb.nl,"Lusardi, Annamaria/AEB-6291-2022","Alessie, Rob/0000-0002-5128-6753",Netspar; European Investment Bank Institute through EIBURS initiative,Netspar; European Investment Bank Institute through EIBURS initiative,"Financial support from Netspar is gratefully acknowledged.

The success of a RUC in providing for the long term stability of highway finance depends partly on how drivers respond to changes in the tax structure and also other determinants of driving behavior. Region specific characteristics, such as public transit accessibility and biking infrastructure, may also affect vehicle miles traveled (VMT) demand. This paper uses econometric techniques to examine the determinants of VMT using data from the Oregon Household Activities Survey (OHAS). We use standard OLS regression to examine the impact of urban density, household income, fuel cost, transit mileage, household location, and additional household characteristics on VMT. Preliminary results show that statewide Oregon demand for VMT is positively and significantly impacted by household income. Statewide, fuel price, transit use and population density are all found to be statistically significant and negatively related to household VMT. However, at the regional level some of these variables lose significance. Holding all factors constant, household VMT is found to differ by region as well as by population density.

A Practical Review of the Study's Methodology, Results, and Policy Recommendations",JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PATENT; ENTITIES,"On October 6, 2016, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released its survey of patent assertion entities (PAEs) and certain licensing and manufacturing firms. The study, conducted under authority of Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, aimed to move past the limited information that can be gleaned from litigation records-an important goal given that over 90 percent of patent enforcement activity occurs outside the courtroom. By compiling and publishing nonpublic data on licensing agreements and patent acquisition practices from 2009 through 2013, the study provides new insight into how certain PAEs operate. The empirical approach the FTC took, however, does impose constraints on the study's reported results. And importantly, the report presents case studies that cannot be generalized, calling into question the policy recommendations that would apply to all patent infringement suits. This article summarizes the key findings reported by the FTC and explains how the study's methodology limits its conclusions and is disconnected from its policy recommendations. The study provides interesting case studies of certain PAE practices, particularly in terms of litigation. In regards to licensing practices, the study's design restricts its ability to provide definitive information, but does offer some intriguing hints at different types of PAEs and should inspire additional empirical research. The study results, however, do not provide empirical support for the stated policy proposals, and moreover the proposals would impact more than PAEs.","[Layne-Farrar, Anne] Charles River Associates Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Layne-Farrar, Anne] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Charles River Associates; Northwestern University,"Layne-Farrar, A (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, Boston, MA USA.;Layne-Farrar, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",alayne-farrar@crai.com,,,Qualcomm,Qualcomm,"Vice President, Charles River Associates; Adjunct Professor, Northwestern University School of Law.

We use physician data from the Area Resource File for 2000-2011 and malpractice policy data from the Database of State Tort Law Reforms. We study the impact of these caps using a reverse natural experiment, comparing physician supply in nine states enacting new caps to physician supply in ten states that had malpractice caps in place throughout the full time period. We use an event study to evaluate changes in physician labor compared to the prior year. We find evidence that non-economic damage caps increased the supply of high-risk physicians <35 years of age by 0.93 physicians per 100,000 people in the year after the caps were enacted. Non-economic damage caps were cumulatively associated with an increase of 2.1 high risk physicians <35 years of age per 100,000 people.

This article explores the history of higher education in China from its ancient academies to the modern Western-influenced university. Although the May Fourth Movement of 1919 recommended the complete elimination of traditional elements in Chinese culture, the past century has revealed problems with the wholesale embrace of Western institutions. Modern higher education, based first on European models and later on American colleges and universities, has been a major part of the transformation of China in the past century. But cracks have appeared in the facade. The balance between tradition and innovation has been lost, students are being produced by universities like products of a factory assembly line, and college graduates often remain unemployed or underemployed for years after completing a degree. To remedy this condition, a number of reformers in China are looking to the past for answers. The article discusses both official and private experiments with organic educational programs that aim at creating well-rounded persons, not merely students crammed with facts. A number of these new programs combine physical work with academic study as a reminder that life is a balance between mental and physical factors. More generally, the reform of modern education reclaims elements of the Chinese tradition that have been neglected, elements that recognize that education should ultimately aim at cultivating wisdom and not merely at accumulating knowledge.","[Fan, Meijun] Harbin Inst Technol, Ctr Construct Postmodern Studies, Philosophy, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Fan, Meijun] Inst Postmodern Dev China, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Wen, Hengfu; Yang, Li] Harbin Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Harbin, Peoples R China; [He, Jing] Harbin Normal Univ, Harbin, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Normal University; Harbin Normal University,"Wen, HF (通讯作者)，Harbin Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Harbin, Peoples R China.",wenhengfu@126.com,,,,,,,130,5,5,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Because knowledge sharing is local, knowledge diffuses gradually across an organization. Because knowledge sharing is costly, diffusion may stall, resulting in inefficiently fragmented knowledge. The theory suggests that excessively rapid organizational growth may result in fragmentation or in the abandonment of the organization's early knowledge, and that these effects may persist in the long-run, even after the initial period of growth has ended. To avoid fragmentation, highly productive firms should deliberately constrain firm growth and avoid acquisition-based growth strategies.","[Li, Hongyi] UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Li, HY (通讯作者)，UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",hongyi@gmail.com,"cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023",,MIT Sloan's Program on Innovation in Markets and Organizations,MIT Sloan's Program on Innovation in Markets and Organizations,This work was supported by MIT Sloan's Program on Innovation in Markets and Organizations.,,35,2,2,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this paper, we investigate whether the reduction in the circulation of cash on the streets associated with electronic benefit transfer (EBT) program implementation had an effect on crime. To address this question, we exploit the variation in the timing of EBT implementation across Missouri counties and counties in the states bordering Missouri. According to our results, the EBT program had a negative and significant effect on the overall crime rate and specifically for burglary, assault, and larceny. The point estimates indicate that the overall crime rate decreased by 9.2 percent in response to the EBT program.

A wide range of measures have been used over many years to combat this scourge. One of these measures is social marketing communication campaigns. Whether these campaigns are effective has been the subject of some debate. Some of the questions that arise are: What kind of advertising appeals (for instance, informational versus emotional) should be used? Which elements should form part of such campaigns? Some argue that pictures are more effective. Others believe that text-based messages are more effective. Regardless of how these campaigns are structured, they have very little chance of success if they are unable at least to cause arousal (activation) among the target audience. Not only does emotional arousal increase engagement, enhance information-processing and render communication memorable, it also helps to increase the mental accessibility of related knowledge. Aim: In this exploratory study, the ability of fear-based pictures and text messages on cigarette packaging to create emotional arousal among consumers is explored. Methods: Galvanic skin response and eye-tracking methodologies were used. Results: The results indicate that both fear-based pictures and fear-based text messages activated arousal among consumers. Conclusion: The extent of arousal is influenced (at least to some extent) by both gender and whether or not the viewer is a smoker.","[Boshoff, Christo; Toerien, Lucea] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Boshoff, C (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Business Management, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",cboshoff@sun.ac.za,,"Toerien, Lucea/0000-0001-6554-8729",National Research Foundation,National Research Foundation,"The contributions of Rafal Ohme and Michal Matukin (both of whom are from the Neurohme Laboratory in Warsaw, Poland) and Stephanie Buhrer of the Department of Business Management at Stellenbosch University in the design and execution of the study are gratefully acknowledged.

The models possess an unrestricted covariance matrix, but also have certain structural elements that are common to all series, which is proved to be both necessary and sufficient to ensure that the predictions of shares are invariant to the choice of base series. The framework includes a computationally efficient maximum likelihood approach to estimation, relying on exponential smoothing methods, which can be adapted to handle series that start late or finish early (new or withdrawn products).

The majority of LGD research is based on the corporate bond market and few studies focus on the LGD of bank loans even in Japan because of the lack of available public data on bank loan losses. Consequently, knowledge concerning Japanese bank loan LGD is scarce. This study uses Japanese bank loan data to analyze the influencing factors of LGD and to develop a (multi-stage) model to predict LCD and expected loss (EL). We found that collateral, guarantees, and loan size impact LGD.

Among the different decisional aspects related to rail transportation planning, in this paper the problem of optimizing train loading operations in container terminals is addressed. In such terminals, the timing of the train loading process is crucial, together with the necessity of maximizing the number of containers to be loaded on trains. Consequently, this has an impact on the economy of rail transport and, therefore, on its competitiveness. An optimization problem is stated for determining the optimal train loading plan in order to maximize the number of containers loaded and minimize the set-up operations necessary for adapting wagons configurations to the various containers to be loaded. In addition to an optimal approach, a heuristic procedure is defined for solving the proposed optimization problem. The comparison among the two approaches shows very close performances both in terms of computational time and quality of the obtained solutions. From a practical standpoint, this research could provide a decision support system to real container terminal managers, in order to help them speeding up and optimizing rail operations and, consequently, increase the rail quota and decrease operative costs.","[Anghinolfi, Davide; Caballini, Claudia] Univ Genoa, Dept Comp Sci Bioengn Robot & Syst Engn, DIBRIS, Via Opera Pia 13, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Caballini, Claudia] Univ Genoa, CIELI, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Anghinolfi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Comp Sci Bioengn Robot & Syst Engn, DIBRIS, Via Opera Pia 13, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",davide.anghinolfi@unige.it; daudia.caballini@cieli.unige.it,,,,,,,32,0,0,3,26,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This paper investigates the role played by health insurance in the relationship between parental morbidity and child work decisions. We use a propensity score matching technique combined with hurdle models, using data from Rwanda. The results show that parental health shocks have a substantial influence on child work when households do not have health insurance. Depending on the gender of the sick parent, there is a substitution effect not only between the parent and the child on the labor market, but also between the time the child spends on different work activities. Altogether, results reveal that health insurance protects children against child work in the presence of parental health shocks.","[Woode, Maame Esi] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, ORS PACA, Marseille, France; [Bousmah, Marwan-al-Qays; Boucekkine, Raouf] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Bousmah, Marwan-al-Qays; Boucekkine, Raouf] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Boucekkine, Raouf] Aix Marseille Univ, IMeRA, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Boucekkine, R (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.;Boucekkine, R (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, 2 Rue Charite, F-13002 Marseille, France.",raouf.boucekkine@univ-amu.fr,"Bousmah, Marwân-al-Qays/B-7676-2018; Woode, Maame Esi/ABB-1374-2021","Bousmah, Marwân-al-Qays/0000-0001-5346-5184; Woode, Maame Esi/0000-0001-9138-8853",,,,,18,3,3,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

It analyses two countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) region, two from the Western Balkans and two EU Member States from South East Europe. The analysis reveals differences between the country groups in the extent of institutional convergence, in perceptions of corruption and in the pace of democratic consolidation. Analysis of changes in a newly constructed index of institutional quality in the public sector reveals a further falling behind the EU in some key dimensions. We conclude that the EU did not play an important role as a transformative power' in the two ENP countries over the period up to 2012, and that the process of institutional reform was incomplete due to an absence of a clear European perspective.","[Bartlett, Will] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England; [Cuckovic, Nevenka; Jurlin, Kresimir] Inst Dev & Int Relat, Dept Int Econ & Polit Relat, Zagreb, Croatia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Institute for Development & International Relations,"Bartlett, W (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London, England.",w.j.bartlett@lse.ac.uk; nena@irmo.hr; kreso@irmo.hr,"Cuckovic, Nevenka/I-2644-2019; Bartlett, Will/A-7342-2013; Bartlett, William/H-5858-2019","Cuckovic, Nevenka/0000-0002-0028-2015; Bartlett, Will/0000-0002-6775-4339;",,,,,33,3,3,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Our focus is on Mongolia, where two extremely severe winters caused mass livestock mortality. We use household panel data with information on households' preshock location, combined with historic district-level livestock census data and climate data. Our econometric strategy exploits exogenous variation in shock intensity across space and time, using a difference-in-differences approach. Results indicate that individuals who experience the shock while of schooling age and living in severely affected districts are significantly less likely to complete mandatory education, both in the long and medium terms. The effects are driven by individuals from herding households, while no significant effects are found for individuals from nonherding households. This finding renders it unlikely that extreme winters affect education through school closures during extreme climatic conditions, to which all children were exposed. Moreover, there is no evidence for a differential impact of extreme weather events by gender. This suggests that the effects are not mainly channeled through increased child labor in herding but rather they are related to reductions in household income.","[Groppo, Valeria; Kraehnert, Kati] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,,kkraehnert@diw.de,,"Kraehnert, Kati/0000-0001-7319-9581",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LA1126A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding line Economics of Climate Change, research grant 01LA1126A.",,58,15,18,7,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Truck driver fatigue has been cited as a major reason for these accidents Federal Motor Carrier Safety & Administration, 2015 (). In July 2013, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association (FMCSA) revised its hours of service (HOS) regulatory policy, which restricts the number of duty and driving hours a truck driver can operate in order to reduce the fatigue related accidents involving trucks. The revision changed the unlimited restart (allows truck drivers to reset their duty time log back to zero) provision by restricting it to 1 restart per 168 h (1 week) and added that the restart must span two consecutive 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods. Lawmakers suspended these two aspects of the restart provision in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations act on December 16, 2014 until more analysis was completed on the efficacy of these regulations due to unintended consequences that allegedly negatively affected motorist's safety. Countering truck driver fatigue is an important issue and an extremely difficult task because of the many confounding aspects that can cause fatigue. The new regulation set forth in July 2013, was supposed to lessen fatigue and thus reduce accidents caused by truck drivers. The current HOS regulation was in place for approximately 16 months, producing enough data for a statistical analysis of its effects on truck driver safety. This research found that by comparing truck driving safety data prior to the change in July of 2013 (the unlimited restart provision) to truck driving safety data during the enactment of the 1 restart per 168-h restriction and 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. provision that the percent of accidents caused by truck drivers did not decrease. Furthermore, this research found that the HOS changes implemented on July 1, 2013 have not led to a significant change in accidents involved and caused by truck drivers. These results suggest that other factors appear to be linked to motorists' safety, rather than the updated HOS regulation.","[Anderson, Jason R.; Ogden, Jeffrey D.; Cunningham, William A.; Schubert-Kabban, Christine] Air Force Inst Technol, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA",Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT),"Anderson, JR (通讯作者)，Air Force Inst Technol, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.",Jason.anderson@afit.edu; jeffrey.ogden@afit.edu; william.cunningham@afit.edu; christine.schubert@afit.edu,,"Ogden, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9101-1703",,,,,108,7,9,2,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The analysis considers three different regimes for provision of parking space: surface parking, underground parking, and structural parking, with the latter two regimes involving capital investment either in the form of an underground parking garage or an above-ground parking structure. Parking area is viewed as a dwelling attribute that, along with floor space, provides utility. In addition, road congestion in the neighborhood (which affects the commuting costs of local residents) depends on the average amount of off-street parking per dwelling, an externality that is ignored by profit-maximizing developers, making the equilibrium inefficient. The analysis explores the equilibrium spatial behavior of the two dwelling attributes as well as residential and parking structural density, and analysis of land rent shows which parking regimes are present in different parts of the city. Efficiency requires an increase in parking area per dwelling at each location, which can be achieved in a crude fashion by an MPR, whose effects are analyzed.","[Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Franco, Sofia F.] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jkbrueck@uci.edu,,,,,,,34,12,12,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

It focuses on the interaction of EV costs with Hawaii's rapid solar PV uptake, using a scenario planning approach for future fuel and electricity prices. EVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). We find that the total cost of ownership (TCO) of EVs tends to be higher than their internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) counterparts. Once accounting for the federal tax credit, however, some EVs become relatively cost-effective. Moreover, access to residential solar PV makes EVs quite attractive. Layering the federal EV subsidy with solar PV charging makes the full lifecycle cost of the Nissan Leaf about $1200 less expensive than the next lowest cost vehicle, the Toyota Corolla (over a 150,000-mile lifetime). Nonetheless, it may be too early to tout EVs in Hawaii as a GHG abatement strategy. Based on today's mix of electricity generation, the best performing PHEV and BEV emit 2 and 5 MTCO2, respectively, more over their lifetime than the best performing HEV. However, many EVs become on par with the high performing HEVs when considering Hawaii's adoption of aggressive renewable energy goals for the electric sector. If the electric sector meets its 2030 Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) target of 40% renewables through low carbon sources like wind and solar, the Toyota Plug-in Prius, Nissan Leaf and Toyota Prius become comparable in terms of their GHG impacts. Integrating residential solar PV, even for just weekend charging, makes all EVs outperform the Toyota Prius in regards to lifetime GHG emissions. In addition, at this level of charging from renewable sources of electricity, all BEVs now outperform PHEVs. The environmental benefits of EVs depend critically on the electricity system from which they derive their power. Given the wide variation in the mix of electricity generation throughout the U.S., and even throughout the day with the adoption of intermittent sources of renewable energy, additional policy tools are needed to match places and times with high levels of renewables with EV charging. In particular, we suggest that 1) a regional approach to EV subsidies that can account for the emissions intensity of electricity systems may be more appropriate than the current blunt federal tax credit; and 2) adoption of time-of-use pricing that accounts for GHG impacts may be critical to supporting EVs as a GHG abatement tool. Currently, however, EVs are a relatively costly GHG abatement strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis is based on a panel database and focuses on two objectives: to measure the long and short-term impact of GDP growth on unemployment over recent years for different categories of labour market participants (young, older and low educated workers) and to evaluate the relationship between mismatches related to skills (educational and occupational) and unemployment. One of the main conclusions is that unemployment rates of young and low educated workers are more responsive to economic growth variations both in the long and short run, while unemployment rates of older workers show a greater capacity of adjustment. In addition, occupational mismatches seem to have a significant long-term impact on the changes in unemployment of all categories of unemployed, whereas the short run effect is rather mixed, varying across countries. One explanation is the fact that during crisis, economy's structure tends to change more rapidly than labour market and educational system can adapt.","[Dimian, Gina Cristina; Begu, Liviu Stelian] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Econ Cybernet Stat & Informat, Piata Romana Sq 6,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Jablonsky, Josef] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dimian, GC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Econ Cybernet Stat & Informat, Piata Romana Sq 6,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",gina.dimian@csie.ase.ro; liviu.begu@csie.ase.ro; jablon@vse.cz,"Gina Cristina, Dimian/HOF-2342-2023; Jablonsky, Josef/U-2395-2018; Jablonsky, Josef/N-8711-2019","Jablonsky, Josef/0000-0003-0606-354X",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The research is supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project P402/12/G097 DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics.",,44,5,5,1,31,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive equipment is a major obstacle to IEQ performance evaluation. With the rapid development of wireless monitoring equipment in recent years, measuring various building parameters has become a less labor-intensive process. While sensors and logging device manufacturers have made products that are increasingly accurate and easy-to-use, making new devices for measuring IEQ is still largely in the hands of researchers. IEQ measurement requires a combination of devices and individual sensors to capture the state of IEQ in a space. This paper presents a review of the recent development on IEQ evaluation methods and tools, proposes a new approach of Smart IEQ online monitoring mobile unit on small, low-cost, and desk-based monitors with sensors for thermal comfort (air and radiant temperatures, air speed, and humidity), acoustics (SPL), lighting (Lux), and air quality (CO2, CO, TVOC, Formaldehyde, and PM10). The measurements are relayed wirelessly to a server within the building that transmits data through the wireless network which can in real-time be presented to an online IEQ dashboard in a control room or to a mobile phone by an application program.","[Kueankaeo, Chetnarong; Phdungsilp, Aumnad; Vorarat, Suparatchai; Areerakulkan, Natiapat] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Grad Programe Engn Management, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Kueankaeo, C (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Grad Programe Engn Management, Bangkok, Thailand.",kchetnarong@gmail.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,2,3,VOLKSON PRESS,KUALA LUMPUR,"C-3A-15 CENTRIO PANTAI HILLPARK, JALAN PANTAI MURNI, BANGSAR SOUTH,, KUALA LUMPUR, WILAYAH PERSEKUTUAN KUALA LUMPUR 59200, MALAYSIA",,,978-1-948012-02-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,286,288,,10.26480/icemi.01.2017.286.288,0.0,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461012100099,0

In order to reach the goal of this paper and verify stated hypotheses, statistical tests of significance and binary logistic regression were used. The conducted study revealed that supporting family is a strong motive, which has an impact on having or not consumer or mortgage loan. Moreover, the willingness to help family financially is much more important than any other financial reason or obstacle.

The results show that environmental self-accountability has positive impact on green consumption behavior. Green consumption tendency plays a role as intermediary. With the higher degree of consumer impression management, the positive impacts of environmental self-accountability to green consumption tendency will become stronger, otherwise weaker. The more the consumers recognize the hedonic attributes of products, the stronger the positive impacts of environmental self-accountability on green consumption tendency will be stronger, otherwise weaker.

More recently, with the decline of the investors' demand to develop public real-estate assets, new approaches to property-value creation have emerged. These new processes are focused on the demand side, through self-organized grass-roots participation using the assets for profit and not-for-profit purposes.

A special attention has been paid to the methodological approach more than to the results, with a focus on uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The latter one has been developed by the use of the SimLab (http:// ipsc. jrc. ec. europa. eu), which has allowed to estimate the probability distribution function of the composite indicator and to point out the field of variation of its variables. Lombardy Region has been selected as a pilot case study since it is one of the Italian regions with the highest infrastructural development. The results show that the Composite Indicator of Territorial Vulnerability applied to municipalities in the Lombardy Region has a limited variation range, and thus low uncertainty.

Underlying reasons include that some kinds benefit (or cost) might be discounted at a lower rate than that used for others: in particular, that rates for carbon values and environmental amenities might be less than that for timber. A lengthening sequence of rotations then arises, whether the benefits are consumptive ones realised at the rotation end, or non-consumptive ones whose annual value increases through the rotation. A timber discount rate lower than that for non-consumptive benefits leads to a shortening sequence of rotations.

With the shift from manufacturing-based economies in the developing world toward service-based industries, including tourism, a reliance on the tourism industry may erode economic stability in tourism-based countries, making them more prone to fall into a recession due to higher risks. In this paper, we wish to emphasise the positive impact of tourism specialisation indices in the international economy on the probability occurrence of a so-called Great Recession. This article uses a multilevel survival analysis and a generalised linear mixed-effect (GLMM) structure modelling to investigate the impact of tourism development on the probability of recession frequency (risk in terms of months of duration and severity), by using data collected from 2007 to 2013 from 71 countries around the world, to see if recession frequency is positively correlated with the various indicators of tourism development. Two GLMMs were fitted to this data: logistic regression and count regression with a Poisson distribution. Results for both regressions show considerable evidence that the ratio between the number of overnight stays and the resident population and travel services as a percentage of commercial service exports positively impacts the probability for a country (from our sample) to experience a recession event and can make recession worse in terms of severity, measured in months.","[Sergo, Zdravko] Inst Agr & Tourism Porec, Karla Huguesa 8, Porec 52440, Croatia; [Grzinic, Jasmina] Univ Jurja Dobrile Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Cevra, Mirela Sucic] Tumlare Corp, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec,"Sergo, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Tourism Porec, Karla Huguesa 8, Porec 52440, Croatia.",zdravko@iptpo.hr; jasmina.grzinic@unipu.hr; Mirela.Sucic@tumlare.com,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,7,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The business situation in the area of occupational safety and health (OSH) services was investigated in order to assess possibilities to start up this kind of commercial activity. The proposed methodology of assessment is tested only on the basis of occupational safety and health services, but the sequence and the content of the provided actions for assessment may be also used for initiating any other kinds of business. Systematic approach has been applied to searching for solutions primarily to assess general aspects which are then narrowed down to the assessment of smaller issues. Suitability of theoretical decisions has been tested in real business conditions. In order to assess the benevolence of business conditions in the current situation before starting up a certain business, the article provides certain assessment measures and their application techniques. Applying the chosen methodology may help to start a new business smoother, develop the existing one and thus achieve better results.","[Tuncikiene, Zivile; Drejeris, Rolandas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Social Econ & Management, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Tuncikiene, Z (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Social Econ & Management, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",zivile.tuncikiene@vgtu.lt; rolandas.drejeris@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

First of all, this study is based on literature reviews to develop a research model and questionnaire. Then, we collected 550 samples, used narrative statistical analysis, reliability and validity analysis and linear regression analysis in the statistical analysis. The results show that entrepreneurism has no effect on employee creativity. Employee creativity has a positive impact on the team. However, motivational interrelationships are not affected. Learning goal orientation not only has a correlating effect on entrepreneurism and employee creativity, but also between employee creativity and team effectiveness.

The article analyses survey data on China that were obtained by the World Bank in 2012; these data are representative of numerous small and medium-sized firms. The study first analyses the situation of firms using trade credit for purchases and the proportion of trade credit in firms' working capital and subsequently establishes a regression model to investigate the interaction among bank credit, financial obstacles, and trade credit. Evidence shows that firms in China are generally financed by bank credit. Trade credit is positively correlated with bank credit. Firms with financial obstacles use supplier financing to complement bank credit. Trade credit can alleviate financing constraints to some extent but not enough to replace bank credit. Firms' access to formal finance should be facilitated.","[Wu, Zheng-cheng; Chen, Jin-long] Huaqiao Univ, Coll Business Adm, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zheng-cheng] Quanzhou Normal Univ, TSL Sch Business & Informat Technol, Quanzhou 362000, Fujian, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University; Quanzhou Normal University,"Wu, ZC (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Coll Business Adm, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Wu, ZC (通讯作者)，Quanzhou Normal Univ, TSL Sch Business & Informat Technol, Quanzhou 362000, Fujian, Peoples R China.",wuzhcheng@126.com; jinlong@hqu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571074],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71571074).,,23,3,3,1,23,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

How to optimize the total supply chain profit in the centralized and the decentralized decisions is analyzed by using Stackelberg game, which is also a new problem compared with the previous studies. The results obtained are as follows. In the centralized decision, the supplier needs to adjust the channel price if the disruptions satisfy a given condition. If the disruptions satisfy other conditions, the supplier needs to change both the channel retail price and the production quantity. In the decentralized decision, an adjusted revenue-sharing contract, a new supply contract, can coordinate the disrupted supply chain.","[Zhang, Jun] Kunming Met Coll, Logist Engn & Management Fac, 388 Xuefu Rd, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hong] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Chen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zjun434@sina.com.cn; chenh@uestc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472026]; Kunming Metallurgy College [14B005],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Kunming Metallurgy College,The research was sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71472026) and Research Fund of Kunming Metallurgy College (14B005).,,16,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-407-1,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,168.0,,,,,,285,290,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9GO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416079900062,0

Our Tobit regressions find strong evidence in support of the energy-ladder hypothesis. A one standard-deviation increase in household wealth is associated with a 15% decrease in a household's daily fuelwood consumption and a 3% increase in its daily coal consumption. Meanwhile, off-farm labor supply and the education level of household members have significantly negative impacts on household fuelwood consumption. These findings suggest that economic development, either through wealth growth, through off-farm labor market development, or through human capital accumulation, can help accelerate the process of rural China's energy transition.","[Zhao, Qiran; Chen, Qihui; Xiao, Yitian; Tian, Guoqiang] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 17 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xueling] Minist Agr PR China, Foreign Econ Cooperat Ctr, 11 Nongzhanguan Nanli, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiming] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, 17 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; China Agricultural University,"Liu, QM (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, 17 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhaoqiran@cau.edu.cn; henqihui2002@126.com; xyt@cau.edu.cn; tiangq@cau.edu.cn; chuxueling@163.com; liuqm@cau.edu.cn,"zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023; QI, LIU/IQR-4870-2023; li, yihua/JKJ-1325-2023; zhao, qiran/GSI-5490-2022; Chen, Qihui/I-2813-2019","Chen, Qihui/0000-0002-0944-0470; Zhao, Qiran/0000-0003-1526-2057",National Science Foundation of China [71603261]; Ministry of education of Humanities and Social Science project [16YJC880107],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of education of Humanities and Social Science project,We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by National Science Foundation of China (Grants: 71603261); The Ministry of education of Humanities and Social Science project (Grants: 16YJC880107).,,31,35,35,2,16,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The pooled-OLS regressions focusing on mean effects present the robust evidence of a positive relationship between R&D intensity on firm performance, and the further pooled-quantile regressions portraying the relative importance of explanatory variables at different points of the performance distribution show that the R&D intensity exhibits a stronger impact on the better-performance firms.

However, only few attempts have been made to reassess the concept, to improve its methodology, and to reflect on its empirical application. The aim of this article is to revise the original concept of institutional thickness. We draw on and seek to contribute to current work in economic geography and related disciplines on the role of organizations and institutions in regional development. We identify some crucial limitations and provide suggestions for how they can be addressed. It is argued that much can be gained by (1) explicitly elaborating on the relation between the organizational and institutional dimensions of thickness, (2) moving beyond overly static views on thickness, (3) developing a multiscalar approach to thickness, and (4) identifying features for assessing thickness in absolute and relative terms.","[Zukauskaite, Elena] Halmstad Univ, Sch Hlth & Welf, S-30118 Halmstad, Sweden; [Trippl, Michaela] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Plechero, Monica] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Halmstad University; University of Vienna; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Zukauskaite, E (通讯作者)，Halmstad Univ, Sch Hlth & Welf, S-30118 Halmstad, Sweden.",elena.zukauskaite@hh.se; michaela.trippl@univie.ac.at; monica.plechero@unive.it,"Plechero, Monica/AFO-7951-2022","Plechero, Monica/0000-0001-8854-1343; Trippl, Michaela/0000-0001-9779-4836; Zukauskaite, Elena/0000-0002-0066-3619",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation MMW [2012.0194],Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation MMW,This work has been made possible by support from the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation MMW 2012.0194.,,82,98,104,2,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

However, as the latest National Travel Survey (NTS) reveals, the number of journeys made by bike in the UK has remained steadfastly around only 2% (Department for Transport [DfT], 2018a). By using documentary analysis of the available official policy documents and statements, the aim of this paper is to make sense of the policies that have been published concerning active travel (AT) in England. This is done from a figurational sociological perspective. Three key themes emerge from the analysis: (1) the rhetorical, advisory level of the vast majority of the policies; (2) the reliance on a wide network of local authorities to implement AT policy; and (3) the focus placed on individuals to change their behaviour. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that despite a large number of policy publications from a range of government departments claiming to promote AT, little has actually changed in this time period in terms of a national agenda. Despite the successive policies, it seems there is little appetite on behalf of recent governments to make widespread infrastructural changes, where instead the focus has largely been on persuading the individual to seek more active modes of travel, increasingly for their own, individual 'health' gains.","[Bloyce, Daniel; White, Chris] Univ Chester, Dept Sport & Exercise Sci, Parkgate Rd, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England",University of Chester,"Bloyce, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chester, Dept Sport & Exercise Sci, Parkgate Rd, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England.",d.bloyce@chester.ac.uk,"Bloyce, Daniel/W-4233-2019","White, Chris/0000-0003-4710-4723; Bloyce, Daniel/0000-0003-4114-3588",,,,,99,4,4,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Critics, we argue, have misinterpreted the original causal hypothesis. Economic Neo-functionalism specified a dynamic rather than time-invariant relationship between EU law use and transnational economic exchange. Yet both proponents and critics of economic Neo-functionalism have failed to adequately address the problem posed by endogeneity. Revisiting the neo-functionalist trade hypothesis, we attempt to untangle cause and effect using Bayesian instrumental variable estimation. Our research shows that intra-EU trade remains a positive and significant predictor of referral dynamics even when controlling for reverse causality and omitted variable bias. The impact of intra-EU trade on Article 267 proceedings has declined substantively over time. But this result is consistent with the neo-functionalist formulation of the trade hypothesis, which characterised intra-EU trade as an initial catalyst rather than as a constant driver of legal integration.

J,"Evison, DC",,,,"Evison, David C.",,,Estimating annual investment returns from forestry and agriculture in New Zealand,JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forestry; Agriculture; Investment; Investment return; Financial statements; Internal rate of return,,"This paper describes a method of estimating annual investment returns from forest growing businesses in New Zealand, using financial statement data. The method is also applied to survey data (derived from farm financial statements) published by New Zealand pastoral farming sector organisations. After data are adjusted for inflation, the total investment return is calculated as the sum of the cash return on assets, and the percentage change in asset value. The paper demonstrates that the total investment return calculated in this way is equivalent to the internal rate of return (IRR), for a single period of one year. The direct equivalence between this measure and the single-period IRR (calculated using discounted cash-flow analysis) is demonstrated algebraically and by example. Calculated values for forestry show a wide range of investment returns for different businesses in any one year, although there has been a general trend for total returns to increase for forestry businesses since about 2008. Investment returns for dairy and sheep and beef generally follow similar trends, with dairy providing a higher return on average than sheep and beef over the period studied. The data for forestry and agriculture are not directly comparable, since the forestry data are extracted directly from the financial statements of individual businesses and the farming data are derived through a process of averaging financial returns from a large number of farms, with the objective of providing typical returns for benchmarking. The scale of the operations are also significantly different, with the benchmark dairy farm being 148 ha, the sheep farm 764 ha and the forest businesses ranging from 21,000 ha to 150,000 ha (most recent year in all cases). The measure of total return used in this paper is attractive because it means the same measure can be used for evaluating existing businesses as would have been used to justify the initial set up of the business, or any projects that contributed to the business along the way. This provides a measure for ex post evaluation of existing investments that is consistent with one of the ex-ante decision criteria used at the time investment decisions are made. The method also provides separate estimates of the income or productive return, and the (usually) unrealised change in asset value. The paper demonstrates that the method can be applied to either individual company or industry average financial data equally easily. This method provides a viable alternative to using survey data to estimate annual investment returns.","[Evison, David C.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Forestry, Christchurch, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Evison, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Sch Forestry, Christchurch, New Zealand.",david.evison@canterbury.ac.nz,,,,,,,18,5,5,0,8,"ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG",JENA,"OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, 07705 JENA, GERMANY",1104-6899,1618-1530,,J FOREST ECON,J.

However, the competition that existed in long-distance services in Poland between 2009 and 2015 has yet to be analysed. Surprisingly, there was fierce market rivalry between two state-owned enterprises answering to different levels of government: PKP Intercity (the central-government-run incumbent) and Przewozy Regionalne (a challenger owned by regional authorities). In comparison with the experience of other countries, this challenge was exceptional in terms of territorial reach and acquired market share (33%). In the polycentric Polish network, the challenger's services (branded under the name of Interregio) not only served up to 62% of all possible direct connections between the largest Polish cities, but also reached into more peripheral regional centres. Interestingly, we found no evidence of responsive price cutting in regular fares. In order to counteract aggressive low-cost entry, the incumbent opted for a differentiation strategy combined with a strategic use of political action. We found that although the incumbent's strategic behaviour did indeed contribute to the challenger's withdrawal from the market in 2015, its failure was mainly the result of a departure from the principal source of competitive advantage.","[Krol, Marcin] Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Taczanowski, Jakub; Kolos, Arkadiusz] Jagiellonian Univ Cracow, Inst Geog & Spatial Management, Ul Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Jagiellonian University,"Król, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",marcin.krol@sgh.waw.pl; jakub.taczanowski@uj.edu.pl; arkadiusz.kolos@uj.edu.pl,"Kołoś, Arkadiusz/M-8598-2019; Taczanowski, Jakub/AEO-3925-2022; Taczanowski, Jakub/AAK-2831-2020","Kołoś, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-3606-7122; Taczanowski, Jakub/0000-0001-9421-5982; Krol, Marcin/0000-0002-1093-6086",,,,,60,11,11,1,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-8859,1875-7979,,RES TRANSP ECON,Res.

The paper documents evidence that on average, technical reserves account for 45.41% of total assets, made of 19.79% in unearned premiums and 25.62% in outstanding claims. Using panel regression techniques, the findings suggest that general insurers manipulate their earnings through reserve provisions to smooth income and tax considerations. In addition, underwriting risk and reinsurance increases technical reserves, whereas market concentration induces high provisioning for outstanding claims.

Rising interest on inclusive development of cities at different levels of urban policy involves new opportunities and challenges for increasingly urban societies. In cities of the Global South, in addition to institutional and physical challenges for the development of efficient and inclusive public transport, local governments face the challenge of making public transport affordable for a large share of the population in conditions of poverty. In order to meet these challenges, several public transport systems throughout have implemented targeted subsidies for specific social groups such as students, the elderly and people with reduced mobility, and more recently for the poor. The government of Bogota has implemented a pro-poor public transport subsidy scheme that aims at alleviating the financial burden of poor households for accessing the city's public transport system. This research develops an analysis of the effects of such subsidy from an accessibility perspective using potential accessibility measures to employment opportunities and assess its impact on equity. The research builds on the hypothesis that accessibility is a multi-dimensional construct that can benefit from the decrease in economic as much as gains in time costs. Results from the analysis show that both the current structure of the pro-poor subsidies in Bogota and alternative scenarios for increasing its coverage are progressive, improving accessibility and equity for those with access to the subsidy. The paper provides valuable insights for the analysis of similar policies in other urban contexts in the Global South.","[Guzman, Luis A.] Univ Los Andes, Grp Sostenibilidad Urbana & Reg, SUR, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambiental, Edificio Mario Laserna Cra 1 Este 19a-40, Bogota, Colombia; [Oviedo, Daniel] UCL, Dev Planning Unit, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); University of London; University College London,"Guzman, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Grp Sostenibilidad Urbana & Reg, SUR, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambiental, Edificio Mario Laserna Cra 1 Este 19a-40, Bogota, Colombia.",la.guzman@uniandes.edu.co; d.oviedo.11@ucl.ac.uk,"Guzman, Luis A./F-7201-2019; Oviedo Hernandez, Daniel/AGJ-6328-2022; Guzmán, Luis/HLH-3515-2023","Guzman, Luis A./0000-0002-6487-7579; Oviedo Hernandez, Daniel/0000-0002-5692-6633;",World Bank,World Bank(The World Bank India),"We would like to express our gratitude to the World Bank, for the funding a project called Accessibility and affordability impact evaluation of Bogota's SITP, which was the origin for the development of this paper.",,44,108,114,9,81,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

The study relies on six datasets of driving data collected monitoring 508,607 conventional fuel vehicles in six European areas and a dataset of synthetic data from 700,000 vehicles in a seventh European area. Sources representing the actual driving behaviour of PHEV together with the WLTP European utility factor are adopted as term of comparison. The results show that different datasets of driving data can yield to different estimates of the utility factor. The SAE J2841 standard method results to be representative of a large variety of behaviours of PHEVs and BEVs' drivers, characterised by a fully-charged battery at the beginning of the trip sequence, thus being representative for fuel economy and emission estimates in the early phase deployment of EVs, charged at home and overnight. However the results show that the SAE J2841 utility factor might need to be revised to account for more complex future scenarios, such as necessity-driven recharge behaviour with less than one recharge per day or a fully deployed recharge infrastructure with more than one recharge per day.","[Paffumi, Elena; De Gennaro, Michele; Martini, Giorgio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Energy Transport & Climate C, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Paffumi, E (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Energy Transport & Climate C, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",elena.paffumi@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,52,19,22,1,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

It is a multi-objective optimization problem which includes minimization of the bus costs and total travel time for all students. The model is based on bus route planning according to changes in school starting times, so the buses can make more than one route. The methodology is based on the School Bus Routing Problem, so that routes from different schools within a given time window are connected, and within the problem constraints so system costs are minimized. The proposed model has been programmed for application in any generic case. This is a multi-objective problem, for which there are several possible solutions, depending on the weight assigned to each of the variables involved, economic versus social point of view. Therefore, the proposed model will be useful in school transport planning policy, given that it is a support model for making decisions, which seek efficiency in economic and social terms. The model has been applied in some schools located in an area of Cantabria (Spain), resulting in 71 possible optimal options, which minimize school transport cost between 2.7% and 35.1% regarding current school transport routes, with different school start time and minimum travel time for students.","[Ezquerro Eguizabal, Sara; Moura Berodia, Jose Luis; Ibeas Portilla, Angel; Benavente Ponce, Juan] Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Eguizábal, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Santander, Spain.",ezquerros@unican.es,"Moura, Jose L./G-1975-2010","Moura, Jose L./0000-0001-5645-8289; Ezquerro, Sara/0000-0003-4580-1541",,,,,22,10,13,6,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-070X,1879-310X,,TRANSPORT POLICY,Transp.

Reducing transfer disruption in multimodal trips is a key element for ensuring seamless mobility in big cities. Based on previous research (Hernandez and Monzon, 2016), this paper aims to explore how attitudes towards several service factors can predict general satisfaction with a transport interchange. It also analyses how personal and trip characteristics affect the evaluation of some variables, and examine the relationship between waiting time and perceived quality. A two-step methodology (personal and online interview) was applied to a representative sample of 740 users (54% female, 55% travelling for work purposes). The model was tested with path analysis and showed a satisfactory statistical fit. The model performed well when predicting general satisfaction with the Moncloa transport interchange (Madrid, Spain). The outputs indicate that Information and Safety and Security factors predicted 49% of general satisfaction. The results also revealed a strong association between Design and Environmental quality, although these factors do not affect general satisfaction directly, but through the perception of Information and Safety & Security, which act as mediator variables. Time spent queuing inside the interchange is negatively correlated with Information and Safety & Security, while the age of participants negatively affects Information, indicating that older individuals have some cognitive problems with accessibility. Our data shows gender differences in safety perception, since women (particularly younger women) feel less safe inside the interchange. The results point to a number of priority measures to enhance the perceived quality and efficiency of interchanges.","[Lois, David] UNED, Social Psychol Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Monzon, MonzonAndres; Hernandez, HernandezSara] UPM, TRANSyT, Transport Res Ctr, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Lois, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Fac Psicol, C Juan Rosal 10, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",davidlois@psi.uned.es,"Monzón, Andrés/M-3803-2017; Lois, David/E-3900-2017","Lois, David/0000-0003-2858-6464",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the European Commission, as this research was made possible thanks to data collected in the City-HUB project of the EU 7th Framework Programme.

The competitive nature of the environment under which the banking sector operates is of paramount importance. Aim: The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between competition, efficiency and soundness in the South African banking sector. Setting: The setting for this study was the South African banking sector. Methods: We used a data set of 17 local and international banks for the period 2004-2015 and stochastic frontier models to analyse efficiency. Results: Results show that the impact of competition on efficiency depended on the measure of competition used. When using the Lerner index there was a negative effect of competition on efficiency while the opposite was true when using the theoretically robust Boone indicator. Conclusion: In the case of bank soundness, competition using the Boone indicator is negatively related to the Z score, implying that competition enhances bank soundness and these results supported the prudent and efficient management hypothesis.","[Moyo, Busani] Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Moyo, B (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",moyob@unisa.ac.za,,,National Research Foundation (NRF),National Research Foundation (NRF),"Besides thanks to the National Research Foundation (NRF) for funding and the anonymous reviewers, there is no other person to acknowledge who assisted with this study.",,65,21,24,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Standard remedies can compensate plaintiffs for unknown harms, but it is expensive to do so. Damage awards will generally undercompensate or overcompensate a plaintiff whose true harm is unknown, while equitable remedies that provide more tailored compensation are generally wasteful. In this article I develop a novel remedy that compensates plaintiffs for unobservable private values at the lowest possible cost to the defendant. This remedy consists of offering the plaintiff the choice between intermediate damages and an inalienable injunction that restores the underlying harm at the conclusion of the trial. I show that this remedy is robust to errors by the court and potential post judgment renegotiation. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this remedy reduces litigants' incentives to lie during trial. Finally, I consider ex ante deterrence and show conditions under which the remedy improves social welfare relative to optimal damages.","[Atkinson, Nathan] Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Atkinson, Nathan] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Atkinson, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nathana@stanford.edu,,"Atkinson, Nathan/0000-0002-0820-6084",Stanford Graduate School of Business; Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; McCoy Center for Ethics in Society; John M.

Clear signs for this phenomenon are, in both the global north and south, the emergence and increasing networking of several food movements, which put forward claims for food justice, food democracy and food sovereignty. Thus, they fight against the neoliberal order and the corporate system of food production. A special feature of these movements is that they do not only engage in classic forms of political protest, e.g. demonstrations and campaigns, but also in self-organized and self-determined economic activities such as community-supported agriculture, agro-ecological farming and various arrangements of food sharing. In consideration of the respective literature, I conceptualize these parallel economies as alternative food geographies, since they pursue to varying degrees the goal of overcoming the capitalist logic of exploitation and aim at a re-spatialization of food production and related supply chains. However, despite the high level of international attention, only a few publications explicitly discuss the normative foundation of the food movements, i.e. the meaning of sovereignty, justice and democracy, which are subject to controversial debates within political theory. This article aims at encouraging a theoretical debate regarding this research gap. Thereby, it focuses on possible contradictions these complex ideals might entail in the context of this thematic area. At the same time, it intends to provide an extended basis for empirical research on the food movements and alternative food geographies. In doing so, I discuss approaches from rural sociology, human geography and political theory and pay special attention to Nancy Fraser's theory of justice. Originating from Critical Theory, her thoughts offer a differentiated perspective on the multi-faceted content and the contradictory nature of social justice, which also facilitates the examination of the food movements' claims in their practical unfolding. In addition, Fraser's theory ties in well with human geography, since it does not only consider the contentual aspects of social justice but also pays attention to its spatial dimension in an era of globalization.","[Fladvad, Benno] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Geog Inst, AG Kulturgeog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Fladvad, B (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Geog Inst, AG Kulturgeog, Ludewig Meyn Str 14, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",fladvad@geographie.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,92,3,3,2,46,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

As part of the initial information collection process, the paper is based on real-world experiences and evidence, applies a comparative multi-case study to 22 cities in 14 countries. A framework is used for analysis, which includes identifying technical components that require investment, non-reimbursable funds and investment capital applied, and legal arrangements supporting the implementation. Results show that three key elements are seen in electric bus adoption across the globe, despite regional differences. First, both public and private grants, when dedicated to cleaning the fleet, appear as a strong factor underpinning existing clean bus systems. Second, less costly sources of financing, which may come from different stakeholders, can reduce financial risks, and it is where innovation can happen. Third, innovative ways of structuring contractual implementation effectively connect stakeholders and involve third-party players, which leads to shared risks, increased efficiency and improved performance.","[Li, Xiangyi; Castellanos, Sebastian; Maassen, Anne] World Resources Inst, 10 G St NE Suite 800, Washington, DC 20002 USA",,"Li, XY (通讯作者)，World Resources Inst, 10 G St NE Suite 800, Washington, DC 20002 USA.",xiangyi.li@wri.org; scastellanos@wri.org; amaassen@wri.org,"Castellanos, Sebastian/GRF-6649-2022","Castellanos, Sebastian/0000-0002-1283-2600","Climate Technology Transfer Mechanisms and Networks in Latin America; Caribbean Project; Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative, an initiative of WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities and C40 Cities - Citi Foundation; World Resources Institute; Global Environment Facility","Climate Technology Transfer Mechanisms and Networks in Latin America; Caribbean Project; Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative, an initiative of WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities and C40 Cities - Citi Foundation; World Resources Institute; Global Environment Facility","This research was supported by the Climate Technology Transfer Mechanisms and Networks in Latin America and the Caribbean Project implemented by the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Resources Institute, with funds from the Global Environment Facility; Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative, an initiative of WRI Ross Center for Sustainable Cities and C40 Cities, funded by the Citi Foundation; and other WRI donors who have made this work possible.

Taking advantage of the context of multilocation firms in technology clusters, we consider the joint role of geographic and technological distances by focusing on a salient feature of clusters: firms' concern about knowledge appropriation. Specifically, we analyze how a firm's choice of technological distance from local entities is affected by the competitive environment in the cluster as well as its intra-firm technological structure across clusters. Empirical findings based on the global semiconductors industry support our theory that, with stronger local competition, an innovating entity will increase its technological distance from neighbors to reduce unintended knowledge spillovers. However, the technological distance is smaller when the entity is part of a multilocation firm, has a larger technological distance from other locations within the firm and has stronger intra-firm integration across locations. We argue that these features limit knowledge spillovers and, hence, reduce firms' reliance on technological distance as a strategy for knowledge appropriation.","[Wang, Shixiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Minyuan] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Pennsylvania,"Zhao, MY (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",myzhao@wharton.upenn.edu,"Zhao, Minyuan/GZL-3641-2022",,,,,,92,15,17,8,77,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Given the global public good nature of climate change mitigation and the important cross-country differences in marginal abatement costs, distributing mitigation efforts across countries could substantially lower the overall cost of implementing climate policy. However, abating emissions abroad instead of domestically may face important political and popular resistance. We ran a lab experiment with more than 300 participants and asked them to choose between a domestic and an international reforestation project. We tested the effect of three informational treatments on the allocation of participants' endowment between the domestic and the international project. The treatments consisted in: (1) making more salient the cost-effectiveness gains associated with offsetting carbon abroad; (2) providing guarantees on the reliability of reforestation programmes; (3) stressing local ancillary benefits associated with domestic offset projects. We found that stressing the cost-effectiveness of the reforestation programme abroad did increase its support, the economic argument in favour of offsetting abroad being otherwise overlooked by participants. We relate this finding to the recent literature on the drivers of public support for climate policies, generally pointing to a gap between people's preferences and economists' prescriptions.

Absent intragenerational heterogeneity, we show that a benevolent government has no welfare justification for introducing public pensions alongside thriving family compacts since the former is associated with inefficiently low fertility. This result hinges critically on a fiscal externality-the inability of middle age agents to internalize the impact of their fertility decisions on old-age transfers under a public pension system. With homogeneous agents, a strong-enough negative aggregate shock to middle-age incomes destroys all family compacts, and in such a setting, an optimal public pension system cannot enter. This suggests the raison d'tre for social security must lie outside of its function as a pension system-specifically its redistributive function which emerges with heterogeneous agents. In a simple modification of our benchmark model-one that allows for idiosyncratic frictions to compact formation such as differences in infertility/mating status-a welfare-enhancing role for a public pension system emerges; such systems may flourish even when family compacts cannot.","[Barnett, Richard C.] Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, Sch Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bhattacharya, Joydeep] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Puhakka, Mikko] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, Oulu, Finland",Drexel University; Iowa State University; University of Oulu,"Bhattacharya, J (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",rclaybarnett@yahoo.com; joydeep@iastate.edu; mikko.puhakka@oulu.fi,,"Bhattacharya, Joydeep/0000-0002-3148-4592",Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; OKO Bank Foundation,Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; OKO Bank Foundation,"Puhakka thanks the Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation and the OKO Bank Foundation for support.

We also investigate the impact of the market overnight return on the VaR forecasts, which has not yet been considered with the range in VaR estimation. Model estimation is performed using linear quantile regression. An empirical analysis is conducted on 18 market indices. In spite of the simplicity of the proposed methods, the empirical results show that they successfully capture the main features of the financial returns and are competitive with established benchmark methods. The empirical results also show that several of the proposed range based VaR models, utilizing both the intra-day range and the overnight returns, are able to outperform GARCH-based methods and CAViaR models.

First, does the level of employee stock ownership impact the likelihood of dismissing poorly performing chief executive officers (CEOs)? Second, does the level of employee stock ownership affect the likelihood of appointing an outsider or an insider after the dismissal of an incumbent CEO? We suggest that employee stock ownership reinforces the firm performance-CEO dismissal link because employee shareholders' welfare consisting of fixed claims (wages, bonuses, etc.), residual claims (dividends, increase in stock value, etc.), and human capital (generic and idiosyncratic) are highly linked to their firm performance. Moreover, under conditions of poor performance, employee shareholders are likely to favor an outsider CEO because he or she is more likely to initiate and implement drastic changes to the strategy of the firm, and therefore, he or she is more likely to improve firm performance. Drawing on a longitudinal sample of French firms, we find that employee stock ownership strengthens the negative relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal likelihood. We find also that the higher employee ownership, the more likely that the underperforming CEO is replaced by an outsider. In contrast, employee ownership has no moderating impact on the likelihood of insider CEO appointment.","[Hollandts, Xavier] KEDGE BS, Kedge Business Sch & Alter Governance Chair CRCGM, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France",,"Hollandts, X (通讯作者)，KEDGE BS, Kedge Business Sch & Alter Governance Chair CRCGM, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.",xavier.hollandts@online.fr,,,,,,,55,2,2,2,21,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

We investigate whether monopolist-patentees and their prospective rivals are using the PTAB which has not previously received antitrust attention as a platform for striking settlements that delay the rivals' entry. Such settlements are common in pharmaceutical markets, and are typically antitrust violations in cases where the patentee pays the challenger (pay for delay). However, problematic statutory inducements lead to excessively-delayed competition even in lieu of such payments. Our empirical findings suggest that delayed entry settlements are now commonly executed in the PTAB, and that they comprise a large majority of all PTAB settlements reached between pharmaceutical rivals. Further, nearly half of the delayed entry settlements were reached after the relevant patent claims were deemed reasonably likely to be invalid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the bidding the envelope mechanism the government specifies what it is willing to spend and firms bid quantities (the highest winning). With uncertainty about project costs and benefits, the much less frequently applied bidding the envelope mechanism can lead to higher value for money.

Moreover, incarceration and other forms of criminal justice contact ranging from police stops to community supervision are disproportionately concentrated among African American and Latino men. Mass incarceration, and other ways in which the criminal justice system infiltrates the lives of families, has critical implications for inequality. Differential rates of incarceration damage the social and emotional development of children whose parents are in custody or under community supervision. The removal through incarceration of a large segment of earners reinforces existing income and wealth disparities. Patterns of incarceration and felony convictions have devastating effects on the level of voting, political engagement, and overall trust in the legal system within communities. Incarceration also has damaging effects on the health of families and communities. In short, the costs of mass incarceration are not simply collateral consequences for individuals but are borne collectively, most notably by African Americans living in acutely disadvantaged communities that experience high levels of policing and surveillance. In this article, we review racial and ethnic differences in exposure to the criminal justice system and its collective consequences.","[Pettit, Becky] Univ Texas Austin, Liberal Arts Sociol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gutierrez, Carmen] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Pettit, B (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Liberal Arts Sociol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bpettit@utexas.edu; carmen.gutierrez@utexas.edu,"Gutierrez, Carmen/HMO-7139-2023","Gutierrez, Carmen/0000-0001-9256-4468",Population Research Center [P2CHD042849],Population Research Center,"This research was supported by grant P2CHD042849, Population Research Center, awarded to the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Aim: This article proposes a relative dynamic two-stage network data envelopment analysis model for measurement of bank efficiency based on the slack-based measure. Setting: Twenty-seven banks in Ghana during the period of 2009-2014. Methods: By considering simultaneous processes within the framework of two-stage data envelopment analysis, the slack-based measure approach identifies the sources of inefficiency in the banks. Results: In the empirical analysis, non-performing loans are an undesirable output in one production process, which should also be treated as a carry-over factor; that is to say, some non-performing loans from the preceding year can be collected in the current year. The carry-over factors should be used to indicate the presence of performance gaps that exist in the banks. The proposed model was used to measure the efficiency of the 27 banks in Ghana during the period of 2009-2014. We also present useful suggestions for improvement in bank efficiency based on the empirical results. Conclusion: The 27 main commercial banks in Ghana are far from efficient. For all banks, the efficiency score in the second stage is much higher than that of the first stage. That means more attention should be paid to the first stage of production in order to increase the banks' efficiency.","[Zhou, Zhixiang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Econ, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Amowine, Nelson] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Dechun] Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Dept Econ & Int Trade, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Hohai University; Hohai University,"Amowine, N (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",amowinenelson@yahoo.com,"amowine, nelson/HSI-3530-2023","Amowine, Nelson/0000-0001-8840-8737","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701059, 71771126, 71301080]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71701059, 71771126, 71301080).",,62,7,7,2,22,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We also introduce a new real-time Korean GDP dataset, which is the focus of our experiments. The methodology that we utilize involves first estimating common latent factors (i.e., diffusion indices) from 190 monthly macroeconomic and financial series using various estimation strategies. These factors are then included, along with standard variables measured at multiple different frequencies, in various factor-MIDAS prediction models. Our key empirical findings as follows. (i) When using real-time data, factor-MIDAS prediction models outperform various linear benchmark models. Interestingly, the MSFE-best MIDAS models contain no autoregressive (AR) lag terms when backcasting and nowcasting. AR terms only begin to play a role in true forecasting contexts. (ii) Models that utilize only one or two factors are MSFE-best at all forecasting horizons, but not at any backcasting and nowcasting horizons. In these latter contexts, much more heavily parametrized models with many factors are preferred. (iii) Real-time data are crucial for forecasting Korean gross domestic product, and the use of first available versus most recent data strongly affects model selection and performance. (iv) Recursively estimated models are almost always MSFE-best, and models estimated using autoregressive interpolation dominate those estimated using other interpolation methods. (v) Factors estimated using recursive principal component estimation methods have more predictive content than those estimated using a variety of other (more sophisticated) approaches. This result is particularly prevalent for our MSFE-best factor-MIDAS models, across virtually all forecast horizons, estimation schemes, and data vintages that are analyzed.","[Kim, Hyun Hak] Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Swanson, Norman R.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Kookmin University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Kim, HH (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.",hyunhak.kim@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Kim, Hyun Hak/0000-0002-4909-500X",,,,,44,16,16,2,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

These include (i) freight vehicle downsizing and (ii) the dieselisation of van fleets (formally referred to as light commercial vehicles or LCVs). More recently, a new possible trend has started to emerge, mainly related to alternative fuelled LCVs for reducing air pollution emissions in urban areas. Electric LCVs up to 3.5 tons are considered a suitable option for last mile operations, yet only a few last mile operators are replacing their diesel fleets with electric vans. In order to probe electric LCV acceptance in the freight transport sector, we conducted 15 experiment-oriented interviews with urban freight transport and service operators who tested and adopted electric vans, exploring technical and operational obstacles in daily operations in Paris and London. Additional interviews (8) have been conducted with policymakers, to update the initial survey. The results show that, in addition to range concerns issues, last mile operators' perception and acceptance of electric vans are affected by other concerns, such as queue, payload and grid anxieties. A number of financial and non-financial incentives to foster the adoption of electric vans are identified and compared by considering the cities of Paris and London. The research also explored potential policy tools for mitigating the detected barriers.","[Morganti, Eleonora] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Browne, Michael] Univ Gothenburg, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Leeds; University of Gothenburg,"Morganti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.e.morganti@leeds.ac.uk,"Morganti, Eleonora/HKE-6997-2023; Browne, Michael/R-3596-2016","Browne, Michael/0000-0003-1900-5189; Morganti, Eleonora/0000-0002-3098-0789",Volvo Research and Educational Foundations; TEN-T Corri-Door project [2013-EU-92055-S],Volvo Research and Educational Foundations; TEN-T Corri-Door project,"We would like to thank the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations and the TEN-T Corri-Door project (2013-EU-92055-S) for the support in this study.

Propensity score, one-to-one matching models are employed to draw units from the control group, which are counties/cities that do not have a state-supported Amtrak station, to match with units from the treatment group, which are counties/cities that do. Using regression analysis, we find that state-support Amtrak stations have significant effect on local population in the long term, and the effect increases with time. However, the effect on civilian employment is almost non-existent. This suggests that state-supported Amtrak services can provide quality rail mobility and accessibility, which attract people to live in a rail-accessible region.

Literature suggests that companies use corporate social responsibility (CSR) to disguise corporate misconduct. Aim and Setting: This study examines one type of corporate misconduct, namely, earnings management (EM). Prior studies have found significant associations between CSR performance and EM; however, none of these studies controlled for CSR disclosure. This study unbundles the effects of CSR performance and CSR disclosure on EM. To examine the relationship between CSR performance and CSR disclosures and EM of listed South African companies. Methods: A company included on the Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) index is used as an indicator of CSR performance. Four measures of CSR disclosure are used. Results and conclusion: The study tests both CSR performance and CSR disclosure against both real earnings management (REM) and accrual-based earnings management (AEM). CSR performance and earnings management: Companies with better CSR performance were more likely to engage in EM through income increasing discretionary accruals. This suggests that managers who inflate earnings may engage in CSR activities to avoid unwanted scrutiny from stakeholders. Companies with better CSR performance were less likely to engage in REM, suggesting that managers with better CSR performance regard the management of earnings through accruals that reverse in the next period less incriminating than managing earnings through actual company resources. CSR disclosure and earnings management: Companies that integrated their CSR disclosures more into their annual report engaged less in income decreasing discretionary accruals, suggesting that managers with incentives to make more CSR disclosures to reduce information asymmetry will also be less inclined to manage earnings.","[Jordaan, Lauren A.] Univ South Africa, Coll Accounting Sci, Dept Financial Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa; [de Klerk, Marna; de Villiers, Charl J.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa; [de Villiers, Charl J.] Univ Auckland, Fac Business & Econ, Grad Sch Management, Auckland, New Zealand",University of South Africa; University of Pretoria; University of Auckland,"Jordaan, LA (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Coll Accounting Sci, Dept Financial Accounting, Pretoria, South Africa.",jordala@unisa.ac.za,"de Villiers, Charl/G-1334-2019","de Villiers, Charl/0000-0002-0715-8957",,,,,62,38,41,2,42,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Setting: This article examines 150 indigenous oil and gas SMEs in the upstream subsector of the Nigerian petroleum sector through a survey, using a questionnaire, conducted in 2015. Methods: The study applied the structural equation modelling (SEM) method. This method is used to test the relationships between the factors and to calculate the measurement errors in the hypotheses formulated. Results: The results show that technology scouting, vertical technology collaboration (VTC) and horizontal technology collaboration (HTC) positively and significantly contribute to inbound open innovation, which are thus significant in influencing the financial performance of SMEs. The size of technical staff and research and development (R&D) fund allocations also have a positive and significant correlation with the SMEs' financial performance. Meanwhile, the age of SMEs is negative and not significant in influencing financial performance. Conclusion: The results suggest that inbound open innovation through scouting, HTC and VTC should therefore be encouraged among SMEs to boost their internal capabilities, which have hitherto enhanced their financial performance. The management members of each SME should continually consider collaboration with the external actors because they cannot singularly possess all the innovative skills required in the industry. Also, each firm should commit itself to allocate more funds to R&D and at the same time should hire those who have relevant production skills and train the existing ones in their firms.","[Akinwale, Yusuf O.] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Akinwale, YO (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",yemiiakinwale@yahoo.com,"Akinwale, Yusuf/AAG-3670-2019","Akinwale, Yusuf/0000-0003-3955-2606",,,,,60,11,14,7,50,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It shows the locations' patenting activities in different technologies, centered around the core classes of electricity and aerodynamics. These activities shape the locations' positions in the global patent network and indicate their relative importance to the industry's innovations. We note that the network and thus the relative positions of the locations within it are constantly changing. We examine how the existing patented knowledge stock at a location affects its position in this technological network.

The NCAA has established a number of prominent athletic programs and achieved huge commercial success. In spite of this success, the NCAA has limited the compensation of student-athletes through collusive monopsonistic restraints. Ordinarily, these restraints would be vulnerable to antitrust attack, but the NCAA has enjoyed benign neglect by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The root of this is the Board of Regents [National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85 (1984)] decision, which requires rule-of-reason treatment of the NCAA's restraints. The essential role of amateurism of student athletes is used to justify the NCAA's cartel behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate that amateurism is a myth. We suggest that the NCAA will be unable to provide an evidentiary foundation for its claim that amateurism is crucial to the success of college athletic programs. In addition, we reject the possibility of an efficiency defense for the NCAA's cartel behavior.","[Blair, Roger D.] Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Blair, Roger D.] Univ Florida, Levin Coll Law, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wang, Wenche] Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Sport Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Wang, WC (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Sport Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",wwenche@umich.edu,,,,,,,28,4,8,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We show that optimal incentive pay should then be approximately concave in performance, the approximation being closer the more downside risk averse the principal is compared with the agent. Limiting the agent's liability would improve the approximation, but taxing the principal would make it coarser. The notion of an approximately concave function we introduce here to describe optimal contracts is relatively recent in mathematics; it is intuitive and translates into concrete empirical implications, notably for the composition of incentive pay packages. We also clarify which measure of prudence-among the various ones proposed in the literature-is relevant to investigate the tradeoff between downside risk sharing and incentives.","[Sinclair-Desgagne, Bernard] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Spaeter, Sandrine] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Sinclair-Desgagné, B (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",Bernard.sinclair-desgagne@hec.ca,,,project CSES of the Initiative of Excellence (IDEX) at the University of Strasbourg,project CSES of the Initiative of Excellence (IDEX) at the University of Strasbourg,"We thank Claude d'Aspremont, Pierre Chaigneau, Bruno Deffains, Dominique Demougin, Fre de ric Deroi an, Dominique Henriet, Rene Kirkegaard, Bertrand Koebel, Henri Louberge , David Martimort, Fre de ric Robert- Nicoud, Harris Schlesinger, and Marie-Claire Villeval for their valuable remarks and suggestions.

Unlike previous studies that do not consider structural changes, our study is the first one that shows how structural changes asymmetrically influence long-term stock returns depending on the high or low P/E period. This implies that structural changes in the market P/E ratio play an important role in explaining long-term stock returns.

These aspects have encouraged us to carry out our research, which we present in part. The main objective of the contribution was to examine and evaluate the relationship between the diversification of banks' assets and their effectiveness in the reference period 2008-2015, quantified by the non-parametric DEA method, in order to find out how the structure of assets impacts on the efficiency of individual banks. We used panel regression to process data. When compiling the model, we primarily looked at asset items through which the banking sectors diversified their portfolios. The results of analyses have highlighted important determinants of the efficiency of the banking sector. We quantified the impact of changes in the structure of assets of individual banks to increase their effectiveness.

Knowledge of the wage distribution and its comparison from various socio-economic and time-spatial aspects is a precondition for the assessment of living standards, social security and equality in the division of material values produced by the society. Statistical analysis of the wage distribution also forms the basis for government social policy, taxation, budgetary and other decisions. Moreover, the direct connection between wages and the purchasing power of the population brings tracking the level, structure and development of the wage distribution to the foreground when identifying sales opportunities for the products of both long- and short-term consumption. The present paper deals with a comparison of wage levels of fourteen regions in the Czech Republic. Similar wage-level clusters were created using the methods of cluster analysis. Three regions with the highest and lowest wage levels, respectively, were selected. For these six regions, the model wage distribution was presented to enable the comparison of wage development over the past seven years. Three-parameter lognormal curves represent the basis of the theoretical wage distribution.","[Bilkova, Diana] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Sq W Churchill 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Bilkova, Diana] Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Studies, Dept Informat & Math, Estonian St 500-3, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Bílková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Sq W Churchill 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.;Bílková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Studies, Dept Informat & Math, Estonian St 500-3, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",bilkova@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,"Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic [IP400040]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic","This paper was subsidized by the funds of institutional support of a long-term conceptual advancement of science and research number IP400040 at the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic.",,12,0,0,0,3,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,22,43,,,,,,22,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000003,0

It was determined, for example, that in the entire period under analysis, preference was given to the appointment of a new CEO (997) rather than to an extension of the term of office of the existing CEO (850). However, in the last three years a reversed trend can be observed (213/258).

However, they were much less likely to believe that product quality is mostly determined by external appearance, and they were more likely to refer to product features connected with environmental impact and product information. The respondents expressed opinions that workers producing high-quality products should not receive higher salaries, and that enterprises producing high-quality goods should provide their staff with a safe and clean working environment, and also respect human rights. Finally, the production process itself should not damage the natural environment.

In majority of economies, enterprises that dominate in the agricultural, forestry and fishing sector are micro, small and medium-sized. Financial reporting on biological assets is prescribed by relevant accounting standards. In this paper, the focus is on three accounting standards specially designed for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that deal with accounting treatment of biological assets. Biological assets need to be measured at fair value model and when fair value is not readily determinable without undue cost or effort, enterprises should use cost model. The main purpose of this paper includes exploring the extent to which Croatian small enterprises apply fair value in the field of financial reporting of agricultural, forestry and fishing activity and whether there are differences in the intensity of applying fair value to the cost model depending on the type of biological assets. The research results indicate that small agricultural, forestry and fishing enterprises in Croatia, which classify their resources as biological assets, are more prone to use cost method compared to fair value measurement approach. By comparing statistics for the cost and fair measurement method, it can be noticed that the measurement method does not affect total assets value of analysed small agricultural, forestry and fishing enterprises in Croatia. That result raises the question about the usefulness of using fair value measurement by smaller enterprises.","[Decman, Nikolina; Jezovita, Ana; Halar, Petra] Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Decman, N (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",ndecman@efzg.hr; ajezovita@efzg.hr; phalar@efzg.hr,"Dečman, Nikolina/P-9200-2019; Jezovita, Ana/O-3749-2019; Halar, Petra/H-9126-2018","Dečman, Nikolina/0000-0001-5167-4070; Jezovita, Ana/0000-0002-1740-6862; Halar, Petra/0000-0002-1129-699X",University of Zagreb,University of Zagreb,"This paper is the result of a project called ,,Current State and Perspectives of Using the Fair Value Measurement in Financial Reporting of Small Enterprises which was financed by the University of Zagreb as short-term research support for 2018.",,15,0,0,2,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,1108,1125,,,,,,18,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553202016,0

The authors assume that the growth path of the number of employees is equal to the product of population growth paths and the economic activity coefficient understood as the ratio of the number of employees to the size of the population. Taking into account the increase in the number of employees from the size of the population, the authors introduce the issues of demographic processes to the model Such a modification means that the growth path of the number of employees increases asymptotically to a fixed value (resulting from the forecast) and not to infinity, as it is the case in the Solow model In the empirical part they calibrate the parameters of the obtained model and carry out numerical simulations for the Polish economy in the period 2000-2050. In the simulation they use demographic forecasts for the Polish economy up to 2050, which shows that the population in Poland fell from 38,26 million people in 2000 to 33,95 million people in 2050. It turns out that the decline in population size does not have to have a negative impact on both the number of employees and economic growth. The Polish economy in 2000 was characterized by one of the lowest economic activity rates (tau = 0.38) among EU economies. Therefore, the study considers two scenarios for shaping the economic activity coefficient for the Polish economy: realistic when tau in the period 2000-2050 increases from 0.38 to 0.5. The adoption of tau = 0.5 in 2050 is due to Poland's average level, which characterized the economies with the highest level of this indicator among EU economies in 2016, namely: British, Dutch, German and Swedish. In the second scenario it was optimistic that the increase in tau will be 50% higher than in the first variant and in 2050 it will reach the level of 0.56.","[Dykas, Pawel] Jagiellonian Univ Cracow, Fac Management & Social Commun, Dept Math Econ, Ul Prof Stanislawa Lojasiewicza 4, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland; [Mentel, Grzegorz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Quantitat Methods, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland; [Misiak, Tomasz] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Econ, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Jagiellonian University; Rzeszow University of Technology; Rzeszow University of Technology,"Dykas, P (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ Cracow, Fac Management & Social Commun, Dept Math Econ, Ul Prof Stanislawa Lojasiewicza 4, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland.",pawel.dykas@uj.edu.pl; gmentel@prz.edu.pl; tmisiak@prz.edu.pl,"Mentel, Grzegorz/T-1850-2018; Misiak, Tomasz/T-7204-2019","Mentel, Grzegorz/0000-0002-6371-1219; Misiak, Tomasz/0000-0002-4296-0291",NCN [OPUS8 UMO-2014/15/B/HS4/04264],NCN,"This study was conducted as part of a NCN project entitled, Growth Cycles - Dynamic Business Models and Growth No. OPUS8 UMO-2014/15/B/HS4/04264.",,29,4,5,1,8,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The current research aims to investigate whether future accountant understands and implements code of conduct in the ethical dilemma situation of accounting professional works. Using purposive sampling, data was collected by survey method. Totally, 572 undergraduate accounting students from six universities, located in three provinces of Indonesia have participated in answering a closed-ended questionnaire. The result of statistical test using Pair-T test has provided empirical evidence that future accountants have a high level of ethical knowledge, that indicate their well understanding of code of conduct in accounting profession. However, their ability to implement ethical knowledge to solve problem in ethical dilemma situation is only in moderate level. This empirical finding indicates that a gap exists in ethical development process, thus ethical knowledge does not develop to ethical behavior.

Based on the theory of the psychological contract and the transitional concept, we have examined the causes of inconsistencies in mutual expectations of both employees and employers, leading to mistrust, uncertainty and erosion in labour relations. The empirical data obtained in 2015-2017 from the survey of workers in different sectors of the economy allow us to define various forms of violations of the psychological contract, to make a comparative analysis of the trends in the studied countries, to identify similarities and differences.

To increase its market share, most of parcel delivery service companies construct their delivery network as a form of hub-spoke network which is known to be efficient to deliver large scale products through widely spread area. In hub-spoke network, the number of hubs and their locations are important decision issues. Even though there are many researches on the hub-spoke network design, there is a lack of researches which deal with the fluctuating customer demand. Moreover, all the previous researches considering the fluctuating customer demand assumed that the capacity of hub facility is unlimited. Therefore, this research aims to propose the restructuring procedure of the parcel delivery network by considering the fluctuating customer demand with the capacitated hub facilities. In this research, utilization of temporary hubs is proposed so as to satisfy the fluctuating customer demand. Temporary hub responds to the excessive demands assigned to the permanent hubs and it is closed during the recession period to reduce its operating cost. A nonlinear integer programming model is constructed to decide the number of temporary hubs and their location at each time period. Since the complexity of the constructed mathematical model is NP-hard, GRASP based heuristic solution procedure is proposed. To evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed algorithm, experimental test with various demand sets considering four design factors are performed and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing meta-heuristic algorithm. Test results show that the algorithm proposed in this research is more robust than the existing algorithm against the fluctuation of customer demand as well as it provides overall better results.","[Jin, Hyun-Woong] Hannam Univ, Dept Business Adm, Daejeon, South Korea",Hannam University,"Jin, HW (通讯作者)，Hannam Univ, Dept Business Adm, Daejeon, South Korea.",jin@hannam.ac.kr,,"Jin, Hyun/0000-0001-8787-8454",Jungseok Logistics Foundation,Jungseok Logistics Foundation,This work was supported by Jungseok Logistics Foundation Grant.,,19,1,1,2,12,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

For example, in 2000 the percentage of older individuals aged 65+ years reached 12.4% worldwide. In 2030, this number should rise to 19% and in 2050 to 22%. Therefore, there is a need to prolong an active life of older people, especially by implementing non-pharmacological approaches. Current technological devices and services can assist them in this process. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the use of the Internet among older people in the Czech Republic with respect to their age. The key methods exploited in this study include a questionnaire survey, statistical processing of data collection, as well as evaluation of both empirical and theoretical findings on the research issue. The results indicate that the age is a decisive factor in the use of the Internet by seniors. In fact, the use of the Internet falls with the declining age with the breakthrough age 75+years. Generally, older people use the Internet for communication purposes with the help of e-mail, the most frequent ICT tool for this generation group. Nevertheless, the findings of this study show that the second most common reason for the use of the Internet is the Internet banking, followed by Skype communication and photo sharing. The results also suggest that older people should be trained in the use of the Internet since the training may help them overcome both psychological and social barriers, which represent the constraints in their use of the Internet. Furthermore, seniors could be divided into three basic age groups according to their special needs, which should be considered when designing new technological devices or services for these aging population groups, which could help them to enhance cognitive functions.","[Klimova, Blanka; Poulova, Petra; Prazak, Pavel] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Simonova, Ivana] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Educ, Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Cierniak-Emerych, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Engn & Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Klimová, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",blanka.klimova@uhk.cz; petra.poulova@uhk.cz; ivana.simonova@ujep.cz; pavel.prazak@uhk.cz; anna.cierniak-emerych@ue.wroc.pl,"Prazak, Pavel/F-8299-2013; Poulova, Petra/T-8640-2017; Klimova, Blanka/F-7016-2019; Simonova, Ivana/M-6456-2017","Prazak, Pavel/0000-0001-9160-5758; Poulova, Petra/0000-0001-5269-4065; Klimova, Blanka/0000-0001-8000-9766; Simonova, Ivana/0000-0001-9797-0393","Faculty of Informatics and Management of the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [2203/2018]","Faculty of Informatics and Management of the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","The paper is supported by the project Excellence (2203/2018) at the Faculty of Informatics and Management of the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",,54,5,5,10,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The complexity of the ongoing social and economic processes and their interrelations with external factors, the variety of goals and tasks that enterprises are facing, make it necessary to define and develop a mechanism for forming an enterprise management strategy. In this paper, we propose to consider the formation of a strategy through capital structuring, which is an essential part of the development of a comprehensive enterprise management strategy. For the enterprise under consideration, the optimization task of forming an enterprise management strategy based on the functional of minimizing the structural reorganization of enterprises has been developed, the effect of which is aimed at reducing the enterprise's assets to the extent that it is underutilized or not effectively used, that is, at maintaining its production potential to the maximum possible extent and at choosing a new direction for its activity. That said, the limitations of the optimization problem are the conditions for obtaining such a ratio of sources of funds and their use which ensures a satisfactory balance structure and the required level of the company's solvency. Practical implementation of this task for the company in question both by linear programming method and graphically in various directions of enterprise restructuring has shown that a satisfactory balance sheet structure and financial sustainability indicators can be achieved. It is shown that in order to implement the obtained strategies, it is necessary to select separate organizational, technical and managerial measures or a set of such measures. As a promising direction of scientific research in this field, it is proposed to form a strategy by solving the problem of multi-criteria optimization of the structure of the enterprise's capital.","[Mednikov, Mikhail Dmitrievich; Sokolitsyna, Natalya Alexandrovna; Yuryev, Vladimir Nikolaevich] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Inst Ind Management Econ & Trade, Grad Sch Business & Management, St Petersburg, Russia; [Sokolitsyn, Alexander Sergeevich; Ivanov, Maxim Vladimirovich] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Inst Ind Management Econ & Trade, Grad Sch Ind Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,"Mednikov, MD (通讯作者)，Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Inst Ind Management Econ & Trade, Grad Sch Business & Management, St Petersburg, Russia.",m_mednikov@mail.ru; alex.sokol1951@yandex.ru; ivanov_fuit@rambler.ru; natasokoli@yandex.ru; yurev@fem.spbstu.ru,"Ivanov, Maksim Vladimirovich/T-5771-2017; Sokolitsyna, Natalya/A-7517-2017; Sokolitsyn, Alexander/A-6074-2017","Sokolitsyna, Natalya/0000-0003-3322-5911; Sokolitsyn, Alexander/0000-0002-8640-1678",,,,,42,2,2,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,6600,6613,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2TA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000508553207057,0

However, the causes and determinants of this growth have not been identified so far. Therefore, we construct an export price index that adjusts for changes in non-price factors based on Benkovskis and Worz (2012). In addition to the index, we analyse determinants of non-price competitiveness in 13 new EU member states between 2006-2016.

Any changes occurring in this network may generate shocks that either are not very visible at the macroeconomic level, but can greatly affect this level, or microeconomic shocks may occur with the spread across the entire economic chain. In recent years, bank accidents have led to a significant disruption to the financial system around the world. Including the 2008 economic crisis has demonstrated that we need to better understand financing networks and systemic risk. The complexity of current financial systems around the world makes it difficult to create indicators that accurately assess the systemic risk of any institution. One of the most important issues that have been highlighted in recent years has been the interconnection of banks in the financial network. This leads to an increase in the likelihood of contagion, a scenario where small shocks, which initially only affected a party of institutions in the system, spread across the network. In a globalizing context, financial contagion is a phenomenon of topicality characterized by the virulence and rapidity with which financial crises are transmitted from one economy to another in a more interconnected world.

The tracking of real estate prices has become very important, especially after the outbreak of the economic crisis, as one of the main reasons was the disproportionate rise in real estate prices in the US. This has led to the emergence of a real estate bubble and turbulence in the global financial markets. Understanding real estate prices is very important in analyzing macroeconomic indicators.

While the relationship value was explored in terms of defining and composition of this value, there is little research measuring the relationship value and investigating the associations between relationship value development and time.Purpose. The aim of the paper is to propose a conceptual framework concerning the path of the relationship value development over time.Design/methodology. The aim has been achieved through answering the following research questions supported with extensive literature studies: a) what is time in business relationships, b) how to define and measure the relationship value, c) how does the relationship value change over time? Findings. 1) the relationship value is the balance between the value received from the exchange partner and the value provided by the enterprise; 2) the relationship value might be considered in the perspective of the past as an obtained value, in the perspective of the future as an expected value; 3) time might be considered from both points of view as an ongoing clock-time and an event time; 4) relationships are always dynamic and they don't follow a predetermined pattern of a life cycle, instead following indeterminate paths from one ``state'' to another; 5) the path of the relationship value development shows the evolution of the course and changes to the relationship value in the perspectives of both clock time and event time.Implications. The proposed measurement method of the relationship value could be used by managers to decide what relationships and with whom to shape them in the present and future.","[Piwoni-Krzeszowska, Estera] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Piwoni-Krzeszowska, E (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",estera.piwoni-krzeszowska@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-1-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,3150,3159,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7SQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525490800027,0

The proximity between a firm and its knowledge source is often seen as an important contributor to the firm's innovativeness, but proximity is multidimensional and involves much more than mere geographical proximity, particularly in the internet era. This paper examines the direct and indirect effects of multidimensional proximity between firms and universities/research institutes on firm innovativeness in a weak National Innovation System (NIS) country by considering knowledge interaction as a mediating variable. In order to test the hypotheses, structural equation modelling is performed on data collected from innovative firms in Thailand. The results indicate that the organizational proximity and technological proximity between firms and their university/research institute partners play an indirect role in enhancing the innovativeness of firms through knowledge interactions.

However, age category of farms' managers between 45 and 59 years prevails in the Czech Republic. There are certain barriers in the sector that hinder the transfer of farms from older generation to younger. Those are of the administrative and legal character as well as given by personal features and motivation of young persons. There are problems also with the availability of production factors - mainly agricultural land for sale or long-term lease and investment capital as young starting farmers have difficult access to credit due to short history. The aim of the paper is to examine the motivation of young people to enter the agricultural sector and to become a self-employed farmer and to assess the barriers that makes the entrance to agriculture harder than to other sectors. Certain recommendations how to overcome the obstacles related to the initiation of agricultural activities are outlined. Literature review and discussion with experts revealed that main issue is the access to land and credits. Those barriers are almost insurmountable for complete new entrants. Hence, it is easier to foster generation renewal when the agricultural holding is transferred between generations.","[Simpachova Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Simpachová Pechrová, M (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic.",Simpachova.Marie@uzei.cz,,,internal research grant IVP of the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information [1113/2017],internal research grant IVP of the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information,The paper was financed from the internal research grant IVP no. 1113/2017 of the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Information.,,11,0,0,1,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2238-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,454,461,,,,,,8,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BO2QE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507522000043,0

The purpose of this article is to contribute to economic geography research on path creation by developing a conceptual framework that specifies key conditions and reinforcing mechanisms for path creation, on the one hand, and barriers to the materialization of such conditions and mechanisms, on the other hand. As such, the framework moves beyond firm-centric perspectives and argues that path creation needs to be understood as a collective endeavor incorporating both firm and nonfirm actors. By implication, this necessitates an understanding of the broader contexts that shape path creation processes, including how the dynamics of an emerging path are affected by the dynamics of established paths. The authors employ this framework to analyze Norway's offshore wind power (OWP) industry. Their analysis reveals that an initial enabling context for OWP path creation turned into more constrained conditions. Similar to findings from a number of other studies, they identify branching between related sectors as a primary path creation mechanism. However, they find that this mechanism is vulnerable to shifting contextual conditions, which for various reasons resulted in the studied emerging path losing resources and legitimacy, thus implying potential negative path interdependence. The authors also identify barriers to path creation in the institutional environment, particularly in terms of lack of policy coherence in support for key resource formation processes that are pivotal for path creation processes to generate sustained momentum.","[Steen, Markus] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Steen, Markus] SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Ind Management, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Hansen, Gard Hopsdal] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Sustainable Energy Studies, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Steen, M (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Steen, M (通讯作者)，SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Ind Management, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",markus.steen@ntnu.no; gard.hansen@ntnu.no,,"Steen, Markus/0000-0002-0956-2662",Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU); CenSES-Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies from Research Council of Norway [209697]; InNOWiC-Internationalization of Norwegian Offshore Wind Capabilities from the Research Council of Norway [255400],Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU); CenSES-Centre for Sustainable Energy Studies from Research Council of Norway; InNOWiC-Internationalization of Norwegian Offshore Wind Capabilities from the Research Council of Norway,"The authors would like to thank Asbjorn Karlsen, Arne Isaksen, Stuart Dawley, Danny MacKinnon, Robert Hassink, Michaela Trippl, Arild Aspelund, Tage Koed Madsen, and Knut Sorensen for helpful comments on earlier versions of the article.

A vast literature has described these strategies and has shown that this phenomenon is widespread and growing in most developed economies. However, very little systematic evidence of the extent or consequences of servitization based on a comprehensive data set of firms exists. In this paper, we provide such evidence using exhaustive data for French manufacturing firms between 1997 and 2007. We find that the vast majority of French manufacturers sell services in addition to producing goods. The shift toward services is growing steadily but at a slow pace. We also estimate the impact of servitization on firm performance. Controlling for various sources of endogeneity bias, our most conservative results show that firms that start selling services increase their profitability by 0.4%, their employment by 2.1%, and their total sales by 0.6%. For small businesses, we also find a positive impact on the production of goods. We also uncover strong heterogeneity across manufacturing industries.","[Crozet, Matthieu] Univ Paris Sud Paris Saclay, RITM, Paris, France; [Milet, Emmanuel] Univ Geneva, Geneva Sch Econ & Management, Geneva, Switzerland",Universite Paris Saclay; University of Geneva,"Crozet, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud Paris Saclay, RITM, Paris, France.",matthieu.crozet@gmail.com; emmanuel.milet@unige.ch,,,,,,,48,132,133,5,110,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Therefore, unilateral public intervention can be optimal: in case of rival governments' retaliation, under appropriate product competition degrees, welfares are larger than under free trade even for small managers' power. Thus, managerial delegation practices are crucial also for international trade issues.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Jagiellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Jagiellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,36,3,3,0,4,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

With the objective of forecasting the sum of the next observations, the concept of rolling season is adopted and a structure of rolling conditional distributions is formulated. The probabilistic properties, estimation and prediction procedures, and the forecasting performance of the model are studied and demonstrated with simulations and real examples.","[Chang, Kun; Chen, Rong] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat & Biostat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Fomby, Thomas B.] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Southern Methodist University,"Chen, R (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat & Biostat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",rongchen@stat.rutgers.edu,,,"NSF [DMS-1540863, DMS-1209085]; Department of Homeland Security [2009-ST-061-CCI002-05, 2009-ST-061-CCI002-06]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Homeland Security(United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)),"NSF, Grant/Award Number: DMS-1540863, DMS-1209085; Department of Homeland Security, Grant/Award Number: 2009-ST-061-CCI002-05 and 2009-ST-061-CCI002-06",,15,0,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

Evidence from a Natural Experiment,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CONTRACT LAW; USURY LAWS; FINANCE; CEILINGS; EQUITY; MARKET; LOANS; PRICE,"We use a natural experimentan unexpected judicial decisionto study how the enforceability of debt contracts affects consumer lending. In May 2015, a federal court unexpectedly held that the usury statutes of three statesConnecticut, New York, and Vermontapplied to certain loans that market participants had assumed were exempt from those statutes. The case introduced substantial uncertainty about whether borrowers affected by the decision were under any legal obligation to repay principal or interest on their loans. Using proprietary data from three marketplace-lending platforms, we use a difference-in-differences design to study the decision's effects. We find no evidence that borrowers defaulted strategically as a result of the decision. However, the decision reduced credit availability for higher-risk borrowers in affected states. Secondary-market data indicate that the price of notes backed by above-usury loans issued to borrowers in affected states declined, particularly when those borrowers were late on their payments.","[Honigsberg, Colleen] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jackson, Robert J., Jr.] US Secur & Exchange Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Squire, Richard] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Stanford University; U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC); Fordham University,"Honigsberg, C (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,41,6,7,1,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

These curves can be viewed as a time series of functions that can be observed on equally spaced and dense grids. Owing to the so-called curse of dimensionality, the nature of high-dimensional data poses challenges from a statistical perspective; however, it also provides opportunities to analyze a rich source of information, so that the dynamic changes of short time intervals can be better understood. In this paper, we consider forecasting a time series of functions and propose a number of statistical methods that can be used to forecast 1-day-ahead intraday stock returns. As we sequentially observe new data, we also consider the use of dynamic updating in updating point and interval forecasts for achieving improved accuracy. The forecasting methods were validated through an empirical study of 5-minute intraday S&P 500 index returns.","[Shang, Han Lin] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Stat, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Shang, HL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Stat, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",hanlin.shang@anu.edu.au,,"Shang, Han Lin/0000-0003-1769-6430","Research School Grant from the College of Business and Economics, Australian National University","Research School Grant from the College of Business and Economics, Australian National University","The author would like to thank a reviewer for insightful comments and suggestions.
