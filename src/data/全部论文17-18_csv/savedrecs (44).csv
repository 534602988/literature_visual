If so, how? A recent scientific paper suggests that as bears' food access worsens due to a changing climate, we should consider supplementary feeding. Feeding starving bears could meet ethical obligations to help wild animals suffering from climate change. But supplementary feeding may also cause harms, and lead to park-like management of some bear populations - a concern for those who care about the value of wildness.

The citizens' participation is of a key significance to the effective management of the territorial government units. It builds up the sense of local community and co-responsibility for the decisions taken. The aim of the public participation is both the creation of an efficient system needed for the citizens' needs meeting and obtaining the citizens' acceptance of the actions by the authorities as well as the citizens' trust in the efficiency of the authority's activity. Such activities trigger the citizens' identification with the specific community and have them more likely to engage in its vital issues. The aim of this paper is to present the tools of social participation in the modern and integrated management of the units of territorial government; one particular instrument, i.e. the social (participatory) budget. This paper presents among others the idea of participatory budgeting and the phases of its creating. It also includes the comparison of data concerning participatory budgeting in selected cities/states.

In such countries, challenges related to corruption combined with intensely competitive pressures from China and other countries appear to preclude possibilities for state leaders and bureaucracies to engineer industrial growth. Drawing upon an original survey of 229 apparel shop owners in Kyrgyzstan and dozens of interviews, this article analyzes the creation of a regional Eurasian production network in a country where we would least expect to see manufacturing dynamism. I adopt an everyday international political economy approach to the study of production networks in this country-considered to have a challenging business environment with high corruption-focusing on the ways in which shop owners and other intermediaries understand and relate to state bureaucrats at different nodes of the network. Doing so expands our understanding of the varieties of pathways to contemporary export-oriented production, including ones that emerge at the margins of the law.","[Spector, Regine A.] UMass Amherst, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Spector, RA (通讯作者)，UMass Amherst, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",,,,,,,,76,6,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Adipogenesis; the main contributor in marbling, consists of two stages: preadipocyte determination and adipocyte differentiation. Preadipocyte determination occurs even from growing stage, while adipocyte differentiation occurs in fattening stage of beef cattle. The effectiveness of nutritional and hormonal challenges to enhance adipogenesis is important to design a least-cost production. The influence of nutrition and hormone was found on adipogenesis in stromal vascular cells isolated from native Hanwoo beef cattle adipose tissue. In this study, high level of acetate, which is the most predominant volatile fatty acid produced in the rumen, was effectively increased preadipocyte determination in stromal vascular cells, while high level of propionate was observed to effectively support adipocyte differentiation. On the other hand, a high level of testosterone was observed to decrease adipogenesis. This study suggests that acetate is preferred in the growing stage and propionate in the fattening stage. Furthermore, low concentration of testosterone is favorable for the preadipocyte determination of progenitor cells as well as adipocyte differentiation.","[Wandita, Theresia Galuh; Bataar, Delgerzul; Joshi, Najuma; Hwang, Seong Gu] Dept Anim Life & Environm Sci, Anseong, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",,"Hwang, SG (通讯作者)，Dept Anim Life & Environm Sci, Anseong, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",sghwang@hknu.ac.kr,,,Korea Institute of Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning [012687-03],Korea Institute of Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST)),This work was financially supported by grants from Korea Institute of Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning (Project No. 012687-03).,,41,1,1,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,101,112,,,,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800021,0

Relying on the policy interdependence theory, this study argues that labour rights policy in a state is dependent on its economic competitors' labour policy decisions. It specifically maintains that the intensifying competition for foreign direct investment and exports as well as against imports channels negative externalities of deteriorating labour protection in competing states which drives expansive downward policy mimicking and leads to a global decline in labour rights - a race to the bottom. Utilising spatial econometric technique to analyse a new data on labour rights for the period 1994-2009, it finds that labour rights practices are interdependent among economic competitors and experience global deteriorations; whereas labour rights laws remain largely independent due to high policy and reputational costs of lowering them and show more fluctuations.","[Wang, Zhiyuan] Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Dept Polit Sci, Commerce, TX 75428 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Commerce,"Wang, ZY (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Dept Polit Sci, Commerce, TX 75428 USA.",Zhiyuan.Wang@tamuc.edu,,,,,,,102,10,11,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The public bicycle-sharing systems, which are usually spatially embedded where original urban bus transport networks are located, comprise the new urban public transport system together with the bus transport networks. Therefore, studying the impact of the public bicycle-sharing systems on the original urban public transport networks is an important research subject. In this study, using the real spatial location data of the public bicycle-sharing systems of Hangzhou and Ningbo in China, we propose a multi-layer coupling spatial network model that considers the geographical information on bus stations, bus routes, and public bicycle stations by studying the urban public transport networks. The spatial network model consists of bus subnets, short-distance bicycle subnets, and short-distance walk subnets which are interdependent rather than independent. We apply the model to study the influence of bicycling between the short-distance bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between the short-distance bus station pairs (SDW) on the performance of the urban public transport networks. Results show that SDB and SDW can significantly reduce the average transfer times, the average path length of passengers' trips and the Gini coefficient of an urban public transport network. Therefore, the public bicycle-sharing systems can decrease the average trip time of passengers and increase the efficiency of an urban public transport network, as well as effectively improve the uneven level of traffic flow spatial distribution of an urban public transport network and will be helpful to smoothening the traffic flow and alleviating traffic congestion.","[Yang, Xu-Hua; Cheng, Zhi; Ruan, Zhong-Yuan; Zheng, Yu-Jun] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xu-Hua] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55416 USA; [Chen, Guang] Taizhou Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei] Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Taizhou University; Beihang University,"Yang, XH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xhyang@zjut.edu.cn,"Zheng, Yu-Jun/K-8581-2012; zhongyuan, zhongyuan/L-7515-2019; Zheng, Yu/GRJ-5808-2022; Yang, Xuhua/H-2130-2012; Wang, Lei/O-2929-2017","Wang, Lei/0000-0002-7014-2149; Yang, Xu-Hua/0000-0001-9437-262X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773348, 61374152, 61473016, 11605154, 61473263]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61773348, 61374152, 61473016, 11605154 and 61473263.",,29,63,68,6,140,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

However, we found that quantile regression estimates allow identifying nonlinearities in the CBB's policy in periods with large shocks to the inflation rate, output, and exchange rate, as occurred in the exchange rate crisis in 2003 and in the economic crisis in 2008.","[de Medeiros, Gabriela Bezerra; da Silva Bejarano Aragon, Edilean Kleber] Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Dept Econ, Jardim Cidade Univ, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil; [de Medeiros, Gabriela Bezerra; da Silva Bejarano Aragon, Edilean Kleber] Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Grad Program Econ PPGE, Jardim Cidade Univ, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil; [Portugal, Marcelo Savino] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Econ, Ave Joao Pessoa,52 Sala 33B 3 Andar, BR-90040000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Portugal, Marcelo Savino] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Business Adm PPGE & PPGA, Ave Joao Pessoa,52 Sala 33B 3 Andar, BR-90040000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"de Medeiros, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Dept Econ, Jardim Cidade Univ, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil.;de Medeiros, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Paraiba UFPB, Grad Program Econ PPGE, Jardim Cidade Univ, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil.",gabriela.bm@hotmail.com; msp@ufrgs.com; edilean@hotmail.com,,"Savino Portugal, Marcelo/0000-0002-2132-013X",National the Brazilian Council of Science and Technology (CNPq),National the Brazilian Council of Science and Technology (CNPq),"The authors would like to thank the editor, two anonymous referees, and the participants of the 43 degrees Brazilian Economics Meeting for their helpful comments and suggestions.

This scheme started in 2005 and has now around 350 stations and 4500 bikes in operation, with more than 50,000 annual members. By the means of an Internet-based survey more than 3000 respondents were described by their detailed socio-demographic profile, their travel means and habits, a one-day activity-travel diary and additionally a seven days activity-travel diary filled by around 700 volunteers. By this way the survey covers all travel modes and day-to-day variations in travel behavior beyond the sole use of shared bike. We analyze with a discrete choice model the socio-demographic and spatial factors affecting the probability of being an annual member of the Velo'v scheme. Then we compare with descriptive statistics their daily travel behavior involving as well bike sharing as other traditional modes to the travel behavior of the general population as given with the latest Household Travel Survey available in the Lyon area (2015). The majority of Velo'v annual members are male, younger and hold higher social positions when compared with the Lyon's general population. An individual higher social position and the residential proximity to stations have both separate and positive effects on the probability of being an annual member of the service. Velo'v members are not captive from public transport, a majority of them have access to a car and they are fully multimodal in their day-to-day travel behavior. Velo'v bikes are used by them for any activity, not necessarily every day, like any other travel mode. The multimodal behavior of Velo'v members shows that Velo'v supply fits especially a demand not satisfied when the public transport station is too distant from home.","[Raux, Charles; Zoubir, Ayman; Geyik, Mirkan] Univ Lyon, CNRS, LAET, Lyon, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Raux, C (通讯作者)，ISH, LAET, 14 Av Berthelot, F-69007 Lyon, France.",charles.raux@laet.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr,,"Zoubir, Ayman/0000-0001-5047-4421",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-12-SOIN-0001]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-SOIN-0001] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work was supported by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Grant ANR-12-SOIN-0001].

In the first stage, the DNDEA based on a slack-based measure is used to evaluate the dynamic production efficiency, service efficiency and overall operational efficiency of 30 global airlines for the period from 2009 to 2012, which explores the linkages in operations among airlines' internal divisions as well as the dynamic operational performance, with consideration of carry-over activities. In the second stage, the impacts of alliances and size on the operational performance of airlines are explored by adopting a bootstrapped truncated regression model. The empirical results reveal the following: (1) the weight setting on importance of overall operational efficiency on a yearly basis has significant impact on the operational efficiency of airlines; (2) the overall operational efficiency shows a yearly declining trend; (3) joining an airline alliance, the airlines' total assets and the GDP have significant impacts on operational performance.","[Yu, Ming-Miin; Chen, Li-Hsueh; Chiang, Hui] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Transportat Sci, 2 Pei Ning Rd, Keelung 20224, Taiwan",National Taiwan Ocean University,"Chen, LH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Transportat Sci, 2 Pei Ning Rd, Keelung 20224, Taiwan.",yumm@mail.ntou.edu.tw; yoannachen@gmail.com; zooechiang@gmail.com,"sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015",,,,,,63,21,22,0,33,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

More specifically, formal institutions such as government size, protection of property rights, sound money, free trade, and regulation are examined to understand their impacts on firm creation. This study draws upon institutional theory and uses panel data (2001-2012) from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and Economic Freedom of the World index to test hypotheses with a sample of 37 developing and 28 developed countries.

We employ a theoretical framework that allows for multiple industries and a heterogeneous workforce. Capital and labor are the inputs in production and the different types of labor are combined in a multi-nest CES framework that builds on Borjas (2003) and Ottaviano and Peri (2012). The model is calibrated using data on the'characteristics of the workforce, including an indicator for imputed unauthorized status (Center for Migration Studies, 2014), and industry output from the BEA. Our results show that the economic contribution of unauthorized workers to the U.S. economy is substantial, at approximately 3.1% of GDP annually, which amounts to roughly $6 trillion over a 10-year period. These effects on production are smaller than the share of unauthorized workers in employment, which is close to 5%. The reason is that unauthorized workers are less skilled and appear to be less productive, on average, than natives and legal immigrants with the same observable skills. We also find that legalization of unauthorized workers would increase their contribution to 4.8% of private-sector GDP. The source of these gains stems from the productivity increase arising from the expanded labor market opportunities for these workers which, in turn, would lead to an increase in capital investment by employers.","[Edwards, Ryan; Ortega, Francesc] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Ortega, F (通讯作者)，CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",edwards.ryan.d@gmail.com; fortega@qc.cuny.edu,,"ortega, francesc/0000-0001-5779-5711",Center for American Progress (CAP),Center for American Progress (CAP),Edwards's work is directly supported by funds from the Center for American Progress (CAP).,,34,9,13,0,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The main numerical tool employed is the generalized singular value decomposition. This provides a numerical estimation procedure which can tackle efficiently the particular case when the variance-covariance matrix is singular. The proposed algorithm is further adapted to deal with the special case of the block-recursive SEM. The block diagonal structure of the variance-covariance matrix is exploited in order to reduce significantly the computational burden. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the computational efficiency of the new estimation strategy when compared with the equivalent method that ignores the block-recursive structure of the SEM.,"[Cosbuc, Mircea I.; Gatu, Cristian] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania; [Colubi, Ana] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain; [Kontoghiorghes, Erricos John] Cyprus Univ Technol, Limassol, Cyprus; [Kontoghiorghes, Erricos John] Birkbeck Univ London, London, England",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; University of Oviedo; Cyprus University of Technology; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Gatu, C (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",cgatu@info.uaic.ro,"kontoghiorghes, erricos/IQV-6350-2023; Gatu, Cristian/C-4814-2011","Kontoghiorghes, Erricos/0000-0001-9704-9510; Gatu, Cristian/0000-0002-7362-424X",Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research Project [PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0242]; COST Action [IC1408]; [GRUPIN14-005],Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research Project; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST));,"This work is in part supported by the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research Project PN-II-RU-TE-2011-3-0242, the COST Action IC1408 and the Project GRUPIN14-005.",,26,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Non-discriminating minority firms could then provide a refuge for other minority workers. In Becker's classic treatment of discrimination by firms he posits a variation of this idea. He suggests that if the number of jobs at non-discriminating firms is greater than the number of minority workers, then these minority workers will all find their way to and be employed by the non-discriminating firms. In this paper I employ simulations to examine the extent to which minority workers can successfully find employment at non-discriminating minority firms in the presence of labor market frictions. These simulations also demonstrate the importance of access to capital for minority entrepreneurs.","[Fain, James] Oklahoma State Univ, 429 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Fain, J (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, 429 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jim.fain@okstate.edu,,"Fain, James/0000-0001-7206-2890",,,,,22,0,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Given the difficulty in managing fiat money without information and data generated by the market, and the simple Soviet financial structure, the increasing debt suggests that non-performing financial assets accumulated in the household sector, and inefficient real assets built up in the enterprise sector. The empirical analysis using a small time-varying parameter vector autoregression model identified that funds supplied to the economy had contributed at a decreasing rate to economic growth during nearly the entire Soviet period. Funds continued to be used wastefully, non-performing financial assets accumulated, and consequently the value of the ruble was decreasing. In this sense, Soviet monetary management was inefficient. Future research will include efforts to investigate responsiveness of price regulating authorities to changes in monetary and financial situation, to understand monetary management on the republic level, and to quantify the efficiency of use of funds.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that the unemployment rate is biased and underestimates the true level of underemployment. Closing this gap is especially important because the distortion systematically changes along the business cycle and affects the various subgroups of the population differently. Neglecting these effects when setting up policies might flaw its effectiveness and result in unexpected outcomes. Although the existence of these effects is widely agreed upon only little is known about the magnitude of these effects across various subgroups. Using a highly disaggregated dataset from Germany, this study examines the dynamics in labor force participation that go beyond the unemployment rate. Ample evidence is found that the discouraged and the added worker effect significantly affect particular subgroups in the German labor market. In addition, the discouraged and the added worker effect are generally found to be very symmetric in economic upturns and downturns. Moreover, the labor market reforms in Germany between 2003 and 2005 are found to have reduced the discouraged worker effect on average by 25%, leaving the added worker effect unchanged.","[Provenzano, Sandro] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Provenzano, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.",sandro.provenzano@outlook.com,,"Provenzano, Sandro/0000-0003-0626-8801",,,,,27,1,1,1,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The objective of the current study is to examine a potential justification of this policy. We compare the propensity to pay local property tax among owner-occupiers and renters. The Israeli setting provides a unique example for the removal of renter's illusion. Unlike other countries, municipal property tax charge is registered and paid directly by renters. Consequently, this methodology provides a tractable measure for the degree of financial compliance in renter-occupied units. Micro-level panel data collected from the Jerusalem municipality covering 2012-2014, demonstrate that compared with free-market renters, owner-occupiers without partial exemptions paid 11.95% more of the current local property tax charge, a statistically significant difference. This gap remains robust even after adjustment to the same level of income, age, number of children, location (West vs. East Jerusalem), and the same annual lagged percentage of paid charge. Moreover, the highest gap of 10.63% is found among 20-year-old tenants. Finally, the estimated increase in tax collection associated with tenure mode shift is 0.01-0.77% of the total anticipated collections in 2015. Research findings thus demonstrate the utility of programs designed to motivate renters to become owner-occupiers, particularly among the youngest households without children.","[Arbel, Yuval; Fialkoff, Chaim; Kerner, Amichai] Netanya Acad Coll, Sch Real Estate, 1 Univ St, IL-4223587 Netanya, Israel",,"Arbel, Y (通讯作者)，Netanya Acad Coll, Sch Real Estate, 1 Univ St, IL-4223587 Netanya, Israel.",arbeyuva@netanya.ac.il; cfialk@gmail.com; kerneram@netvision.net.il,,"Arbel, Yuval/0000-0003-4365-6280",,,,,39,7,7,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We report an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study in order to investigate the finite-sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimator for the new class of models as well as its flexibility in explaining a misspecified dynamic spatial dependence process.

Regarding bilateral trade, we find that political conflict, measured by negative reports in Reuters' articles, seems to only affect bilateral trade between countries that are not both members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). For these countries, a 1 per cent rise in the tension score results in a 0.05 per cent decline in trade. There is weaker evidence that improvement in bilateral relationship, measured by positive reports in Reuters' articles, is associated with more trade. As for capital flows, while long-term capital flows, measured by foreign direct investment, appear to be unaffected by short-term tensions, both a non-democratic government and a history of war negatively affect FDI.","[Gawarkiewicz, Thomas] Cornerstone Res, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Tang, Yao] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Tang, Yao] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Dept Appl Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Cornerstone Research; Bowdoin College; Peking University,"Gawarkiewicz, T (通讯作者)，Cornerstone Res, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",,,,,,,,36,2,2,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1958,1988,,10.1111/twec.12478,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900011,0

Yet, few studies have considered the impact casinos have beyond the border of their host community or state. Using county-level data between 1994 and 2012, this paper examines the impact that casino legalization had on crime rates using a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) to account for spatial dependence. A difference-in-differences model suggests that in the long term commercial casinos are associated with no significant change in crime in their host county, but crimes in surrounding adjacent counties do significantly increase. Indian casinos in contrast are associated with long-term reductions in crime in their surrounding counties. However, a distributed lag model, used to detect year-to-year variation in crime, reveals that both commercial and Indian casinos are associated with increases in crime in the years immediately following their opening. For commercial casinos these increases were statistically significant in the host county for six years, whereas for Indian casinos a statistically significant increase occurred in the first two years after opening. Impacts on surrounding adjacent counties were also significant but generally for fewer years. These initial increases in crime were offset by significant decreases in crime many years later explaining the long-term pattern captured in the difference-indifferences model.","[Nichols, Mark W.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Mail Stop 0030, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Tosun, Mehmet Serkan] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Tosun, Mehmet Serkan] Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, IZA, Mail Stop 0030, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Nichols, MW (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Coll Business Adm, Mail Stop 0030, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",mnichols@unr.edu; tosun@unr.edu,,,,,,,33,12,12,2,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

It draws on the French case, where the state's explicit call for firms to address the work-family life balance issue, notably through mandatory collective bargaining, has provided opportunities for union mobilization. Findings from qualitative research conducted at branch and company levels show that this public strategy has failed to stimulate innovation in related union policy and practices, even within a relatively feminized and partnership-oriented confederation. The reasons for this failure are discussed using a theoretical framework combining opportunity structure, and voice and choice issues. The article concludes that union underinvestment in work-family life balance results from a lack of effectiveness of the opportunity structure, but also, more specifically, from voice and choice factors which lead union representatives to downplay the issues at stake in this new bargaining agenda.","[Brochard, Delphine; Letablier, Marie-Therese] Univ Paris 01, Maison Sci Econ,Bur 206,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Brochard, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Maison Sci Econ,Bur 206,106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",delphine.brochard@univ-paris1.fr,,"Brochard, Delphine/0000-0003-0740-6030",IRES (Institut de recherches economiques et sociales),IRES (Institut de recherches economiques et sociales),The field research upon which this article is based was supported by funding from IRES (Institut de recherches economiques et sociales) at the request of the CFDT.,,46,15,15,0,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We employ the FGV-IBRE Economic Tendency Survey, which consists of monthly qualitative information from approximately 2000 consumers since 2006, and also the Focus Survey of the Central Bank of Brazil, with daily forecasts since 1999 from roughly 250 professional forecasters. Natural candidates to win a forecast competition in the literature of surveys of expectations are the (consensus) cross-sectional average forecasts (AF). We first show that these forecasts are a bias-ridden version of the conditional expectation of inflation using the no-bias tests proposed in Issler and Lima (J Econom 152(2):153-164, 2009) and Gaglianone and Issler (Microfounded forecasting, 2015). The results reveal interesting data features: Consumers systematically overestimate inflation (by 2.01 p.p., on average), whereas market agents underestimate it (by 0.68 p.p. over the same sample). Next, we employ a pseudo out-of-sample analysis to evaluate different forecasting methods: the AR(1) model, the Granger and Ramanathan (J Forecast 3:197-204, 1984) forecast combination (GR) technique, a Phillips-curve based method, the Capistran and Timmermann (J Bus Econ Stat 27:428-440, 2009) combination method, the consensus forecast (AF), the bias-corrected average forecast (BCAF), and the extended BCAF. Results reveal that: (i) the MSE of the AR(1) model is higher compared to the GR (and usually lower compared to the AF); and (ii) the extended BCAF is more accurate than the BCAF, which, in turn, dominates the AF.

The vector autoregression result indicates that both S&P500 and MSCI China indeed have the greatest impact and significance on the other four stock markets. However, the tail dependence of Taiex and Kospi versus either S&P500 or MSCI China are lower due to unilateral impacts from US or China. The Clayton copula yields the jumps of tail dependence and the elliptical copulas generate the trends of tail dependence. The threshold tests of Clayton Kendall's taus between most stock markets are significant in both subprime and Greek debt crises while the tests of Student-t Kendall's taus are only significant for the subprime crisis. It appears that the subprime has changeable trend and jump states of contagion risk while Greek debt has one steady trend state and changeable jump states of contagion risk.","[Su, EnDer] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Su, E (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",suender@ccms.nkfust.edu.tw,"Su, EnDer/AAD-9141-2019",,,,,,43,7,8,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We first theorize EU great power politics. Based on theories of corporate action, the EU constitutes a strong market power in its own right and a weak security power. While it is institutionally ill-equipped to purposefully mobilize its market power to pursue high-politics goals, its communitarized external relations may inadvertently challenge important security interests of other great powers. Second, we show that the EU acted as an inadvertent great power vis-a-vis Russia in its Ukraine policy which was primarily driven by the supranational decision-making apparatus and low-politics considerations, but engendered a bipolar power struggle with Russia over Ukraine. The risks inherent in EU inadvertent great power politics are deeply engrained in the EU's institutional structure and therefore difficult to mitigate.","[Gehring, Thomas; Urbanski, Kevin] Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Oberthur, Sebastian] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Gehring, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",thomas.gehring@uni-bamberg.de,,"Urbanski, Kevin/0000-0003-0327-3031; Oberthur, Sebastian/0000-0001-8626-5082",,,,,65,24,27,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Following Bera et al. (2010), we introduce these adjusted gradient tests along with their standard counterparts within a generalized method of moments framework. These tests can be used to detect the presence of (i) the contemporaneous spatial lag terms, (ii) the time lag term, and (iii) the spatial time lag terms in a high order SDPD model. These adjusted tests have two advantages: (i) their null asymptotic distribution is a central chi-squared distribution irrespective of the mis-specified alternative model, and (ii) their test statistics are computationally simple and require only the ordinary least-squares estimates from a non-spatial two-way panel data model. We investigate the finite sample size and power properties of these tests through a Monte Carlo study. Our results indicates that the adjusted gradient tests have good finite sample properties. Finally, using an application from the empirical growth literature we complement our findings.","[Taspinar, Suleyman] CUNY Queens Coll, Econ Program, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Dogan, Osman; Bera, Anil K.] Univ Illinois, Econ Program, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Taspinar, S (通讯作者)，CUNY Queens Coll, Econ Program, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.",staspinar@qc.cuny.edu; odogan10@gmail.com; abera@illinois.edu,"Dogan, Osman/AAW-3381-2021; Dogan, Osman/HJG-9407-2022","Dogan, Osman/0000-0001-7324-9454;","National Science Foundation [CNS-0958379, CNS-0855217, ACI-1126113]; City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); City University of New York High Performance Computing Center at the College of Staten Island,"We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for many pertinent comments and constructive suggestions.

The use of property rights among fishing cooperatives operating in Mexico's Gulf of California provides a compelling setting for theoretical and empirical analysis. A dynamic theoretical model demonstrates how fishing cooperatives' management choices are shaped by the presence of property rights, the mobility of resources, and predictable environmental fluctuations. More aggressive management comes in the form of the cooperative leadership paying lower prices to cooperative members for their catch, as lower prices disincentivize fishing effort. The model's implications are empirically tested using three years of daily logbook data on prices and catches for three cooperatives from the Gulf of California. One cooperative enjoys property rights while the other two do not. There is empirical evidence in support of the model: compared to the other cooperatives, the cooperative with strong property rights pays members a lower price, pays especially lower prices for less mobile species, and decreases prices when environmental fluctuations cause population growth rates to fall. The results from this case study demonstrate the viability of cooperative management of resources but also point toward quantitatively important limitations created by the mismatch between the scale of a property right and the scale of a resource.","[Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Leslie, Heather M.] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Mack-Crane, Austen] Brookings Inst, Ctr Social Dynam & Policy, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Nagavarapu, Sriniketh] Acumen LLC, Burlingame, CA 94010 USA; [Reddy, Sheila M.

Our empirical framework contains the possibility of stickiness in aggregate consumption growth and takes into account measurement error and time aggregation. Our empirical specification is cast into a Bayesian state-space model and estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We use a Bayesian model selection approach to deal with the non-regular test for the null hypothesis of no time variation in the excess sensitivity parameter. Anticipated disposable income growth is calculated by incorporating an instrumental variables estimation approach into our MCMC algorithm. Our results suggest that the excess sensitivity parameter in the USA is stable at around 0.23 over the entire sample period.

Our findings show that maintenance has a substantial impact on the rate of physical deterioration.

In this paper, we examine the structure of scientific collaboration in transportation research by building a coauthorship network using publication metadata from 22 transportation journals. In this network, a vertex represents a researcher and an edge represents the collaboration (coauthorship) between a pair of researchers. To build an accurate network, we propose and apply an efficient author name correction algorithm. The obtained network provides us with a tool to understand patterns of collaborations in transportation research. The results show an increasing trend of collaboration over the studied period (1990-2015), but different journals exhibit different patterns.

Unfortunately, the way that these tests work typically involves trading robustness for power or vice versa. The current paper takes this as its starting point to develop a new panel-based approach to predictability that is both robust and powerful. Specifically, while the panel route to increased power is not new, the way in which the cross-section variation is exploited also to achieve robustness with respect to the predictor is. The result is two new tests that enable asymptotically standard normal and chi-squared inference across a wide range of empirically relevant scenarios in which the predictor may be stationary, moderately non-stationary, nearly non-stationary, or indeed unit root non-stationary. The type of cross-section dependence that can be permitted in the predictor is also very general, and can be weak or strong, although we do require that the cross-section dependence in the regression errors is of the strong form. What is more, this generality comes at no cost in terms of complicated test construction. The new tests are therefore very user-friendly.

Moreover, the consumption response is concentrated in credit card spending and is stronger among individuals with limited access to credit market or with a high precautionary saving motive.

In competitive retail and transportation markets, such tax can be expected to lower the demand and thereby reduce CO2 emissions of road transports. However, as we show in this paper, such tax might also slow down the transition towards e-tailing. Considering that previous research indicates that a consumer switching from brick-and-mortar shopping to e-tailing reduces her CO2 emissions substantially, the direction and magnitude of the environmental net effect of the tax is unclear. In this paper, we assess the net effect in a Swedish regional retail market where the tax not yet is in place. We predict the net effect on CO2 emissions to be positive, but off-set by about 50% because of a slower transition to e-tailing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For that purpose, it investigates whether sub-Saharan African countries have shown a change in trend in their per capita GDP and whether these countries are closing the gap with developed economies, taking as reference the long-run per capita income growth rate of the USA. To test for changes in the level or in the trend, we use the algorithm developed by Kejriwal and Perron (J Time Ser Anal 31:305-328, 2010. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9892.2010.00666.x) to detect structural breaks for each sub-Saharan African country for the period 1950-2010 and then verify whether per capita income paths eventually converge to their long-run trend. We find evidence that some countries have been doing well since their independence. They include Botswana, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Rwanda and Seychelles. After having a poor performance, we also find that some others have changed their luck and have started a catching up process.

Examining state activity in international negotiations",REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,International negotiations; Negotiation Activity; States; Capacity; Power; Opportunity-structures; Incentives,UNITED-NATIONS; REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS; DOMESTIC POLITICS; DECISION-MAKING; RATIONAL CHOICE; EUROPEAN-UNION; FOREIGN-AID; DESIGN; INSTITUTIONALISM; LOGIC,"The institutional design of international organizations usually expresses state sovereignty, as each state has the same formal rights and obligations. This includes equal speaking rights in international negotiations. Becoming vocal is a means for states to signal national interests and influence international norms as well as to express their sovereignty. However, an analysis of 520 international negotiations demonstrates that states vary considerably in the usage of speaking rights. To addresses this puzzle, the paper presents an opportunity structure-incentives model and puts its observable implication to a comprehensive empirical test. This reveals that states operating in favourable conditions, most notably in small IOs, and states pursuing a broad scope of interests, being powerful and having strong international identities are most active in international negotiations. By contrast, smaller states that can neither rely on support of regional groups, nor on a government apparatus that effectively develops national positions are least likely to benefit from an equalizing institutional design of an international negotiation arena. Hence, there are limits to the extent to which an equalizing institutional design of IOs and regimes is able to mitigate real world structural differences between states.","[Panke, Diana] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Belfortstr 20, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Panke, D (通讯作者)，Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Belfortstr 20, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",diana.panke@politik.uni-freiburg.de,,,Irish Research Council; German Research Council [PA 1257/3-1],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); German Research Council(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This paper is based on data generated in two research projects: Unequal Actors in Equalizing Institutions.

Recently, quantile regression models have been used successfully to capture the conditional quantiles of returns and to forecast VaR accurately. In this paper, we further explore nonlinearities in data and propose to couple realized measures with the nonlinear quantile regression framework to explain and forecast the conditional quantiles of financial returns. The nonlinear quantile regression models are implied by the copula specifications and allow us to capture possible nonlinearities, tail dependence, and asymmetries in the conditional quantiles of financial returns. Using high frequency data that covers most liquid US stocks in seven sectors, we provide ample evidence of asymmetric conditional dependence with different levels of dependence, which are characteristic for each industry. The backtesting results of estimated VaR favour our approach.","[Avdulaj, Krenar; Barunik, Jozef] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Avdulaj, Krenar; Barunik, Jozef] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18200, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Avdulaj, K (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.;Avdulaj, K (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18200, Czech Republic.",krenar.avdulaj@gmail.com,"Avdulaj Ph.D., Krenar/GSD-7512-2022; Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014","Barunik, Jozef/0000-0001-5097-2607",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097]; Grant Agency of the Charles University (GA UK) [162815],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Grant Agency of the Charles University (GA UK),"We are grateful to the editor, Fredj Jawadi, the two anonymous referees, and the participants at the 2nd International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics for many useful comments and suggestions.

However, empirical studies remain sparse and the potential relevance of the concept of temporality, hitherto somewhat neglected even in wider sociological studies of organizations, has not been considered in terms of the light that it can shed on the experience of work as meaningful. These two disparate bodies of thought are brought together to generate new accounts of work meaningfulness through the lens of temporality. Findings from a qualitative study of workers in three occupations with ostensibly distinct temporal landscapes are reported. All jobs had the potential to be both meaningful and meaningless; meaningfulness arose episodically through work experiences that were shared, autonomous and temporally complex. Schutz's notion of the vivid present' emerged as relevant to understanding how work is rendered meaningful within an individual's personal and social system of relevances.","[Bailey, Catherine] Univ Sussex, Dept Business Management, Management, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Madden, Adrian] Univ Greenwich, Dept Human Resources & Org Behav, Employment Relat, London, England",University of Sussex; University of Greenwich,"Bailey, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England.",K.bailey@sussex.ac.uk,"Bailey, Catherine/JPK-5151-2023","Bailey, Catherine/0000-0002-8741-3072",,,,,45,109,122,4,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Our investigation is carried out under two nonlinear diffusion frameworks, the NLDCEV and the CIRCEV frameworks, and our focus is on the nonlinearity in regime-dependent drift and diffusion terms, the switching components, and the endogeneity in regime changes. While we find strong evidence of regime-switching effects, models with a switching diffusion term capture the VIX dynamics considerably better than models with only a switching drift, confirming the presence and importance of volatility regimes. Strong evidence of nonlinear endogeneity in regime changes is also detected. Meanwhile, we find significant nonlinearity in the regime-dependent diffusion specification, suggesting that the nonlinearity in the VIX dynamics cannot be accounted for by regime-switching effects alone. Finally, we find that models based on the CIRCEV specification are significantly closer to the true data generating process of VIX than models based on the NLDCEV specification uniformly across all regime-switching specifications.","[Bu, Ruijun] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Dept Econ Finance & Accounting, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Cheng, Jie] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Math Sci, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hadri, Kaddour] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Liverpool; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; Queens University Belfast,"Bu, R (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Dept Econ Finance & Accounting, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",ruijunbu@liv.ac.uk,,"Bu, Ruijun/0000-0002-3947-3038",ESRC [ES/J00622X/1]; British Academy [SG131649]; ESRC [ES/J00622X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); British Academy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors wish to thank all session participants at the 2nd International Workshop on Financial Markets and Nonlinear Dynamics (Paris, June 2015) for their constructive comments.

In our theoretical framework, decision makers evaluate the consequences of their choices relative to both their own and their peers' conditions. We test experimentally whether the position in the social ranking affects risk attitudes. Subjects interact in a simulated workplace environment where they perform a work task, receive possibly different wages, and then undertake a risky decision that may produce an extra gain. We find that social comparison matters for risk attitudes. Subjects are more risk averse in the presence of small social gain than social loss. In addition, risk aversion is decreasing in the size of the social gain.","[Gamba, Astrid; Manzoni, Elena; Stanca, Luca] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Stanca, Luca] Univ Milano Bicocca, NEURO MI, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Gamba, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",astrid.gamba@unimib.it; elena.manzoni@unimib.it; luca.stanca@unimib.it,,"Manzoni, Elena/0000-0003-0223-8760",Max Planck Institute of Economics (Jena); PRIN New Approaches to political economy,Max Planck Institute of Economics (Jena); PRIN New Approaches to political economy,"We are grateful to the Max Planck Institute of Economics (Jena) for financial support, Ria Stangneth and Claudia Zellman for technical assistance in the lab.

The specific determinants studied are identified, not only from the pre-collection of data conducted on the field, but also as a result of an analysis of the scientific literature. The variables studied in this research are: business growth (net profit after tax), corporate social responsibility (donations and sponsorships), investment in research and development, use of external expertise, taxation of the business by Government (direct and indirect taxes) and access to energy by businesses. The sample studied concerns the case of 1,025 businesses in the Republic of Benin, between 2008 and 2013. The information collected from the businesses studied emanates from their financial reports over the period covered by the study. Using the random effects panel regression method, this study shows the importance of the factors studied and proposes a contextualized analysis model, based on the selected factors. The results of the random model estimate indicate that the variables referred to as sponsorships, use of external expertise, investments in infrastructure (II) and indirect dues and taxes (IDDT) are significant at different thresholds irrespective of sector. In other words, they have an impact on the growth rates of businesses regardless of their sector of activity. The study also shows the importance of aspects such as the use of external expertise, investments in research and development, and corporate social responsibility for large and very large businesses in the sample studied.","[Aihounhin, Segbedji Parfait] Laval Univ, Fac Adm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Su, Zhan] Laval Univ, Fac Adm, Stephen A Jarislowsky Chair Int Business, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Aihounhin, SP (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, Fac Adm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",sapaf2000@gmail.com; zhan.su@fsa.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,649,675,,,,,,27,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000068,0

In order to measure the quality of institutional system, a synthetic measure based on multivariate analysis techniques was proposed. To obtain the institutional measure, TOPSIS method was applied. To quantify the institutional factors, the data from Fraser Institute was used. As diagnostic variables of quality of institutions, 29 variables qualified to four aspects of national institutional systems were used: (a) formal regulations influencing entrepreneurship, (b) effectiveness of juridical system in keeping low level of transaction costs and supporting effectiveness of market mechanism, (c) competitive pressure and effectiveness of labor markets, and (d) financial market institutions as a stimulator of development of enterprises with high growth potential. The Human Development Index (HDI) proposed within United Nations Development Programme was used for measuring the quality of life. The estimation of relation between institutions and the human development was made with econometric dynamic panel model. The estimation was made for 24 European Union countries for the years 2004-2010. The econometric analysis shows the positive influence of quality of institutions on the human development in the context of knowledge-based economy in developed countries.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland; [Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland.",apb@umk.pl,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373",,,,,28,20,23,2,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,231,241,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_18,0.0,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400018,0

Both events suggest yet another rethinking' of International Political Economy (IPE). Yet we have been here before. After the global financial crisis of 2008, Open Economy Politics' (OEP) was criticized for being unable to either anticipate or adequately explain the global financial crisis. Now that IPE has been caught short twice in a decade, any rethinking must go beyond critique and beyond OEP. To stop being surprised, we argue that IPE needs to shift its focus from micro-foundations back to macro-effects. IPE today strangely lacks an appreciation for the global macroeconomics that drives the outcomes it has such difficulty explaining, such as recurring financial bubbles, increasing levels of inequality, and the global rise of populism. Bringing the global macroeconomy back into the IPE, we argue, is a necessary corrective.","[Blyth, Mark] Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Watson Inst Int & Publ Affairs, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Matthijs, Matthias] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC USA",Brown University; Johns Hopkins University,"Blyth, M (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Watson Inst Int & Publ Affairs, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,,106,109,118,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

An important issue is the inconsistent industry definition of capacity credits for resources whose availability may be limited, such as renewable generation. Inaccurate credits can subsidize or penalize different resources, and consequently distort investment between renewables and non-renewables, and also among different types and locations of renewables. Using Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) data, we use a market equilibrium model to quantify the resulting loss of efficiency due to capacity credits alone and in combination with renewable tax subsidies and portfolio standards. Layering inaccurate capacity credits with existing US federal tax subsidies decreases efficiency as much as 6.3% compared to optimal capacity crediting under those subsidies. Compensating producers based on their marginal contributions to system adequacy, considering how renewable penetration affects the timing of net load peaks, can yield an efficient capacity market design.","[Bothwell, Cynthia; Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Bothwell, C (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",cbothwe1@jhu.edu,,,"NSF [OISE 1243482, ECCS 1230788]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by NSF grants OISE 1243482 (WINDINSPIRE) and ECCS 1230788.,,25,27,31,1,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2017,38.0,,,,1,,173,188,,10.5547/01956574.38.SI1.cbot,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EW9PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402851300012,0

Oftentimes, it is assumed that autocrats, usually potent presidents, wield informal powers and control farflung patron-client networks that undermine formal institutions and bolster their rule. After the institutional turn in authoritarianism studies, elections, parties, legislatures, or courts have taken center stage, yet presidencies and public law are still on the margins of this research paradigm. This paper proposes a method for measuring subconstitutional presidential power and its change by federal law, decrees, and Constitutional Court rulings as well as a theoretical framework for explaining when and under which conditions subconstitutional presidential power expands. It is argued that as a result of a gradual, small-scale, and slow-moving process of layering, presidential powers have been accumulated over time. This furthers the institutionalization of presidential advantage toward other federal and regional institutions, which in turn contributes to the consolidation of authoritarianism.","[Burkhardt, Fabian] Univ Bremen, Res Ctr East European Studies, Bremen, Germany; [Burkhardt, Fabian] Grad Sch East Southeast European Studies, Munich, Germany; [Burkhardt, Fabian] German Inst Int & Secur Affairs, Berlin, Germany",University of Bremen,"Burkhardt, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Res Ctr East European Studies, Bremen, Germany.;Burkhardt, F (通讯作者)，Grad Sch East Southeast European Studies, Munich, Germany.;Burkhardt, F (通讯作者)，German Inst Int & Secur Affairs, Berlin, Germany.",fabian.burkhardt@posteo.de,"Burkhardt, Fabian/V-1560-2018","Burkhardt, Fabian/0000-0003-0789-9410",Graduate School for East and South East European Studies at LMU Munich as part of the German Federal and State Excellence Initiative [German Research Association (DFG)] [DFG-GSC 1046],Graduate School for East and South East European Studies at LMU Munich as part of the German Federal and State Excellence Initiative [German Research Association (DFG)],Financial support for this research was provided by the Graduate School for East and South East European Studies at LMU Munich as part of the German Federal and State Excellence Initiative [German Research Association (DFG) grant number DFG-GSC 1046].,,159,12,13,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The agricultural depression of the early 1920's, which brought change in relative prices of farm products as well as a general lowering of the farmer's purchasing power, gave the signal for renewed emphasis on the study of the dynamic forces which bring about price changes and for a study of the possibilities of a reshaping of agriculture to adjust supply to demand on the basis of a satisfactory price. Henry C. Taylor - head of BAE - began an ambitious program of producing an annual outlook for agricultural production. He developed a program for collecting agricultural statistics and for developing quantitative methods in order to forecast crops and yields (Taylor and Taylor 1952). This paper is organized as follows. The first section will present the new method of the BAE about the analysis of the acreage. We will use the works of Bean (1929a, 1929b) and Smith B. B. (1925a, 1925b, 1928) - BAE economists -. These authors develop a new analytical method - multiple and partial correlation method - designed to better understand the link between the acreage and the agricultural prices. Our second section will be devoted to the yield forecasting. For this, the BAE study focuses on the impact of the agricultural meteorology on the yields. We will use the works of Smith B. B. (1925c) and Waugh (1929a, 1929b). All these authors use extensively the correlation tool to enable better predictions.","[Chancellier, Eric] Univ Lorraine, Econ, Lorraine, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Chancellier, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, Econ, Lorraine, France.",eric.chancellier@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,95,0,0,1,14,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The study from which evidence is drawn was conducted through a common methodology of representative surveys of the adult population in two big citiesShanghai and St Petersburg. The investigation shows that although people in Russia and China have broadly egalitarian attitudes, there are significant differences in the way in which Russians and Chinese regard the current system of distribution. Attitudes to social inequality are much more complicated than a direct link with the objective social situation would suggest. Egalitarian attitudes are connected not only with the actual incomes but they are very powerfully affected by subjective assessments of the distributive system. The essay argues that behind a tendency towards the convergence of political regimes in the two countries at the present time there are different patterns of legitimacy based not only on economic achievement but also on the attitudes of the population, which the ruling elites use in seeking to strengthen their monopoly.","[Danilova, Elena] RAS, Inst Sociol, Krzhizhanovskogo 24-35,B5, Moscow 117218, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Federal Center of Theoretical & Applied Sociology - FCTAS; Institute of Sociology of the RAS,"Danilova, E (通讯作者)，RAS, Inst Sociol, Krzhizhanovskogo 24-35,B5, Moscow 117218, Russia.",endanilova@gmail.com,"Danilova, Elena/R-9026-2017","Danilova, Elena/0000-0001-8818-3240",ESRC [ES/J012688/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J012688/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,48,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN,2017,69.0,1,,,,,27,52,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1273317,0.0,,,26,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,EM0UY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395034400003,0

The simulation results suggest three policy lessons or rules of thumb. When a resource price change is positive and temporary, the best strategy is to save the revenue windfall in a sovereign fund and use the interest income from the fund to raise citizens' consumption over time. This strategy is preferred to investing in public capital domestically, even when private investment benefits from an enhanced public capital stock. Domestic investment raises the prices of domestic goods, leaving less money for government to transfer to households; public investment is not 100 percent effective in raising output. In the presence of a negative temporary resource price change, however, the best strategy is to cut public investment. This strategy dominates other methods, such as trimming government transfers to households, which reduces consumption directly, or borrowing, which incurs an interest premium as debt rises. In the presence of persistent (positive and negative) shocks, the best strategy is a mix of public investment and saving abroad in a balanced regime that provides a natural insurance against both types of price shocks. The combination of interest income from the sovereign fund, transfers to households, and output growth brought about by public investment provides the best protective mechanism to smooth consumption over time in response to changing resource prices.","[Devarajan, Shantayanan] World Bank, Middle East & North Africa Reg, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dissou, Yazid] Univ Ottawa, Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Go, Delfin S.] World Bank, Dev Prospects Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Robinson, Sherman] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; University of Ottawa; The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Devarajan, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, Middle East & North Africa Reg, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sdevarajan@worldbank.org; yazid.dissou@uottawa.ca; delfin.go@verizon.net; s.robinson@cgiar.org,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

With growing number of observations, the probability of outlier presence also rises. That is the reason of increase in importance to work with sufficiently robust methods. As it is known, standard methods are not able to work correctly with outliers and consequently standard estimates are usually biased. ARMA processes are frequently used in financial mathematics and one of the important steps is to estimate the order of a given process. Usually it is the second step in Box-Jenkins method after solving stationarity and seasonality. In this paper we present robust methods for ARMA order estimating and we compare them using a simulation study.

With the help of methods of correlation and regression analysis, the authors determine the most important factors of economic and social development of modern Russian regions. The objects of the research include regions of Russia of various sizes and various places in ranking of socioeconomic development-for the purpose of representativeness-Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts (leading regions), Kirov and Volgograd Oblasts (medium regions), and Kostroma and Pskov Oblasts (underdeveloped regions). The results of the analysis contradicted the provisions of existing concept of economic and social development of the region. Thus, instead of direct correlation of subsidizing and socioeconomic regional development, we can see reverse and insufficiently strong connection; instead of reverse connection between competition in regional markets and socioeconomic regional development, we see strong direct correlation. The influence of post-industrialization and development of foreign economic relations is insignificant. At the same time, the offered hypothesis on strong and direct influence of other factors on socioeconomic development of a region-investments, interaction of state and business within public-private partnership, level of informatization, and innovative activity-was confirmed. This shows that the use of existing concept could be a reason for high aptitude of Russian regions to economic crises. That is why as an alternative to existing concept of economic and social development of a region, this work offers a new proprietary concept, adapted to modern economic conditions and requirements of global crisis management.","[Grabar, Anna A.; Kuklin, Andrey V.; Prokopenko, Lyudmila K.] Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia",Vyatka State University,"Grabar, AA (通讯作者)，Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia.",a.a.grabar@gmail.com,"Kuklin, Andrey/JQJ-5090-2023","Kuklin, Andrey/0000-0002-4195-106X",,,,,19,3,3,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,15,20,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_3,0.0,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200003,0

This paper is aimed at investigating whether the PKI implementation in public institution such as the Federation BiH Tax Administration contributes to improving its process, enhancing performance and quality of public services, including the end-user satisfaction. The research focuses on the two most extensive and basic processes of Tax Administration (TA): the tax form submission and the issuance of tax payment certificates. The methodology includes comparison between the existing AS IS model, based on the manual authentication and the new  TO BE model, which includes the PKI implementation. The research findings indicate that TO BE model has contributed to the process optimization, including a complete automation of the user authentication and authorization processes. Therefore, the filling of tax return process is carried out in 5, instead of previous 14 different processes, resulting in significant costs in savings and time. On the other hand, a successful PKI implementation depends on the understanding and commitment of staff, including their readiness to change. To that end, they were asked to respond to a questionnaire on their experiences with the PKI. The sample included 37 respondents, who work in different tax offices. It is encouraging that 89% of them are convinced that the PKI implementation in their institution would significantly improve their tasks and processes, enabling them to develop partnerships with taxpayers.","[Habul, Aida; Pilav-Velic, Amila] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Teftedarija, Mirza] Tax Adm, Federat Bosnia & Herzegovina, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Pilav-Velic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",amila.pilav-velic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Pilav-Velic, Amila/JAC-1971-2023",,,,,,11,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,299,314,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_23,0.0,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400023,0

The decision sent shockwaves around Britain, Europe, and the world: the Brexit'-vote presents the first instance that a country has voted to exit a major supranational institution, putting both the European integration project and the future of the United Kingdom in a globalized world into question. At the time of writing, four months after the referendum vote, the contours of Brexit remain unclear. Yet even within this short time frame, Brexit politics have been remarkable on both the domestic and the international level. In this paper, we first present a brief overview of IPE research in the open economy politics (OEP) tradition. We then discuss the insights OEP provides that help us to better understand the referendum vote and Brexit politics, but also emphasize that they present a number of puzzles for OEP-inspired researchers. Based on this analysis, the final section suggests avenues for advancing the OEP research program.","[Walter, Stefanie] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Int Relat & Polit Econ, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,,walter@ipz.uzh.ch,"Walter, Stefanie/A-5418-2012","Walter, Stefanie/0000-0002-0804-5647",,,,,122,44,48,0,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The aim of the study is to investigate volatility spillovers between food, energy, US dollar and equity markets. The analysis uses daily series of volatility of corn, soybean, wheat, rice, US dollar, crude oil, and SP500 futures covering the period from January 4, 2000 to December 30, 2016. We base our analysis on forecast-error variance decompositions in a generalized vector autoregressive framework, which are invariant to the ordering of variables, as proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). The data are studied in rolling subsamples, since the evolution of relationships is expected. Taking into account a large number of parameters in the models in single iterations, lasso estimation methods are used. The results of the study reveal that both total and directional volatility spillovers change in time. Most volatility transmissions are observed among the same category of instruments, i.e. the financial instrument group or the agricultural commodity group. Corn is the most important agricultural commodity, as it transmits vast volatility to other instruments in the food market.","[Smiech, Slawomir; Papiez, Monika; Fijorek, Kamil] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Smiech, S (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",smiechs@uek.krakow.pl; papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; fijorekk@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018; Fijorek, Kamil/T-3008-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Fijorek, Kamil/0000-0003-1262-6425","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) [2012/07/B/HS4/00700]","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland)","This paper is supported by funds from the National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) through grant No. 2012/07/B/HS4/00700.",,14,2,2,0,3,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,407,416,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000042,0

In order to solve these problems, we must follow five basic principles in the process of cultural development and adopt four practical and feasible measures.","[Sui Baolu] Zaozhuang Univ, Sch Polit & Social Dev, Zaozhuang 277160, Shandong, Peoples R China",Zaozhuang University,"Sui, BL (通讯作者)，Zaozhuang Univ, Sch Polit & Social Dev, Zaozhuang 277160, Shandong, Peoples R China.",sbl630205@sina.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,269,273,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200060,0

To carry out a statistical analysis, theoretical models of income distribution have been used, including Burr distributions. They will allow to describe the distribution of income from abroad and the total income of households having income from abroad compared to households without such income.

This issue is illustrated directly on several successful examples from Slovak environment. Since numerous scientific approaches consider human facial expressions as the most accurate representation of the internal human experiences, theoretical conclusions are supported by the results of measurements using software Emotion ID. It is a software solution that analyses the responses of people watching the video and transcribe them into statistical data. In addition to the relationship between positive emotions and eventual success of advertising, also other aspects are involved in the process. Since the recipient does not rate advertising according to every viewed moment, as in the most successful Slovak ads, we can observe basic function of the so-called peak-end effect. According to this theory are human emotions based on several key moments in the narrative of the ad. Results showed that with proper application of this pattern, the maximum intensity of the experience manifests itself most precisely at those respondents who reportedly seen advertising message several times. Another area on which the article focuses is building the characters that appear in commercials. Important is not just only their believability, but also consistency and motivation. In this paper, we seek to unravel the relationship between the success and likeability of advertisements and the human emotions by examining the importance of peak-end experience and elements relating to character.","[Vitekova, Ivana] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Nitra, Slovakia",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Vitekova, I (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Nitra, Slovakia.",ivana.vitekova@ukf.sk,,,,,,,26,0,0,3,10,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,381,391,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000039,0

The spatial pattern follows a negative exponential under the conditions derived by Brueckner (1982) and McDonald and Kim (1987). Research has demonstrated that these exponential density gradients have flattened over time due to rising income and falling transportation costs. This paper identifies a heretofore unknown property in a monocentric city with negative exponential population density, the unitary elasticity property (UEP). If a city is characterized by a constant density gradient, even if the slope of that gradient is changing over time, the sum of the elasticity of central density and the elasticity of land area with respect to population change will be approximately equal to unity. When this new prediction is tested, it fits US cities fairly well. Further analysis demonstrates that topographic barriers and age of housing stock are the key factors explaining the deviation from the UEP.","[Zhao, Weihua] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Room 153, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of Louisville,"Zhao, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Room 153, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",weihua.zhao@louisville.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,3,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Taking the opportunity of industrial transformation, China not only aims to overtake the mass auto industry, but also to shift into fast lane in developing indigenous premium(1)new energy vehicles (NEV). Premium auto industry represents the peak of market & technical trends. To spur China's premium NEV development, it is essential to evaluate the platform of enabling premium NEV development in China by studying German premium NEV activities in this market. This paper reviews China's NEV market and German premium automakers via a hexagonal framework: policy, market, technologies, charging, electricity efficiencies comparison and a case study of premium NEV activity heat map in Beijing. German NEV automakers are less active based on disadvantages over policy-supported Chinese players. In order to encourage market oriented NEV industrial development, 'policy and market integration' is essential: subsidy policies should be in place to promote technical innovations, while market should be more inclusive for foreign players to enable healthy market competitions.","[Hu, Zheng] BMW Grp, Beijing 100027, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jiahai] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab New Energy & Low Carbon Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jiahai] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University,"Yuan, JH (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab New Energy & Low Carbon Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",yuanjh126@126.com,"Yuan, Jiahai/I-9186-2019","Yuan, Jiahai/0000-0002-1150-7750",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673085],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the funding of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71673085).

In abstract argumentation, arguments are viewed as abstract entities whose validities are determined according to a binary attack relation. When forming a collective attack relation, parts of it may be reserved to members of the society who hold expert knowledge. I prove that when only a binary evaluation of each argument is permitted, even under a minimal condition of rationality, the assignment of expert rights to two or more agents may be inconsistent with the condition of strong unanimity. Since argumentation aggregation is a particular case of judgement aggregation, this result might be a corollary of Dietrich and List (Soc Choice Welf 31(1):59-78, 2008), if the agenda I consider turns out to be connected in their sense, an issue that this paper has not been able to settle.","[Li, Nan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Edifice Gezhi,555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Li, N (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Edifice Gezhi,555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",nanli@swufe.edu.cn,,"Li, Nan/0000-0003-3760-4716",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion de Espana; FEDER [ECO2008-04756],Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion de Espana(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"My greatest debt is to Salvador Barbera.

We find that, based on the partial elasticity measure, electricity is the least-responsive fuel to changes in its own price and in the price of other fuels. The total elasticity measure, which adjusts the partial elasticity for changes in aggregate energy demand induced by individual fuel price changes, reveals that the demand for electricity is much more price responsive than the partial elasticity suggests. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for the feedback effect between interfactor and interfuel elasticities when considering the effectiveness of environmental taxation. We use the estimated elasticities to simulate the impact of a (sic)15/tCO(2) carbon tax on average energy-related CO2 emissions. The carbon tax results in a small reduction in CO2 emissions from oil and gas use, but this reduction is partially offset by an increase in emissions due to increased electricity consumption by some firms.","[Hyland, Marie] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Hyland, Marie] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Haller, Stefanie] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Hyland, M (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",hylandm1@tcd.ie,,,Science Foundation Ireland [09/SRC/E1780]; ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre,Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre,"This work makes use of data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

It is surprising that so little research within the economics literature has examined the efficacy of stormwater retention ponds. We address this gap in the literature by (1) offering a brief review of the existing literature; (2) discussing the nature of retention ponds as an impure public good; (3) extending a theoretical model to explain how stormwater runoff is currently managed; and (4) offering illustrative examples of governmental stormwater management practices in the coastal region of South Carolina. We posit that the current regulatory environment leads to a less than socially optimal level of management including a general lack of compliance enforcement and a misunderstanding of resource ownership. If sea levels continue to rise due to global climate change, then the mismanagement of stormwater runoff can lead to potentially severe adverse effects within coastal watersheds and estuarine ecosystems.

Provided that annuities' return is sufficiently large, and notably when it is fair, positive annuitization is known to be the optimal strategy of ambiguity neutral individuals. Conversely, we show that the demand for annuities decreases with ambiguity aversion and that there exists a finite degree of aversion above which the demand is non-positive: the optimal strategy is then to either sell annuities short or to hold zero annuities if the former option is not available. To conclude, ambiguity aversion appears to be a relevant candidate for explaining the annuity puzzle.","[d'Albis, Hippolyte] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Thibault, Emmanuel] CDED, Toulouse Sch Econ, Perpignan, France; [Thibault, Emmanuel] Univ Perpignan, Perpignan, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia,"d'Albis, H (通讯作者)，CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",hdalbis@psemail.eu,,"d'Albis, Hippolyte/0000-0002-6409-4320",,,,,46,7,7,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,OCT,2018,85.0,3-4,,,,,303,319,,10.1007/s11238-018-9658-8,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GY3JH,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448446600002,0

While agreement provisions governing intellectual property are commonly thought to be an important driver of corporate preferences over US trade policy, systematic empirical evidence for this proposition, especially in comparison to other determinants of trade policy, is generally lacking. To fill this void, this paper examines variation in reliance on intellectual property across US industries to explain attitudes and lobbying on US trade agreements. The effects of IP provisions on support for US trade agreements are politically substantial, though trade remains the primary determinant of preferences over trade agreements.","[Osgood, Iain; Feng, Yilang] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Haven Hall,505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Osgood, I (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Haven Hall,505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",iosgood@umich.edu; ylfeng@umich.edu,,,,,,,77,14,18,4,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

I describe three alternatives that generate partial orders for group performances. I define partial orders based on the first- and second-order dominance, two classes of performance measures, and two sets of basic transformations, and I prove equivalence theorems between them.

We present a case from North Carolina biosciences to demonstrate the contribution to regional industrial specialization when specialists combine their respective knowledge of entrepreneurship and industrial recruitment and coordinate development practice. More than an adjustment to tightening budget constraints or intensifying political demand, strategy mixing allows practitioners to extend and capture greater gains from state support for innovation.

At this point travelers living in small and mid-sized regions likely began leaking, or abandoning their local airport to take flights from hub airports offering more convenient flight options. The extent of this practice, however, is not well established. Our study asks to what extent airline consolidation deepened the divide in service levels between airports that are 100-300 miles apart, and seeks to estimate the magnitude of air traveler leakage at small and medium airports across the U.S. We estimate that travelers living in small and mid-sized metropolitan regions have the incentive to leak from their airport to a distant, better-served airport. Our estimates suggest that 15.7%-31.8% of the total passengers living proximate to a small or mid-sized airport have the incentive to leak. Our estimates range from 10.8% to 33.0% for travelers facing a non-stop itinerary from their local airport and 33.3%-85.1% for travelers facing a connecting itinerary. The potential leaked passengers contribute 1-2.75% of average daily highway traffic at heavily congested portions of the interstate highways connecting airports and up to 10-12% of traffic on low density portions of the highway. Our study illustrates the relationship between interregional surface transportation and the aviation system by estimating the number of travelers who may choose to travel long distances by car to access a relatively busier, larger airport with better service. The results of this study help to shape the evolving role of airport managers in controlling demand and delay at major hub airports and in building and managing air service and smaller airports across the U.S.","[Ryerson, Megan S.] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Dept City & Reg Planning, 102 Meyerson Hall,210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kim, Amy M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Donadeo Innovat Ctr Engn 6 269, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Pennsylvania; University of Alberta,"Ryerson, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Dept City & Reg Planning, 102 Meyerson Hall,210 South 34th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mryerson@design.upenn.edu; amy.kim@ualberta.ca,,"Kim, Amy/0000-0002-5250-2796",,,,,72,11,12,0,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In his seminal study, Flandreau found no evidence of an overall positive effect of the LMU on trade. In this article, I estimate the effects of this currency agreement on trade. In my gravity model I explicitly take into account the changing conditions in the international environment that affected the LMU underlying economic foundations (i.e., the limits on silver coinage agreed upon in 1874) and its rules (i.e., the liquidation clause of 1885). I also test the existence of heterogeneous effects on bilateral trade within the LMU. In line with Flandreau, I find no significant LMU trade effects. However, I find support for the hypothesis that the LMU had significant trade effects for the period 1865-1874. These effects were nonetheless concentrated in trade flows between France and the rest of LMU members, following a hub-and-spokes structure. Moreover, I find evidence for the existence of a 1874 LMU-wide structural break, which affected the course of trade flows within the Union.","[Timini, Jacopo] Banco Espana, Madrid, ES, Spain; [Timini, Jacopo] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Getafe, ES, Spain",Banco de Espana; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Timini, J (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Madrid, ES, Spain.;Timini, J (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Getafe, ES, Spain.",jacopo.timini@bde.es,,"TIMINI, JACOPO/0000-0002-0745-0819",People Programme (Marie-Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under REA [608129],People Programme (Marie-Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under REA(European Union (EU)),The author acknowledge funding from the People Programme (Marie-Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under REA grant agreement no. 608129 (MACROHIST).,,70,7,8,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Using primary data and information collected from selected state-funded minor irrigation projects implemented in Cuttack district of the state, the paper finds that the Pani Panchayats, being backed by The Orissa Pani Panchayat Act (2002) and following a democratic decision making process, have been successful in managing the irrigation projects efficiently, especially in respect of pricing and distribution of irrigation water, maintenance of the systems, and their expansion, leading to socially inclusive and sustainable agricultural intensification in the area.","[Behera, Bhagirath; Mishra, Pulak] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Human & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Behera, B (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Human & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",bhagirath@hss.iitkgp.ernet.in; pmishra@hss.iitkgp.ernet.in,,,"National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Mumbai; NABARD","National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Mumbai; NABARD","The idea of this paper originated from the field experiences in connection with studies funded by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Mumbai.

Between 2000 and 2013, the Pennsylvania Game Commission acquired over 85,000 acres across the state of Pennsylvania, thereby providing a promise of future openness for adjacent homeowners. This paper exploits the timing and spatial variation of these acquisitions to identify the housing premium associated with open space preservation. Results suggest that preservation increases the average adjacent home value by between $22,326 and $31,178. I analyze various sources of this premium and conclude that it is driven by a preserved view and not new access to public land. Further, analysis comparing preservation of the land to continuing vacancy shows that preservation is tax-neutral for local governments.","[Black, Katie Jo] Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, 311 Ascension Hall, Gambier, OH 43022 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College,"Black, KJ (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, 311 Ascension Hall, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",blackk@kenyon.edu,,,,,,,18,7,11,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Common native language and immigrant networks stimulate bilateral trade relationships by reducing transaction costs through both market creation and the removal of information asymmetries. Whereas evidence on the importance of weak links for trade provides support for the first channel, the need for additional immigrants does not decline, if the second mechanism proves to be a driver of trade relationships. For estimation of a causal and nonlinear effect of the twocommon native language and immigrationon imports, we employ a flexible identification strategy, which allows common native language and migration to be endogenous. The results suggest that both common native language and immigration raise imports, but the impact of common native language is ever increasing with its level, whereas that of immigration is of declining importance as its level increases.","[Egger, Peter H.; Lassmann, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter H.] CEPR, London, England; [Egger, Peter H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter H.] WIFO, Vienna, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut,"Egger, PH (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.;Egger, PH (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Egger, PH (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Egger, PH (通讯作者)，WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,26,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2018,41.0,7,,,SI,,1903,1916,,10.1111/twec.12651,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GO3GZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439879000010,0

Results of a case study for commuters in the Stockholm public transport system suggest that there are preference differences among public transport modes. We found that the value of time for train is lower than for bus and metro, and that it is higher for auxiliary modes than for the main mode. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for differences proportional to the in-vehicle time between bus and metro, suggesting that characteristics of invehicle time in these two modes are valued equally by the travellers. Nevertheless, unobserved preference for metro is higher than the preference for bus. Regarding the existence of a rail factor, we find evidence to support the hypothesis that rail-based modes have in fact a smaller time parameter (train) or higher alternative specific constant (metro), indicating that rail modes are preferable to bus, ceteris paribus.","[Varela, Juan Manuel Lorenzo; Borjesson, Maria] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Borjesson, Maria] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Linkoping, Sweden; [Daly, Andrew] ITS Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Royal Institute of Technology; VTI; University of Leeds,"Varela, JML (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",jmlv@kth.se,,"Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232; /0000-0003-4512-9054; Daly, Andrew/0000-0001-5319-2745","Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA; Swedish Transport Administration, TRAFIKVERKET","Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA(Vinnova); Swedish Transport Administration, TRAFIKVERKET","We thank the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA, for funding, along with the Swedish Transport Administration, TRAFIKVERKET.",,28,12,13,1,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The paper utilises new British data to analyse the cost side of this debate. Our data is unique in that we have cost data by route level for both the incumbent (corresponding to British franchises) and the open access operators, as opposed to only having cost data on the incumbent at the network level as in other countries. The open access operators are found to have comparable unit costs to franchised operators. This is unexpected considering the significant returns to density that benefit the larger franchised operators. This is subsequently found to be due to lower input prices and an 'open access business model' effect that outweigh any density disadvantages. Overall we find that there are negligible cost disadvantages of allowing open access operators to compete with franchised intercity operators.","[Wheat, Phill; Smith, Andrew S.

We offer two stylized facts for explanation: Leader change leads to dispute onset, and the effect is greater in autocracies than in democracies. We develop a model that explains changes in trade policy and dispute onset induced by shifts in the sectors represented in government when leaders change. Democracies protect a wider set of industries at shallower levels than do autocracies. When leaders change in autocracies, new sectors enter the winning coalition, resulting in new deeper barriers that spark disputes. When leaders change in democracies, the change in the winning coalition is not as stark, and the depth of the shifts in trade barriers is not that large, resulting is a smaller effect on dispute initiation.","[Rosendorff, B.

The randomized allocation of 39,936 insecticide-treated mosquito nets among 81,597 smallholder cotton farming households in 1,507 clusters helps evaluate this in the context of Zambia's cotton outgrowing industry. But despite large health impacts on treated households, no impact on cotton deliveries to the agribusiness is detected. With some caveats, the results tend to strike a discord with recent evidence on the agricultural productivity effects of malaria control.","[Sedlmayr, Richard] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Sedlmayr, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England.",richard.sedlmayr@gmail.com,,,Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH),Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH),"This work was supported by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH).

Contrary to previous analyses, we have considered the effects of the country's position in the FTA network on the bilateral trade of the hub country. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of the global network of FTAs, focusing particularly on its evolution in the last 15years. We have utilised a panel data set covering the period 1960-2010 to investigate the effects of the hub-and-spoke on trade. Our results show that the countries that are more connected to FTAs export more than those that are less involved, although not all the partner countries you can connect with are the same. An increase in the number of spokes that have no link between them has, on average, a negative effect on the trade of the hub, which indicates that signing FTAs with every country is not the optimal strategy for increasing trade. However, if we consider the way new FTAs change the relative position of a country, we can see that if new FTAs make the country more central or less constrained in the network, these new agreements have a strongly positive and significant pro-trade effect.","[Sopranzetti, Silvia] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Sopranzetti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,24,18,17,7,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1549,1566,,10.1111/twec.12599,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434646400004,0

Results are shown considering road accessibility to formal employment subcenters (private accessibility) and distance to the main public transport stations in the city (public accessibility). Results suggest that accessibility to employment subcenters is valued as an amenity by households but being closer to a Metro station is perceived as a disamenity. Moreover, households located in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of informal workers and with lower education levels give a lower value to private accessibility than households located in neighborhoods with a lower proportion of informal workers or in high-educated neighborhoods. These results are evidence of the existence of spatial segregation in the city where disadvantaged households are segregated, not only because of their economic conditions, but because they are located farther away from employment opportunities.

It is of utmost importance to reflect these needs in price signals, to align the incentives of market agents with the new challenges. The two-settlement system used by U.S. ISOs falls short to provide efficient intraday economic signals and a cost reflective allocation of intraday rescheduling costs. This paper advocates for a multi-settlement system, which entails calculating intraday prices as forecasts are updated and re-schedules are executed. This approach incorporates more granular prices, as in European intraday markets, while keeping the efficient centralized dispatch logic of the ISO model. A stylized case example illustrates the virtues of a multi-settlement system, which sends cost reflective signals, and consequently facilitates VER integration.","[Herrero, Ignacio; Rodilla, Pablo] Comillas Pontifical Univ, Inst Res Technol, Sta Cruz de Marcenado 26, Madrid, Spain; [Batlle, Carlos] MIT, Energy Initiat, 77 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Comillas Pontifical University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Herrero, I (通讯作者)，Comillas Pontifical Univ, Inst Res Technol, Sta Cruz de Marcenado 26, Madrid, Spain.",Ignacio.Herrero@comillas.edu; Pablo.Rodilla@comillas.edu; cbatlle@mit.edu,"Batlle, Carlos/AAF-1471-2022; Batlle, Carlos/AFG-4923-2022; Rodríguez, Pablo Rodilla/AAB-5309-2021","Batlle, Carlos/0000-0001-8451-5295; Batlle, Carlos/0000-0001-8451-5295; Rodríguez, Pablo Rodilla/0000-0002-3906-1957",Programa Estatal de I+ D+ i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; MIT Utility of the Future project,Programa Estatal de I+ D+ i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; MIT Utility of the Future project,"The authors would like to thank Dr. Eugene Litvinov (ISO-NE), and Andrew Levitt ( PJM) for their comments on the draft version of this paper.

Increased production from variable renewables however implies higher levels of optimal interconnection capacity than in the past. Rather than using scenario building to determine new optimal levels of interconnection capacity, this paper presents a new methodology for Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) based on empirical market data, using the French-German electricity trade as an example. Employing a very fine dataset of hourly supply and demand curves (aggregated auction curves) from the EPEX Spot market, it constructs net export (NEC) and net import demand curves (NIDC) for both countries. This allows assessing hourly welfare impacts for incremental capacity and, summed over the year, the annual welfare benefits for each discrete increase in interconnection capacity. Confronting benefits with the annualised costs of increasing interconnection capacity determines the socially optimal increase in interconnection capacity between France and Germany on the basis of empirical market micro-data.","[Keppler, Jan Horst; Meunier, William] Univ Paris 09, CEEM, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75116 Paris, France; [Meunier, William] Ecole Mines ParisTech, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Keppler, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, CEEM, Pl Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75116 Paris, France.",jan-horst.keppler@dauphine.fr,,,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - RTE; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - EDF; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - EPEX Spot; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - Celest,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - RTE; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - EDF; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - EPEX Spot; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation - Celest,"The authors thank Alexandre Coquentin for his contribution to the development of the methodological framework of this paper while working as a research assistant at the Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM).

This study revisits this discrepancy while focusing on information-search in decisions from experience. We report findings from a lab-experiment with three treatments: a standard version of decisions from description and two versions of decisions from experience: with and without a 'history table' recording previously sampled events. We find that people sample more from lotteries with rarer events. The history table proved influential; in its absence search is more responsive to cues such as a lottery's variance while in its presence the cue that stands out is the table's maximum capacity. Our analysis of risky choices captures a significant DE gap which is mitigated by the presence of the history table. We elicit probability weighting functions at the individual level and report that subjects overweight rare events in experience but less so than in description. Finally, we report a measure that allows us to compare the type of DE gap found in studies using choice patterns with that inferred through valuation and find that the phenomenon is similar but not identical across the two methods.","[Kopsacheilis, Orestis] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Kopsacheilis, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",orestiskopsacheilis@gmail.com,,"Kopsacheilis, Orestis/0000-0001-8794-6672",ESRC [ES/K002201/1],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),I am grateful to Robin Cubitt and Chris Starmer for their guidance throughout the research process as well as to Valeria Burdea for helpful advice and support during data collection.

The baseline model is an application of the De long, Shleifer, Summers and Waldman (1990) model of noise traders to the housing market, when the risky asset is housing. This adds new features to the model as households receive utility from housing services and cannot short-sell houses. The existence of noise traders in the housing market creates uncertainty about house prices, causes prices to deviate away from their fundamental values, and leads to a distortion in housing consumption. To investigate the impact of housing derivatives trading on the housing market, a new financial instrument, housing futures, is introduced into the baseline model. Housing futures trading affects house price stability through three channels: by (i) enabling households to disentangle their housing consumption decisions from investment decisions; (ii) allowing short-selling; and (iii) attracting an additional set of traders (pure speculators) looking for portfolio diversification opportunities. The results show that, for a large set of admissible parameter values, housing futures trading decreases the volatility of house prices and increases the welfare of households and investors.","[Uluc, Arzu] Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England",Bank of England,"Uluc, A (通讯作者)，Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",arzu.uluc@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,42,3,3,4,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, these pressures arise because the adverse effects of globalisation have been ignored. Some of these effects follow directly from elementary economic theory yet have been dismissed by cavalier misunderstandings of welfare economics. An increase in international trade has the potential to make everyone better off, but if those who gain do not actually compensate those who lose, the mere fact that they could do so is not a basis for concluding that the change has enhanced welfare. Other adverse effects can only be understood from recent advances. The link between social interaction and generosity implies that there can be costs to greater trans-national social connectivity.

Our modeling results suggest that shipping firms' network configuration is influenced by emission charge, fuel price, port loading and unloading cost, and demand pattern of cargo transport across different markets. Total emission will be reduced by an EU emission charge scheme. However, if the charge is above a threshold, carriers will reconfigure shipping networks to minimize their costs including emission charge payments. This will offset part of the emission reduction achieved by the emission scheme. As a result, a higher charge does not always lead to a higher emission reduction. The performance of major ports along the Asia-Europe routes will be influenced in different ways, leading to conflicting views from regional governments. These findings reveal possible regulation costs and market distortions associated with regional emission systems, and highlight the complex effects of international environmental policies when market dynamics are considered.","[Dai, Wayne Lei; Hu, Hao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Ocean Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiaowen] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yip, Tsz Leung] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kun] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Sydney; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of International Business & Economics,"Wang, K (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",dailei1989@sjtu.edu.cn; xiaowen.fu@sydney.edu.au; t.l.yip@polyu.edu.hk; hhu@sjtu.edu.cn; wqueenfox@gmail.com,"Yip, Tsz Leung/B-4288-2010; Wang, Kun/AAE-4337-2019; WANG, KUN/HDN-4021-2022","Yip, Tsz Leung/0000-0002-7277-7666; WANG, KUN/0000-0002-2137-9457; Fu, Xiaowen/0000-0002-1925-046X",,,,,43,33,37,2,46,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Bourdieu's metaphor of the game is applied to a case study of a regional Australian university, which underwent significant changes in 2007, the most notable being the introduction of performance appraisals. In-depth interviews (N=20) reveal evidence of symbolic violence: staff compliance with and complicity in the changes. This is evident in the way that the interviewees, mostly early career academics, chose to play the game by concentrating their efforts on increasing their capital within the new order. To further support this argument, signs of resistance to the new regime were explored. Findings show that vocal resistance was sparse with silence, neglect and exit being the more realistic options. The article concludes that it is academics' illusio, their unwavering commitment to the game, which neutralizes resistance by pitting colleagues against each other.","[Kalfa, Senia] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wilkinson, Adrian] Griffith Univ, Ctr Work Org & Wellbeing, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Gollan, Paul J.] Univ Wollongong, Fac Business, Management, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; Griffith University; University of Wollongong,"Kalfa, S (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Management, Level 4,E4A Bldg,Eastern Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",senia.kalfa@mq.edu.au,"Wilkinson, Adrian/B-5048-2008","Wilkinson, Adrian/0000-0001-7231-2861; Kalfa, Senia/0000-0002-6937-0961; Gollan, Paul/0000-0002-1296-8081",,,,,45,66,70,2,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The development of early European city states was founded on the risk sharing principle. The risk sharing financing helped these city states to develop their infrastructure and rule the scientific and economic landscape of the west. The Western financial system of today still carries traces of risk sharing in the form of venture capital financing, albeit the primary focus has diverted to risk shifting-based debt financing. Over the past decades, much effort and research has gone into establishing a viable set of Islamic financial institutions. Most Muslim nations are heavily indebted with high reliance on multilateral financing primarily based on high interest rates. This vicious cycle of interest rates and debt has stunted the growth of these nations and worsened the conditions of the masses. This research brings to the forefront the concept of an equity in nature GDP-linked paper, which allows for enhanced risk sharing-based sovereign financing. It aims to present empirical proof of the stability this instrument offers in economic growth, for a large sample of developing economies, comprising bulk of Islamic countries. While analysing the empirical work, a strong favourable argument for this instrument is derived for its benefits in stability. Through this study, we endeavour to initiate a thought-provoking and practical discussion for further development of these instruments for the betterment of developing countries.","[Rizvi, Syed Aun R.] LUMS, Lahore, Pakistan; [Arshad, Shaista] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ, Sch Business, Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia",Lahore University of Management Sciences; University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Rizvi, SAR (通讯作者)，LUMS, Lahore, Pakistan.",,"Rizvi, Syed Aun R/AAI-5807-2020; Rizvi, Syed Aun R./B-1215-2017","Rizvi, Syed Aun R./0000-0002-6976-299X",,,,,29,3,3,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,781,800,,10.1111/twec.12513,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300008,0

The analysis indicates that the effect of a monetary policy shock on house prices is large, while the effect on household credit is muted. This is consistent with a relatively small refinancing rate (refinancing rate refers to the share of outstanding mortgages that are refinanced each period due to changes in, for example, house prices or interest rate) of the mortgage stock each quarter.

Under what conditions do WTO members change domestic policies or measures that are challenged in WTO litigation? Starting from the assumption that policymakers are political-support maximizers who seek to avoid the mobilization of political enemies, we argue that the degree of integration in Global Value Chains (GVCs) of the economic sectors affected by a WTO dispute influences members' propensity to change domestic policies when targeted in WTO litigation. The initiation of a WTO dispute against sectors highly integrated in GVCs engenders the emergence of a domestic coalition of pro-trade liberalization groups composed of exporters seeking to avoid the imposition of retaliatory measures and import-dependent firms wishing to exploit the opportunity to access cheaper imports. Under these circumstances, trade-liberalizing responses to WTO legal challenges are therefore more likely. We test this hypothesis by estimating a Cox proportional hazard model and find that GVCs positively impact states' propensity to comply with the WTO dispute settlement panel rulings.","[Yildirim, Aydin B.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, St Jacobstr 2,M-272, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Chatagnier, J.

A contingent valuation study of Australian adults,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; HEALTH; SAFETY,"Background: Holding a driver licence is a vital part of life for many Australians, facilitating social connections and enabling access to employment, education and health services. There is a lack of evidence, however, about the value the community attaches to driver licences. This study investigates the monetary value that a sample of Australian adults place on holding a driver licence and how such valuations vary on the basis of individual characteristics. Methodology: A contingent valuation study of 1054 Australian adult licence holders (with an oversampling of Indigenous Australians) was carried out to derive the samples willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid losing their driver licence for a period of one year. Interval regression analyses were undertaken to determine the association between a range of demographic and driving-related characteristics of respondents and their WTP valuations. Results: The sample was representative of the Australian population in terms of state of residence and gender. Mean WTP based on the base model was $2290 to avoid losing a driver licence for a year (95% CI $2156-$2431). Indigenous participants had a mean WTP higher than other respondents ($2789 as opposed to $2240, p < .001). Once individual characteristics were controlled for, there was no significant difference in the WTP results between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants. WTP was significantly higher for respondents who drove multiple times a week ($396 higher WTP, p = .012) than those who did not and who required a car for work compared to those who did not ($520 p = .002). WTP increased with higher incomes and was greatest for those earning over $120,000 annually ($1352 higher than those earning under $40,000 per year, p < .001). Those living in urban areas had a significantly lower WTP compared to non-urban residents ($407 lower than other respondents, p = .012) and WTP decreased with age ($14 lower per additional year of age, p = .03). Those who had incurred a licence suspension in the past 5 years had significantly higher WTP ($1686 p < .001), than those who had not, and those who had incurred a traffic fine in the past 5 years reported a higher WTP than those who had not ($358 p = .032). Conclusions: Holding a driver licence was found to be of substantial value to participants. While support for alternative methods of transport is important, these results highlight the importance of programs to support driver licensing, and those addressing known disparities in licensing status across population groups, such as those faced by Australias Indigenous communities. Given the link between licensing and wider social and economic opportunities, such programs can potentially play a broad role in addressing social disadvantage and exclusion.","[Angell, Blake; Cullen, Patricia; Laba, Tracey; Lung, Tom; Sakashita, Chika; Ivers, Rebecca; Jan, Stephen] UNSW Sydney, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Angell, Blake] Univ Sydney, Poche Ctr Indigenous Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Laba, Tracey] Univ Sydney, Menzies Ctr Hlth Policy, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lung, Tom; Ivers, Rebecca; Jan, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Shanahan, Marian] UNSW, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Eades, Sandra] Baker IDI, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney; George Institute for Global Health; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute,"Angell, B (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",bangell@georgeinstitute.org.au,"Lung, Thomas/J-9686-2017; Eades, Sandra J/F-1137-2010; Cullen, Patricia/AAO-3350-2020; Jan, Stephen/AAG-3333-2021; Laba, Tracey-Lea/H-8908-2013; Eades, Sandra/C-1286-2014","Lung, Thomas/0000-0001-9978-6311; Cullen, Patricia/0000-0003-4652-0936; Ivers, Rebecca/0000-0003-3448-662X; Jan, Stephen/0000-0003-2839-1405; Laba, Tracey-Lea/0000-0002-5182-9092; Shanahan, Marian/0000-0001-9873-3576; Angell, Blake/0000-0002-7188-7740; Eades, Sandra/0000-0001-8629-3390",,,,,38,6,6,1,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This article challenges the sometimes taken-for-granted assumption that employer-led H&WB initiatives are inherently positive. It considers how they are being used to undermine statutory trade union health and safety representatives, reinforce concepts of normalcy and ableism in respect of worker lifestyle and impairments, and individualize/medicalize experiences of workplace stress. Utilizing a critical disability studies lens debate challenges a dominant element of many H&WB programmes - employee resilience - and concludes that a social model of disability and workplace well-being is needed to focus debate on the social, economic and political causes of ill-health and dis-ability in workplaces under neo-liberal austerity.","[Foster, Deborah] Cardiff Univ, Employment Relat, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Foster, D (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",FosterD1@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,27,29,2,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Using 19 waves of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS), where individuals and their families are followed from childhood to adulthood, this study analyses parental alcohol consumption during childhood (between 1994 and 2001) and its relation with children's educational attainment about twelve years later (from 2005 to 2014). Panel estimations show that mother's excessive alcohol consumption during childhood is consistently negatively associated with children educational outcomes, as years of education, the highest education grade achieved and the probability of having a tertiary education degree, a finding that is robust to possible endogeneity issues. In particular, while moderate drinking is not an issue, an additional standard glass of vodka (15.57 g of pure alcohol) consumed by the mother per day, reduces years of education by almost one year (0.88), and by 5.8 percentage points (or about 27%) the probability of having a university degree. The study also explores the transmission mechanisms suggested by the literature, identifying a significant role for prenatal exposure to alcohol and, to a lesser extent, for intergenerational transmission of drinking habits.

Because RTN's topological structure has become complicated with its scale, the phenomenon of overload operation frequently appears at stations or lines, reducing the stability of RTN in operation. There is a need to identify the key stations and to analyze the vulnerability of RTN in depth. This paper quantitatively analyzes statistical topology parameters of Beijing rail transit network (BRTN) based on complex network theory (CNT). The key stations are evaluated by different evaluation indicators, such as node degree, betweenness, and strength. Then, a model is proposed to analyze the cascading failures of weighted BRTN considering loading and redistribution of multi-static passenger flow based on coupled map lattices (CML). Results show that when the external perturbation is larger, the time of all stations failure is earlier once the failure is triggered. Moreover, the perturbation threshold for the cascading failure of weighted BRTN is determined. Transfer regularities of the risk stations in BRTN are researched under different combinations of the topological coupling coefficients and the flow coupling coefficients. Under attack, the threshold of loop line damaged is smaller than a straight line. And, while attacking the loop line, the discrete degree of peak time and all station failure time are higher under different perturbations, meaning that failure is hard to control. This study provides recommendations on developing strategies for RTN design and performance evaluation. Future studies will focus on the coordination of weighted complex public transit networks other than passenger flow redistribution within RTN.","[Sun, Lishan; Huang, Yuchen; Chen, Yanyan] Beijing Univ Technol, Beijing Collaborat Innovat Ctr Metropolitan Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Liya] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech & Vehicular Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Sun, LS (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Technol, Beijing Collaborat Innovat Ctr Metropolitan Trans, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hill310@sina.com,"Chen, Yanyan/R-2443-2019; chen, yanyan/AAR-7009-2020; Huang, Yuchen/HOH-2286-2023","chen, yanyan/0000-0001-5163-7181; Yao, Liya/0000-0002-0189-5016",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51308017]; Beijing Nova Program [Z141106001814110]; Science and Technology Program of Beijing [D161100005616001]; Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Institutions of Higher Learning under the Jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality; Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction in Science and Technology Project Plan [2015K5008],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Nova Program(Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission); Science and Technology Program of Beijing; Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Institutions of Higher Learning under the Jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality; Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction in Science and Technology Project Plan,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51308017), Beijing Nova Program (Grant No. Z141106001814110), Science and Technology Program of Beijing (Grant No. D161100005616001), Funding Project for Academic Human Resources Development in Institutions of Higher Learning under the Jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality and Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction in 2015 Science and Technology Project Plan (No. 2015K5008).",,27,108,129,27,293,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

I start by providing evidence showing that the risk attitude concepts do not play a major role in the axiomatic analysis of the classic models of decision-making under risk. This can be interpreted as reflecting the neutrality of these models between the possible risk attitudes. My central claim, however, is that such neutrality needs to be qualified and the axiomatic relevance of risk attitudes needs to be re-evaluated accordingly. Specifically, I highlight the importance of the conditional variation and the strengthening of risk attitudes, and I explain why they establish the axiomatic significance of the risk attitude concepts. I also present several questions for future research regarding the strengthening of risk attitudes.","[Baccelli, Jean] Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Ludwigstr 31, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Baccelli, J (通讯作者)，Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Ludwigstr 31, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",jean.baccelli@gmail.com,"Baccelli, Jean/AAF-8814-2020","Baccelli, Jean/0000-0003-0275-0377",Ecole Normale Superieure-Ulm; Universite Cergy-Pontoise; Wagemann Foundation,Ecole Normale Superieure-Ulm; Universite Cergy-Pontoise; Wagemann Foundation,"For helpful comments or discussions, I am thankful to two reviewers, Mohammed Abdellaoui, Richard Bradley, Michele Cohen, Mikael Cozic, Eric Danan, David Dillenberger, Louis Eeckhoudt, Raphael Giraud, Philippe Mongin, Pietro Ortoleva, and Fanyin Zheng.

A missing ingredient in the political economy of post-crisis financial reform is the neglect of questions of social purpose in both policy debate and IPE scholarship. Social purpose is defined as a vision of the desirable or good economic system, derived from combinations of economic analysis and ethical reasoning. It is of particular relevance and importance to macroprudential regime building, because the foundational macroprudential conceptual frameworks developed by the Bank for International Settlements and the Geneva Group from 2000 onwards display the features of a macrosocial ontology that draw on a Minsky-Keynes tradition. By focusing on systemic outcomes and collective social expectations, such an ontology creates the basis for so-called macro-moralities that provide ethical justifications for public forms of systemic stabilisation. However, a variety of epistemological, professional, institutional and political barriers have impeded relevant expert groups and political actors' willingness and ability to actively translate macroprudential ontology into a systemic vision, or sense of social purpose that could be communicated to the public at large.","[Baker, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Baker, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Polit Econ Res Inst, Fac Social Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Baker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Baker, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Polit Econ Res Inst, Fac Social Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,"Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-6677-930X",,,,,110,43,48,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The book was accused of unashamedly whitewashing the killing of animals and using the genre to influence children's moral intuitions. Picture books indeed come with an ageless tradition of conveying ethical messages. But it has been scarcely addressed so far how children make sense of pictures and narratives or by what processes they learn to respond to them. This is especially true with regard to normative messages concerned with nature in general and animals in specific. By reference to the AMA book as a case example I will identify ethically relevant elements of pictures and narrative. Their discussion will be set against the background of current empirical studies on anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism in picture books. The analysis will reveal the animal ethics potential of picture books which are 'usually more complicated and occasionally more potent than they seem at first glance.","[Benz-Schwarzburg, J.] Messerli Res Inst Vienna, Dept Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Benz-Schwarzburg, J (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst Vienna, Dept Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",judith.benz-schwarzburg@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,352,357,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_55,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000055,0

Modern medicine develops daily and offers new, better, more efficient and less unpleasant procedures for diagnosis and treatment. The development also influences on increased costs of healthcare. Healthcare providers at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels are scarcely paying and thus generate financial losses in the health sector. Public health financing in the Republic of Croatia is implemented according to the Bismarck model based on the principles of solidarity and reciprocity and is collected through compulsory contributions to health insurance paid to the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. Partial co-financing is collected through a complementary health insurance system. It is anticipated that the current gap between the available financial resources and the cost of health services will continue to increase in the future. In order to reduce the existing gap, one of the possible solutions is voluntary co-financing of higher-level of healthcare within the patient's own resources. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether patients treated at the Nasice County General Hospital are willing and interested to co-finance an additional - a higher level of healthcare than the one available from existing health insurance. The study was conducted on an example of 206 patients treated at the Nasice County General Hospital during January and February 2018. Survey questionnaires were set for 206 patients. According to the financial situation in the micro-region that gravitates to hospitals, the level of services provided by the hospital, the habits of patients (consumers), age etc., expected results of the research point at unconcerned co-financing of treatment by most of the patients.","[Bris Alic, Martina] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Harc, Martina] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci & Artist Work Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Vida, Dino] Gen Cty Hosp Nasice, Nashice, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts,"Bris Alic, M (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",mbris@efos.hr; harcm@hazu.hr; dino.vida@gmail.com,"Bris Alic, Martina/IWL-9109-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,2,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,172,183,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300010,0

Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of this test to improve the specification search in a spatial hedonic model, with an empirical application on housing prices in Madrid.","[Chasco, Coro] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Aplicada, Avda Francisco Tomas y Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Le Gallo, Julie] Agrosup Dijon, CESAER, DSHS Longelles, 26 Blvd Petitjean, F-21079 Dijon, France; [Lopez, Fernando A.] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Metodos Cuantitat & Informat, Fac Ciencias Empresa, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"López, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Metodos Cuantitat & Informat, Fac Ciencias Empresa, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain.",coro.chasco@uam.es; julie.le-gallo@agrosupdijon.fr; fernando.lopez@upct.es,"Lopez, Fernando A/J-3365-2012; hernandez, fernando/ISB-6242-2023; Chasco, Coro/L-2577-2013; Chasco, Coro/IUN-0313-2023; Le Gallo, Julie/F-9167-2018","Lopez, Fernando A/0000-0002-5397-9748; Chasco, Coro/0000-0001-8098-9979; Chasco, Coro/0000-0001-8098-9979; Le Gallo, Julie/0000-0002-7296-2415","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2015-65758-P]; Programa de Ayudas a Grupos de Excelencia de la Region de Murcia, Fundacion Seneca [19884-GERM-15]","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Programa de Ayudas a Grupos de Excelencia de la Region de Murcia, Fundacion Seneca(Fundacion Seneca)","This work was supported by Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (ECO2015-65758-P) and the project from Programa de Ayudas a Grupos de Excelencia de la Region de Murcia, Fundacion Seneca (#19884-GERM-15).

Promoting international trade in clean energy products (e.g. wind turbines, solar panels) can make an important contribution to this end through business and market expansion effects. If ratified, the landmark Paris COP21 Agreement will commit states to firmer climate actions, this necessarily requiring them to strengthen their promotion of clean energy technologies. Well over a hundred countries already have active policies in this area, many including industrial policy measures that impact on the international competitiveness of their clean energy sector. At the same time, governments have gradually liberalised their clean energy trade regimes, and large producers are negotiating an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). Clean energy trade is expanding and disputes among nations in this sector are growing. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) still has limited policy space' for climate action. Meanwhile, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) still had narrow and infrequent connections with trade matters. Moreover, WTO-UNFCCC engagement on trade-climate issues overall has been largely confined to information sharing and secretariat-level dialogue. This paper explores the extent to which clean energy trade is currently governed, where certain governance gaps and deficiencies exists, and argues why addressing them could help expand trade in clean energy products. It also contends that the most fundamental challenge for the future governance of clean energy trade concerns how to reconcile ramped-up interventionist climate action with an essentially liberal trade order.","[Dent, Christopher M.] Univ Leeds, East Asian Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Dent, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, East Asian Studies, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",c.m.dent@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,93,4,5,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

To anticipate the short-term effects of a distance-based tradable driving credit (TDC) scheme, an innovative stated adaptation experiment has been conducted. Using an activity-based approach, Dutch participants who frequently commute by car could reschedule their car-based activities and alter the travel pattern they reported in an online travel diary for a full week. This paper presents the results of model estimations that describe the likelihood of changing car use and the number of kilometres driven in response to two TDC scenarios. Reductions were larger for those who experienced a loss under the measure compared to those who could expect a gain. Participants who worked more hours and who lived in non-urban areas showed lower car use reduction levels, whereas participants with middle incomes and who were 18-25 years old showed higher reduction levels. A car dependency measure was added to the models to assess how these effects are related to the availability of car use alternatives.","[Dogterom, Nico; Ettema, Dick; Dijst, Martin] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Dogterom, N (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, POB 80-115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",N.J.Dogterom@uu.nl,"Dijst, Martin/ABF-5649-2021; Ettema, Dick/IQS-9627-2023","Dijst, Martin/0000-0002-7666-3455;",'The Application of Operations Research in Urban Transport' programme of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [435-12-212],'The Application of Operations Research in Urban Transport' programme of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research,This research was funded by 'The Application of Operations Research in Urban Transport' programme of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (grant 435-12-212).

However, political regime changes are often launched and developed overtime as side effects of moves made by political actors, and their outcomes are not predetermined. This article aims to go beyond this dismal consensus, and revisits some of the arguments on the role of structure and agency in post-Soviet regime dynamics. Apart from the changes in structural variables, it reconsiders the role of the incentives and choices of self-interested political actors, who are not always omnipotent and well-informed strategists. The overall dismal tendencies nevertheless leave some bias for hope in the analysis of regime dynamics in post-Soviet Eurasia and beyond.","[Gel'man, Vladimir] European Univ St Petersburg, Fac Polit Sci & Sociol, St Petersburg, Russia; [Gel'man, Vladimir] Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, Helsinki, Finland",European University at Saint Petersburg; University of Helsinki,"Gel'man, V (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, Fac Polit Sci & Sociol, St Petersburg, Russia.;Gel'man, V (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",vgelman@eu.spb.ru,"Gel'man, Vladimir/C-8084-2013","Gel'man, Vladimir/0000-0003-3935-3893",Academy of Finland [284664]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [284664] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This article is part of the Center of Excellence Choices of Russian Modernization, funded by the Academy of Finland (grant No. 284664).",,79,9,9,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

However, much less attention is paid to the impact of individual ad text elements on target customers. Semiotic analysis, combined with the experimental toolkit as part of the marketing research, makes it possible to highlight the impact of individual elements of the advertising text on customers rather than the impact of the ad as a whole, which is the common practice in pre-tests. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of advertising storyline in its perception by consumers. The impact of different ads about two brand cars on an experimental group has been tested. Differences in the impact of a storyline built with and without the use of humour over the liking of advertising and the intention to buy have been studied. Focus group discussions were used to identify the variables included in the quantitative research. The main part of the study uses a quasi-experiment and a questionnaire to obtain primary data of the experiment. Such data were processed by applying some statistical procedures like one-dimensional and two-dimensional distributions, variance analysis, chi-square test, correlation analysis. Semiotic analysis of the advertising text was applied. The results of the research show a connection between the use of humour in plotting, the impact of advertising and the intention to buy. The scale used can be applied in subsequent advertising surveys. The proposed combination of semiotic analysis and experimental methods used in this paper enables a deeper study of advertising content in terms of advertising impact efficiency. Results can expand also the understanding of the impact of ad text elements on users in both theoretical and practical future research.","[Ivanov, Svilen] Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Belgium",,"Ivanov, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Belgium.",,"Ivanov, Svilen/AAN-7801-2021","Ivanov, Svilen/0000-0003-4559-9056",,,,,38,0,0,1,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,258,269,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500024,0

Contemporary trade agreements, however, often reach beyond trade in the narrow sense. Consequently, factors unrelated to free trade may affect citizens' evaluations of these agreements. We propose a model of attitude formation toward specific trade agreements that includes the societal context as a constitutive feature. We expect salient aspects of an agreement to activate corresponding predispositions. Empirically, we compare how this contextual model and a standard model perform in explaining German citizens' attitudes toward free trade and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The results show that the standard model performs well in explaining public opinion on the principle of free trade but is less useful in explaining attitudes toward TTIP. The latter were driven by postures toward transatlantic cooperation, predispositions toward the role of interest groups in politics, and market regulation-aspects salient in German public discourse about TTIP. In sum, we find ample evidence for the need to differentiate between the two attitude objects and for our contextual model of attitude formation.","[Jungherr, Andreas] Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Constance, Germany; [Mader, Matthias; Schoen, Harald; Wuttke, Alexander] Univ Mannheim, Dept Polit Sci, Mannheim, Germany",University of Konstanz; University of Mannheim,"Jungherr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Constance, Germany.",andreas.jungherr@gmail.com,"Jungherr, Andreas/P-7958-2016; Wuttke, Alexander/U-8428-2017","Jungherr, Andreas/0000-0003-2598-2453; Wuttke, Alexander/0000-0002-9579-5357; Mader, Matthias/0000-0002-4593-2392",Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung; Arbeitgeberverband Gesamtmetall,Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung; Arbeitgeberverband Gesamtmetall,Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung; Arbeitgeberverband Gesamtmetall.,,81,29,31,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Seed size correlates to energy reserves, and therefore an evaluation of the relationship between seed size and seed quality is needed. This paper discusses variations in the seed sizes of sixteen UNPAD sweet corn lines to determine the relationship between seed size and seed quality. The sweet corn lines used in this study were classified into two groups by seed mass (weight). Seeds classified as small averaged between 8.0-10.6 g per 100 seeds in mass, and heavy seeds averaged between 11.5-13.7 g per 100 seeds. The results showed that seed moisture content and germination rate were significantly correlated to seed size, and there was a slight positive correlation between the seed germination rate and seed weight. We conclude that heavy seeds were of better quality than small seeds.","[Kadapi, Muhamad; Nuraini, Anne; Wahyudin, Agus; Lestari, Setiyo Anita] Univ Padjadjaran, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Prod, Sumedang, Indonesia",Universitas Padjadjaran,"Kadapi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padjadjaran, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Prod, Sumedang, Indonesia.",kadapi@unpad.ac.id; anne.nuraini@unpad.ac.id; agus.wahyudin@unpad.ac.id; anitasetiyo.sa@gmail.com,"Muhamad, Kadapi/AAU-4405-2021","Muhamad, Kadapi/0000-0002-0514-3751",,,,,40,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,122,125,,,,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800024,0

It argues that the absence of an ethnically stratified social structure in Kabardino-Balkaria is one of the reasons why this republic enjoyed relative intercommunal peace and stability in the 1990s and early 2000s. By contrast, the surrounding national republics of the North Caucasus that came out of the Soviet era with socio-economic disparities along ethnic lines witnessed higher levels of intercommunal conflict.

The so-called post-industrial trilemma is suggested to allow only two of relative earnings equality, high levels of employment and fiscal balance, and has resulted in the widespread policy belief that greater earnings inequality and welfare state retrenchment are unavoidable. This article challenges the micro foundations of this understanding, that the production of economic value is technologically determined by the physical properties inherent in goods and services. In contrast, we argue theoretically, and demonstrate empirically, that production, allocation and distribution are contingent processes better conceived in terms of power over rents' with associated externalities between sectors. Our analysis suggests that the post-industrial trilemma thesis may have unduly distracted research from the potential for redistributive politics to achieve sustainable levels of productivity growth, fiscal balance and higher levels of earnings equality.","[Lewis, Paul] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,116 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Peng, Fei] Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Songjiang Qu, Shanghai Shi, Peoples R China; [Ryner, Magnus] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London, England",University of Birmingham; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; University of London; King's College London,"Lewis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Univ House,116 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",p.c.lewis@bham.ac.uk,"Lewis, Paul/ACH-8124-2022; Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019","Lewis, Paul/0000-0002-1459-3981; Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Ryner, Magnus/0000-0002-7492-2986",ESRC seminar series award [ES/M002209/1]; LSE; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC seminar series award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); LSE; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank the ESRC seminar series award ES/M002209/1, 'Understanding the post-crisis landscape: assessing change in economic management, welfare, work and democracy' and the LSE hosted workshop, 'Wages in the EMU' for supporting the discussion of ideas which contributed to this paper.",,94,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Despite its importance, there has been a lack of applied research on the ethical challenges faced by veterinarians and to what extent they might affect their professional roles. In particular, little is known about reasons why veterinary professionals are subject to disciplinary complaints. This study aims to shed light on the nature of complaints against veterinarians in Portugal and on the disciplinary measures that have been taken. A retrospective investigation of the disciplinary processes within the archives of the Portuguese Veterinary Order (Ordem dos Medicos Veterinarios - OMV) was performed, using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. A total of 60 (out of 219) disciplinary processes, between 2012 and 2015, where analysed. Results show that complaints fall within nine categories of offence: (1) professional negligence; (2) failing to protect animal welfare; (3) certification misconduct; (4) advertising and promotions; (5) conflicting interests; (6) costs and payments; (7) lack of informed consent; (8) conflicting working relationships; (9) itinerant clinical practice. These areas highlight the plethora of ethical challenges faced by veterinarians in their daily work. Addressing these challenges and improving the standard of practice requires a combination of approaches, including life-long learning opportunities in both scientific and ethical decision-making. Gaps in governance have been identified, including the promotion of animal welfare, the responsible use of social media, advertising, mobile and distance medical services and effective communication. These findings seem to suggest that a revision of current veterinary regulations and ethical guidance in Portugal is warranted.","[Magalhaes-Sant'Ana, M.; Stilwell, G.; Peleteiro, M.

We evidence this contention via sectoral and geographic analyses while simultaneously showing that Irish fiscal policies have not redistributed gains from the recovery to the broader population. As a result, the economic recovery has been most actively felt by those in the FDI sectors, including workers from the EU and beyond. Building on theories from the study of comparative capitalism, we suggest that this experience indicates that Ireland's FDI-led growth model has created clear winners and losers, with significant distributional implications. The FDI growth regime been made possible by inward migration and European integration, but given the unequal distribution of the economic benefits that this generates, it is unlikely to be politically, or electorally, sustainable.","[Regan, Aidan; Brazys, Samuel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Regan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland.",aidan.regan@ucd.ie,,"Regan, Aidan/0000-0001-7558-730X; Brazys, Samuel/0000-0002-4482-4234",,,,,40,45,45,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Public debates in countries like Britain, Australia and the US have subsequently focused on the ostensible coming of age of generation rent', constituted of younger individuals excluded from home buying and traditional routes to housing asset accumulation. While the focus of this paper is the significance of access to housing assets as a means to offset potential economic and welfare precarity, our concern is landlords rather than tenants. Drawing on British survey data, we show that the rental boom has been accompanied by increasing multiple property ownership among classes of largely middle-aged and relatively affluent households. Over one-million small-time landlords have emerged in the last decade alone, who, we argue, are part product of historic developments in housing markets and welfare states. Generations of British have not only been orientated towards their homes as commodity assets, they have also begun to mobilise around multi-property accumulation in a context of shifting welfare and pension expectations.","[Ronald, Richard; Kadi, Justin] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Ctr Urban Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ronald, Richard] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Social Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Kadi, Justin] Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Inst European Urban Studies, Weimar, Germany",University of Amsterdam; University of Birmingham; Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar,"Ronald, R (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Ctr Urban Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Ronald, R (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Social Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",r.ronald@uva.nl,"Ronald, Richard/A-3412-2011","Ronald, Richard/0000-0003-3263-8204",European Research Council [StG Grant HOUWEL] [283881],European Research Council [StG Grant HOUWEL],"This research was supported through the European Research Council [StG Grant HOUWEL, No. 283881].",,82,81,82,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Purpose of the paper is to analyse and verify how productivity level in ICT sector impacts the economic competitiveness of different European countries. As measurement for competitiveness Global Competitiveness Index (rank and value) data from World Bank databank is used and is attributed to the apparent labour productivity in 1000 EUR for information and communication sector from Eurostat. Research results indicate statistically significant correlation between information and Communication (J) sector apparent labour productivity and Global Competitiveness Index (rank and value) data for year 2015. Additionally, a panel data investigation of Granger causality between ICT sector productivity, economic growth and competitiveness for EU countries is realized. As result there is found bidirectional Granger causality between ICT productivity and economic growth, ICT productivity and competitiveness level. Thereby could be stated that higher will be ICT sector productivity that higher will be the country's economic competitiveness.","[Rozite, Kristine; Balina, Signe; Freimane, Rita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Rozite, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,571,578,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500053,0

When evaluating these findings, no definite conclusion can be drawn on the question if wage dispersion is beneficial to team performance or not. Future research has to be done to shed more light on this field of research. The majority of the discussed papers use sports research settings to explain the effects of wage dispersion. In sports, performance statistics are published in detail, and the wages are often publicly disclosed. These circumstances found in sports datasets are beneficial for the research on the influences of wage dispersion. The presented literature is compared regarding their explanatory variables. This paper emphasizes on three issues for further investigations on the effects of wage dispersion on team performance. Different measures of wage dispersion, as well as the explained dispersion in pay and the possibility of non-linear effects, will be discussed.

The development of regional tourism products requires a special interdisciplinary approach in the field of development policy, its programming and planning, taking into account economic, spatial and administrative aspects. The aim of this study is to show the importance of access and verification of information in the development of regional products in tourism. An important aspect is to present the problem based on the opinion of entities that shape such products related to the development of tourism. Therefore, this study presents the results of a survey carried out among the creators of the tourist offer on the example of the city of Gdynia. The main objective of the study was an attempt of the respondents to assess access to information, information and the willingness to have market information at particular stages of the tourist product development of the area. It was assumed that the information chaos and the lack of a monitoring system and data presentation shows significant weaknesses in the harmonious development of the tourist function of the city. The results of the study clearly indicate the need to intensify activities for the acquisition and processing data that broadens knowledge about the market. This will significantly increase the quality of tourist products in Gdynia and increase the tourists' satisfaction.","[Wanagos, Marzena; Studzieniecki, Tomasz] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Wanagos, M (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",m.wanagos@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; t.studzieniecki@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908",,,,,21,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,262,268,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300031,0

Every translator can cooperate with all kinds of translators around the world through the translation platform. In order to adapt to this kind of work mode, the translator must have the ability to make use of all kinds of information technology and tools. The most important of these tools is the CAT (computer aided Translation) software.

Economics textbooks are perhaps the sole remaining medium to simply wish away their resulting relations of power. These are the teaching aids that inspire students analytically to think of markets as pristine economic institutions and persuade them politically that they should want to will such institutions into being. Yet they all-too-often rely on the pedagogical device of the so-called Robinson Crusoe Economy, where the main characters from Defoe's most famous novel are required to instinctively recognise their equality within voluntary contracting agreements so that each can act as the neoclassical homo economicus. In other words, economists' Crusoe and Friday figures must behave antithetically to what has historically been implied by the Crusoe' and Friday' signifiers. But how can this be so, given how commonplace it was when Defoe's characters were first introduced into economic theory in the 1850s to justify white settler colonialism on the grounds that savage' societies lacked the capacity to be self-governing? The raced market frame that emerged in practice from this assumption continues to be reproduced uncritically today by Crusoe's and Friday's presence in the textbook explanation of the most basic model of market exchange.","[Watson, Matthew] Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Watson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",matthew.g.watson@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship [ES/K010697/1]; ESRC [ES/K010697/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article was written with financial assistance from an Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship.

The paper firstly studies the short-term performance of the sample companies within one year after M&A and the long-term performance of two years after M&A. This paper finds that six aspects including the ratio of the largest shareholder shareholdings, the size of the board of directors, separation of the roles of the chairman and the general manager, management incentives ( management compensation and shareholdings), the ratio of institutional shareholdings have positive correlation with M&A performance. Meanwhile, the paper finds that three segmentation variables including the size of the board of directors, management shareholdings, and the ratio of institutional shareholdings also influence corporate M&A performance through capital liquidity. These results imply that capital mobility does play a mediating role between corporate governance and M&A performance.","[Xin, Shan; Xie, Hong] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xiafei] Hangzhou United Bank, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Xin, S (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,Soft Science Project of Zhejiang Province [2016C35041],Soft Science Project of Zhejiang Province,This article is a phased achievement of the Soft Science Project of Zhejiang Province (No. 2016C35041),,20,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-521-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,182.0,,,,,,759,765,,,,,,7,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5RA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465424800179,0

Yet BEVs, as a niche product seeking to disrupt an entrenched and established regime, face significant multi-level forces acting as barriers against such a transition, which the paper explores. This combination of factors creates a situation where BEV market penetration remains far below the level required for mass market transition. For BEVs to 'cross the chasm' and gain an established foothold in the market and hence significantly disrupt the regime, more holistic and effective solutions are required.

It is proved that transportation development can reduce transport costs, which is closely related to location factor endowments. As such, we believe that when analyse the economic impact of new means of transportation, both overall analysis and different line analysis should be taken into account. Therefore, the economic impact of high-speed rail were studied by DID and PSM-DID methods. The results show that China's high-speed rail construction has a positive effect on economic growth and will become an important force in reshaping the organization of China's spatial economy. However, the effect is different for different high-speed rail lines. Thus, Chinese government needs to fully consider the economic impact of high-speed rail. In addition, the government needs to formulate a high-speed rail economic belt plan in accordance with the characteristics of different rail lines. Furthermore, China needs to adjust its regional development strategy and regional policies accordingly, because the role of high-speed rail is mainly depends on whether a location has the necessary conditions to achieve the desired effect. Therefore, a city should adjust and recombine the local factor endowment to align with high-speed rail if it wants to capitalize on the new high-speed rail. Otherwise, the introduction of high-speed rail likely to adversely impact economic growth, which make the city a peripheral city.","[Jia, Shanming; Zhou, Chunyu; Qin, Chenglin] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Qin, CL (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",qinchlin@vip.sina.com,"LIU, YU/HTR-1607-2023",,"National Social Science Foundation of China [11, ZD159]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601111]; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation [2015A030310523]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research centre for the Industrial Development of Guangdong; Regional Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan","National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research centre for the Industrial Development of Guangdong; Regional Cooperation with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan","We are grateful to the editor, John Rose, and two anonymous referees for suggestions that have significantly improved the paper.

First, we show that the proportions of overweight and obese people in Indonesia increased rapidly during the time period covered and that poorer groups exhibited a larger annual excess weight growth rate than richer groups (7.49 percent vs. 3.01 percent). Second, by calculating the concentration index, we confirm that the prevalence of obesity affected increasingly poorer segments of Indonesian society. Consequently, the concentration index decreased during the study period, from 0.287 to 0.093. Finally, decomposing the change in the concentration index of excess weight from 2000 to 2014, we show that a large part of the change can be explained by a decrease in the elasticity of wealth and improved sanitary conditions in poorer households. Overall, obesity in Indonesia no longer affects purely the wealthier segments of the population but the entire socioeconomic spectrum. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a stated preference experiment, data from 695 commuter cyclists was compiled through a web-based survey and analyzed using a random utility approach to evaluate whether and to what extent cyclists are willing to trade-off air pollution exposure with other attributes such as roadway characteristics, bike facilities, and travel time. Mean and maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (in parts per billion or ppb), a common marker of traffic-related air pollution, were used as the attributes to represent the externality (ranging from 5 to 60 ppb). Empirical results indicate that travel time and traffic volume remain the most important attributes for commuter cyclists in their route decision. We also computed a unique marginal rate of substitution called Value of Clean Ride (VCR). For mean exposure, the VCR is: 0.72 min/ppb and for maximum exposure, the VCR is: 0.25 min/ppb (95% distribution: -0.16, 0.67). This essentially suggests that if an alternative route was available with an average nitrogen dioxide concentration that is lower by 5 ppb (a realistic goal in light of the high spatial variability in air pollution within urban areas), then cyclists would be willing to take it if it added no more than about 4 min to their travel time. We also observed that cyclists who received information on short-term impacts of traffic-related air pollution tended to be more concerned with avoiding maximum exposure.","[Anowar, Sabreena; Eluru, Naveen] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Hatzopoulou, Marianne] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; University of Toronto,"Anowar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",sabreena.anowar@ucf.edu; naveen.eluru@ucf.edu; marianne.hatzopoulou@utoronto.ca,"anowar, sabreena/L-4787-2019; Eluru, Naveen/B-2965-2012","anowar, sabreena/0000-0002-1915-9594; Eluru, Naveen/0000-0003-1221-4113",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under Collaborative Health Research Projects (CHRP),Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under Collaborative Health Research Projects (CHRP),"We would like to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who helped in disseminating the survey, particularly Professor Richard Tay, Keenan Dixon, Tyler Irving, and Junshi Xu.

While certainly industrial producers, consumers, and financial investors do have some influence on metal price development, the role of relevant price factors is not yet quite clear. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the explanatory power of various fundamental factors and characteristics known from financial markets, specifically on the expected returns in a unique data sample of 30 metals. We apply-to our knowledge for the first time in this context-the widely accepted method of characteristic-sorted portfolios, extended by the very recent method of two-way portfolio sorts as an alternative to classical multivariate regressions. This mostly nonparametric approach, combined with portfolio aggregation, provides very robust results. Our major finding is that the financial characteristics value and momentum have a very high predictive power for monthly returns of metal portfolios. Metal-specific fundamental factors like stocks, secondary production, apparent consumption, country concentration, mine production, or reserves perform depending on the interpretation moderately well or rather poorly, regarding some economically interpretable transformations and when using multivariate two-way sorts. Hence, from the perspective of expected returns, metals are predominantly assets, while fundamental metal-specific factors still play a non-negligible role. Thus, to a much lesser extent, metals can still be regarded as resources. Overall, the combination of financial characteristics and metal-specific fundamental factors yields the best results. With these robust results, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of metal prices and their underlying factors.","[Gleich, Benedikt; Mayer, Herbert G.; Stepanek, Christian; Rathgeber, Andreas W.] Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Finance Informat & Resource Management, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany; [Lutzenberger, Fabian] Univ Augsburg, Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg; University of Augsburg,"Rathgeber, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Finance Informat & Resource Management, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany.",andreas.rathgeber@mrm.uni-augsburg.de,,,"Bavarian Research Alliance (BayFOR) through the program ForChange; Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science, and the Arts","Bavarian Research Alliance (BayFOR) through the program ForChange; Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science, and the Arts","An early draft of this paper has been presented at the 22nd Annual Conference of the Multinational Finance Society (MFS) 2015 in Halkidiki (Greece).

Applying panel estimation models to Chinese provincial-level data for 1993-2008, we examine the impacts of China's coastal FDI and exports on its inland regions. We find that the coastal FDI has overall positive inter-regional impacts, while the coastal exports do not. Cooperative joint ventures generate positive impacts, but little for wholly foreign-funded enterprises and even negative for equity joint ventures. The inter-regional impacts do not exhibit any significance and robustness across exporters' ownership status. We attribute these counter-intuitive findings to the protectionist behaviours of state-owned enterprises in equity joint ventures and the prevalence of processing exports.","[Ouyang, Puman] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yao, Shunli] Inst Appl Int Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Ouyang, PM (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",,,"OUYANG, PUMAN/0000-0001-8446-7684",,,,,39,5,5,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2017,40.0,11,,,SI,,2403,2423,,10.1111/twec.12527,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FM3UR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414935100004,0

The policy of home purchase restrictions (HPR) has been one of China's harshest housing market interventions to squeeze out speculative demand and dampen the soaring home prices. Beijing was the first city to implement the HPR. Employing the regression discontinuity design technique, we find that Beijing's HPR policy triggered a 17-24 % decrease in resale price, a drop in the price-to-rent ratio of about a quarter of its mean value, and a deep (1/2 to 3/4) reduction in the transaction volume of the for-sale market, with no significant change in the rent or the transaction volume of rental units. In submarkets where housing supply was less elastic, the effects of the HPR were larger in price and smaller in quantity, suggesting that wealthy buyers likely benefited more from the HPR. The scope of the analysis does not allow conclusions regarding the persistence or longevity of these effects.","[Sun, Weizeng] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizeng; Zheng, Siqi] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizeng; Zheng, Siqi] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqi; Geltner, David M.] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Geltner, David M.] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wang, Rui] UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Public Policy Bldg,Box 951656, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wang, Rui] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Jinan University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University,"Wang, R (通讯作者)，UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, 3250 Public Policy Bldg,Box 951656, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Wang, R (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",sunweizeng@gmail.com; zhengsiqi@gmail.com; dgeltner@mit.edu; ruiwang@ucla.edu,"Deitsch, Haysha/C-2019-2017","Deitsch, Haysha/0000-0002-0215-4340; Wang, Rui/0000-0002-1126-9692","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273154, 71322307, 71533004]; national key research & development (R&D) plan of China [2016YFC0502804]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); national key research & development (R&D) plan of China,"We thank conference participants at the 2013 Asia-Pacific Real Estate Research Symposium held in Singapore for insightful discussions, Joseph Ooi, Seow Eng Ong, K.

Following Myers (1977) and Bernardo et al. (2007), we examine empirically REITs' unlevered betas, betas of growth options, betas of assets-in-place and the difference between the latter two in detail for 1983-2012, and also for three sequential, distinct, and mutually-exclusive REIT sub-periods. We find that, (i) the betas of growth options are larger than those of assets-in-place, (ii) there are differences in these betas across Equity REITs' sub-sectors and sub-periods, (iii) REITs with a high growth profile tend to employ more short-term debt and are mainly listed on NASDAQ, and (iv) the Global Financial Crisis has influenced considerably the beta estimates across all sub-sectors and REIT types. These findings raise a question mark about the 'income stock, only' description of REITs. Our findings have important implications for the cost of capital of REITs and their capital budgeting practices.

In the Brighton trial, three-quarters of those who were loaned an e-bike used them at least once a week. Across the sample as a whole, average usage was in the order of 1520 miles per week, and was accompanied by an overall reduction in car mileage of 20%. At the end of the trial, 38% participants expected to cycle more in the future, and at least 70% said that they would like to have an e-bike available for use in the future, and would cycle more if this was the case. This is consistent with the results of the European literature which shows that when e-bikes are made available, they get used; that a proportion of e-bike trips typically substitutes for car use; and that many people who take part in trials become interested in future e-bike use, or cycling more generally.

We particularly examine the nonlinearity in the stock market's reaction to the unemployment rate and study the effect at each individual point (quantile) of the stock return distribution. Using nonparametric Granger causality and quantile regression-based tests, we find that only anticipated unemployment rate has a strong impact on stock prices. Quantile regression analysis shows that the causal effects of anticipated unemployment rate on stock returns are usually heterogeneous across quantiles. For the quantile range 0.35, 0.80, an increase in the anticipated unemployment rate leads to an increase in stock market prices. For other quantiles, the impact is generally statistically insignificant. Thus, an increase in the anticipated unemployment rate is, in general, good news for stock prices. Finally, we offer a reasonable explanation for the reason, and manner in which, the unemployment rate affects stock market prices. Using the Fisher and Phillips curve equations, we show that a high unemployment rate is followed by monetary policy action of the Federal Reserve (Fed). When the unemployment rate is high, the Fed decreases the interest rate, which in turn increases the stock market prices.","[Gonzalo, Jesus] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain; [Taamouti, Abderrahim] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Durham University,"Taamouti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",abderrahim.taamouti@durham.ac.uk,"GONZALO, JESUS/C-3276-2011","GONZALO, JESUS/0000-0002-4309-5025; Taamouti, Abderrahim/0000-0002-1360-8803","Spanish MINECO [ECO2013-46395, ECO2016-78652]; Maria de Maeztu [MDM 2014-0431]; Bank of Spain (ER grant program); MadEco-CM [S2015/HUM-3444]",Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); Maria de Maeztu; Bank of Spain (ER grant program); MadEco-CM,"We thank the Editor-in-Chief Prof. Bruce Mizrach and two anonymous referees for their very useful comments.

Such predictions are often based on revealed preference (RP) data. However, this procedure will only yield reliable results in the absence of severe structural discontinuities. In order to overcome this potential limitation we used a situational stated preference (SP) survey to estimate the response to hypothetical fuel price changes beyond the scope of previous observations. We elicit fuel price elasticities for price increases up to four Euros per liter and find that the situational approach predicts the actual responses to previously observed fuel price changes very well. We conclude that applying a situational approach is particularly useful, if behavioral predictions for unprecedented (non monetary) policy interventions or supply side shocks are of interest that go beyond the reach of standard RP approaches.

It combines a data envelopment analysis to compute efficiency scores and regression analyses that deal with self-selectivity and endogeneity issues to examine the productive efficiency of farmers who benefited from the subsidy programme in the very atypical irrigated system of the Senegal River Valley. The results based on farm-level data indicate that the subsidy programme seems to be working, as it appears to be associated with increased efficiency; hence, providing empirical support to the political will to revamp subsidy programmes. The results also suggest various ways to improve the effectiveness of the subsidy programme in conjunction with additional policy options to further unlock the agricultural potentials of the region.","[Seck, Abdoulaye] Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, Dept Econ, Dakar, Senegal",University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar,"Seck, A (通讯作者)，Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, Dept Econ, Dakar, Senegal.",,,,African Growth and Development Policy Modeling Consortium (AGRODEP/IFPRI) under the Innovative Research Grants programme,African Growth and Development Policy Modeling Consortium (AGRODEP/IFPRI) under the Innovative Research Grants programme,This research work was carried out with financial and technical support from the African Growth and Development Policy Modeling Consortium (AGRODEP/IFPRI) under the Innovative Research Grants programme.

While scholars and practitioners share interest in intergovernmental collaboration, past studies have rarely questioned the role of civil society. Based on the social capital literature, a robust local civil society with high rates of volunteerism and civic engagement should facilitate local government cooperation. Using unique primary data from county governments across the United States, the authors question the degree to which local civil society influences collaborative behavior. The authors further contrast civil society's influence relative to that of private business interests. This study provides modest evidence for the role of civil society. Rather, the findings suggest that collaboration is greatest where business involvement in development is higher and public participation tends toward more token policies (i.e., citizen input mechanisms) rather than organized, citizen group involvement in decision making.","[Campbell, Joseph T.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lobao, Linda M.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Rural Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Betz, Michael R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Campbell, JT (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",campbell.844@osu.edu,"Betz, Michael/I-5430-2013",,,,,,66,4,6,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Although there are numerous pilot projects and test cases, many UCCs are granted only a short life because they fail to attract a sufficient number of customers. Evidence from literature shows that the cost-attractiveness of UCC solutions for their users plays a major importance in their decision to use these facilities. Indeed, since UCCs involve additional service costs for their customers, in order to be financially attractive, they must demonstrate their ability to decrease delivery costs further in the transport chain, through distance or time gains. Despite the significant interest of the practitioners and the research community in these facilities, there is a lack of knowledge and quantitative tools for assessing the costs of delivery operations and the potential savings by use of UCCs. In this paper, authors propose an analytical approach to estimating costs of deliveries with and without the UCC based on the description of the logistics behaviour of the urban stakeholders from the literature. The analytical framework is then applied to a case of a UCC servicing Brussels. The study shows that the main costs of deliveries are time-related costs and that the use of the UCC can indeed decrease them. The main elements that influence the cost attractiveness of the UCCs are the characteristics of a delivery operations (e.g. number of stops, average number of cargo units per stop or the type of actor who performs the delivery), the characteristics of the UCC (e.g. its location, the service price or the possibility of overnight deliveries) and the characteristics of the services area (e.g. size of the town or delivery density).

Using marine protected areas (MPAs) and the fraction of overexploited species as a proxy for marine ecosystem quality, we apply an autoregressive distributed lag model in a destination-origin panel setup. The empirical findings suggest that the presence of MPAs and the fraction of overexploited species have a considerable impact on inbound coastal tourism. Moreover, the impact of the overexploitation index on tourism is persistent and its short-term (current) impact constitutes 65% of the long-term impact. The results underscore the importance of marine ecosystem quality for inbound coastal tourism and its overall impact that may exceed the impact of tourists' income. We also find that government performance is crucial for inbound tourism.","[Otrachshenko, Vladimir] Univ Nova Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; [Otrachshenko, Vladimir] Ural Fed Univ, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Bosello, Francesco] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Lecce, Italy; [Bosello, Francesco] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Bosello, Francesco] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Ural Federal University; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Fondazione Mattei; University of Milan,"Otrachshenko, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Fac Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",vladotr@novasbe.pt,"Otrachshenko, Vladimir/HTN-3010-2023; Bosello, Francesco/ABE-6686-2020","Otrachshenko, Vladimir/0000-0002-2957-8741;","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0124/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0124/2013] Funding Source: FCT","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Vladimir Otrachshenko wishes to thank financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal (PEst-OE/EGE/UI0124/2013).",,61,12,13,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In line with the approach of Rauch and Trindade, we classify traded goods according to their quality level and separately estimate pro-trade elasticity of ethnic networks for each subgroup. We allow for heterogeneity of immigrants according to both the level of per capita income of their country of origin and their education level. Our findings suggest that the trend of the pro-trade effect of immigrants over quality seems to be driven by the North-South specialisation across varieties for both supply and demand. Indeed, ethnic networks mostly facilitate imports of those varieties for which their countries of origin have a comparative advantage; as for exports, ethnic networks are more effective in promoting exports to their homeland of those varieties for which there is relatively higher demand. We show that the same trend applies to products characterised by the same degree of differentiation according to the classification proposed by Rauch and - given their lower liquidity constraints and advantages in human capital - we find a greater impact of high-skilled migrants consistent across all quality levels.","[Giovannetti, Giorgia] Univ Firenze, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Giovannetti, Giorgia; Lanati, Mauro] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy",University of Florence; European University Institute,"Giovannetti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Firenze, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy.;Giovannetti, G (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy.",,,"Lanati, Mauro/0000-0001-9411-6845; giovannetti, giorgia/0000-0001-6322-2696",,,,,49,5,5,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2017,40.0,7,,,,,1345,1380,,10.1111/twec.12431,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FA2RN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405288600004,0

Yet, with the expansion of global regulatory co-ordination, the EU governance system increasingly interacts with policy-making in international regimes, which influences the internal dynamics of the EU's decision-making. This article seeks to refine the joint decision trap model by introducing global exit mechanisms and illustrating their empirical relevance for the case of accounting standards. The global exit builds on leveraging the outside benefits of global policy, the legitimacy of global standards, and new opportunities for locking in policy preferences through global commitments. Specifically, the accounting case demonstrates the Commission's strategy of harmonizing globally to harmonize internally' that produced an agreement after decades of stalemate. Moreover, it demonstrates how the global exit enables the Commission to protect internal harmonization despite the growing criticism and calls for the repatriation of regulatory sovereignty.","[Kudrna, Zdenek] Univ Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria; [Muller, Patrick] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU IKERBASQUE, Bilbao, Spain",Salzburg University; Basque Foundation for Science; University of Basque Country,"Kudrna, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Salzburg, Salzburg Ctr European Union Studies, Salzburg, Austria.",zdenek.kudrna@sbg.ac.at,,,,,,,74,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article focuses on two key explanations of the difficulties confronting older jobseekers: human capital theory, which focuses on the obsolescence of older workers' job skills, and ageism in employment. Drawing upon narrative interviews with older Australians, it critically engages with both these understandings. Using a Bourdieusian analysis, it shows how ageing intersects with the deployment of different forms of capital that are valued within particular labour market fields to shape older workers' 'employability'. By examining how class, gender and age intersect to structure experiences of marginalization, it questions conventional analyses that see older workers as discriminated against simply because they are older.","[Bowman, Dina] Brotherhood St Laurence, Res & Policy Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McGann, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Kimberley, Helen] Brotherhood St Laurence, Inclus Ageing, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Biggs, Simon] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Social Policy & Gerontol, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"McGann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",mmcgann@unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [LP120100624]; Jobs Australia; Brotherhood of St Laurence; Australian Research Council [LP120100624] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Jobs Australia; Brotherhood of St Laurence; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The research on which this article was based was funded by an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant (LP120100624), in partnership with Jobs Australia and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.",,58,36,40,5,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The hypothesis is that parents with a chronically sick or disabled child will have lower employment probabilities, lower labour earnings and higher sickness absence than parents with a healthy child, and that mothers are more affected than fathers when having a child with extra care needs. A quasi-experimental difference-in-difference regression model shows that the employment probabilities of parents with a sick or disabled child are comparable to those of parents with a healthy child, both for mothers and fathers.

Considering the impact of these factors, a stated preference survey approach is adopted to analyze household future preferences for gasoline, hybrid electric, and battery electric vehicles in a dynamic marketplace. The stated choice experiment places respondents in a nine-year hypothetical time window with dynamically changing attributes including vehicle purchasing price, fuel economy, recharging range, and fuel price. A web-based survey was performed during 2014 in the state of Maryland. The collected data include household social-demographics, primary vehicle characteristics, and vehicle purchasing preferences of 456 respondents during the year of 2014-2022. Mixed Multinomial logit (MMNL) models are employed to predict vehicle preferences based on households' socio-demographics and vehicle characteristics. The estimation results show that young people are more likely to buy vehicles with new technology, especially battery electric vehicles (BEV). Women with a high education level (bachelor degree or higher) prefer to choose hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) while men with a high education level are more likely to buy BEV. The estimated vehicle market elasticities with respect to vehicle price are from -1.1 to -1.8 for HEV and BEV, higher than those for gasoline vehicles from -0.6 to -1.0. The vehicle market cross-elasticities estimated by MMNL models range from 0.2 to 0.6. In addition, willingness to pay (WTP) of vehicle characteristics estimated by MMNL models provide a good understanding of household future vehicle preferences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical studies using Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis' methodology (an estimation of a two-way fixed effects (FE) model) do not provide clear evidence of the existence of assortative matching between workers and firms, that is, there is no clear evidence that good employees work in good firms. In fact, negative or very small correlations are found in the literature using this approach. Andrews, Gill, Shank, and Upward suggest that positive assortative matching has not been observed in the empirical literature because of a limited mobility bias. This article uses Italian soccer championship data to test positive assortative matching. Because job turnover is significantly high in professional soccer, we use numerous movers to detect sorting. Our results indicate that estimating a standard Mincerian wage equation with numerous movers enables us to find a positive correlation between players' and firms' FE, meaning that good players tend to move to good teams.

In the experiment, subjects choose to join one of two committees (weighted voting games) and obtain a payoff stochastically determined by a voting theory. We found that: (i) subjects learned to choose the committee that generates a higher expected payoff even without feedback about the payoffs they received; (ii) there was statistically significant evidence of meaningful learning (transfer of learning) only for the treatment with no payoff-related feedback.

At low frequencies, a decline in the growth rate of labor productivity appears to be behind the recent slowdown in GDP growth for both the United States and other advanced economies.

Puzzles are exciting elements in economics, because readers feel challenged by the question of how they can be solved. Among the puzzles analyzed by Deaton are: (1) Mortality increase of white, U.S. non-Hispanic men (2000 to today); (2) Why are height and income sometimes closely correlated, but not always?; (3) Height inequality among males and females; and (4) The Indian puzzle of declining consumption of calories during overall expenditure growth. This article reviews these puzzles and the main insights that Deaton derived from their discussion insofar as they pertain to the biological aspects of human development. I will focus on the field of this journal, Economics and Human Biology, in which Deaton has been very active over the last two decades. I will also document some of the responses by other scholars and their contributions to these puzzles, as they relate to the field of economics and human biology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that this rate of compensation typically is not optimal. A payment for distributed generation (w) that is below the retail price of electricity (r) often will induce the welfare-maximizing level of distributed generation (DG) when the fixed costs of centralized electricity production and the network management costs of accommodating intermittent solar DG are large, and when centralized generation and DG produce similar (pollution) externalities. w can optimally exceed r under alternative conditions. The optimal DG compensation policy varies considerably as industry conditions change. Furthermore, a requirement to equate w and r can reduce aggregate welfare substantially and can generate pronounced distributional effects.","[Brown, David P.] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada; [Sappington, David E.

The important finding that greater reductions in poverty were accompanied by greater increases in income inequality highlights the difficulty in addressing this trade-off from a tourism boost. Accompanying policies, such as investment to raise labour productivity in tourism-related sectors of hotels and restaurants, led to greater poverty reduction than a cash transfer policy. The cash transfer policy, on the other hand, reduced urban poverty but did not increase urban income inequality, unlike in the rural areas. Thus, there is no 'one size fits all' policy to address poverty and income inequality in rural and urban areas, and whether or not policies need to be targeted differently for touristic and non-touristic urban/rural regions is an area for future research.","[Mahadevan, Renuka] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Amir, Hidayat; Nugroho, Anda] Minist Finance, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Queensland; Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia,"Mahadevan, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.mahadevan@uq.edu.au,"Nugroho, Anda/AAV-7779-2021; Nugroho, Anda/JZD-4240-2024; Amir, Hidayat/R-8029-2018; Mahadevan, Renuka/AAA-1046-2019","Nugroho, Anda/0000-0002-7549-7619; Amir, Hidayat/0000-0002-9200-7466; Mahadevan, Renuka/0000-0003-4105-2993",,,,,51,48,52,6,80,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The first game has a unique (inefficient) equilibrium in mixed strategies, while the second game has two (efficient) equilibria in pure strategies and an infinite number of (inefficient) equilibria in mixed strategies. In both games, the optimal social costs can also be obtained via dominated strategies. We find that only in the second game subjects manage to reach an efficient outcome more often when matched in fixed pairs than when randomly rematched each round. Surprisingly, this is because subjects coordinate on dominated strategies (and not an efficient pure strategy equilibrium). We show theoretically that preferences for efficiency cannot explain our experimental results. Inequality aversion, on the other hand, cannot be rejected.","[Klijn, Flip] CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Klijn, Flip] Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Vorsatz, Marc] UNED, Dept Anal Econ 2, Paseo Senda del Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Klijn, F (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Econ Anal, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.;Klijn, F (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",flip.klijn@iae.csic.es; mvorsatz@cee.uned.es,"Klijn, Flip/K-4303-2017; Vorsatz, Marc/H-1489-2015","Klijn, Flip/0000-0001-7255-6954; Vorsatz, Marc/0000-0001-6244-3606","Generalitat de Catalunya [2014-SGR-1064]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica [ECO2014-59302-P]; Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]; Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-31985, ECO2015-65701-P]",Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica; Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD; Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We thank a referee for useful comments and suggestions.

However, transaction frequency varies over time, locations, and other factors. In contrast, two-thirds of homeowners have mortgages that they pay each month. This manuscript explores the use of mortgage payment data as an alternative or supplemental means to derive the value of housing characteristics. Insofar as price affects default and housing characteristic values determine price, housing characteristic values affect default. The implicit housing characteristic values come from parameter values that fit observed patterns of payments and defaults.

I look at the case of geographically homogeneous wages across regions with different productivity, and show that public employment generates a crowding out effect against private employment. This effect is larger the larger is the public sector share of total employment. However, when the government pays wages according to local productivity the crowing out effect vanishes. I present a two region two sector model based on Pissarides (2000) heterogeneous search and matching model where vacancies are posted by the private and the public sector as in Quadrini and Trigari (2007), Gomes (Forthcoming) and Boeing-Reicher et al. (2016). I calibrate the model to the Italian labor market and show that the uniform wage setting policy adopted by the central government, in the presence of productivity unbalance across regions, is responsible for up to 33% of the unemployment gap between the North and South. Moreover, I show that the geographical homogeneous wage setting is responsible for a stronger and geographically highly asymmetric response of unemployment to aggregate productivity shocks. I also allow for migration from one region to the other and find that it has only a very limited mitigating role in reducing this gap. Policy experiments suggest that reducing the size of public employment reduces unemployment in lower productive regions while allowing for regional wage setting in the public sector almost eliminates the unemployment differential.","[Caponi, Vincenzo] Univ Bretagne Loire, CREST ENSAI, IfW, IZA, Rennes, France; [Caponi, Vincenzo] CREST Ctr Rech Econ & Stat, Paris, France; [Caponi, Vincenzo] Univ Bretagne Loire, ENSAI, Rennes, France",Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI); Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI),"Caponi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Bretagne Loire, CREST ENSAI, IfW, IZA, Rennes, France.;Caponi, V (通讯作者)，CREST Ctr Rech Econ & Stat, Paris, France.;Caponi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Bretagne Loire, ENSAI, Rennes, France.",vincenzo.caponi@ensai.fr,,,,,,,22,12,13,2,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

The analysis will be carried out at a regional disaggregation level in Spain, and one hypothetical production function will be designed to link cultural resources and demand. We adopt a two-stage procedure to evaluate regional efficiency as cultural destinations: first, measuring performance by non-parametric methods; and second, analysing how other external variables might determine these efficiency ratios. In this case, we consider indicators representing reputation, accessibility, the omnivorous nature of cultural tourism as well as the scope to the regional cultural sector.

The direct effect of fiscal policy on the current account via aggregate (import) demand is potentially amplified by indirect effects, materialising through interest rate effects and intergenerational transfers that reduce savings. On the other hand, the implied positive relation between fiscal and external balances is potentially attenuated by offsetting changes in savings through Ricardian equivalence considerations. We expect this attenuation effect to be stronger in countries with more stringent fiscal rules and test this hypothesis using a panel of 73 countries over the period 1985-2012. As with previous studies, we find a positive effect of fiscal balances on the current account, supporting the twin deficit hypothesis. However, the effect of fiscal balances on the current account depends on the stringency of fiscal (budget balance or debt) rules in place; it is reduced by one-third on average and virtually eliminated for countries with the most stringent fiscal rules.","[Badinger, Harald; de Clairfontaine, Aurelien Fichet; Reuter, Wolf Heinrich] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Badinger, Harald] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Badinger, H (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.;Badinger, H (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",,,"Badinger, Harald/0000-0002-7238-5136",Austrian Central Bank (OeNB) [15469],Austrian Central Bank (OeNB),"Financial Support by the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB, Anniversary Fund, project number: 15469) is gratefully acknowledged.",,36,19,21,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2017,40.0,1,,,,,21,35,,10.1111/twec.12427,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EK5CJ,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393944200002,0

For this purpose, the authors of this chapter perform evaluation of the balance level of Russian regions' development in 2014, conduct analysis of causal connections of unbalanced development of Russian regions, and offer recommendations for solving this problem. Russia is the object for the research, as, in addition to the industrial orientation of economy due to geographical peculiarities, it is peculiar for high level of regionalization. Methodological tools include the proprietary methodology of evaluation of the balance level of region's development and the proprietary methodology of analysis of structural disproportions of regional development as a part of the national socioeconomic system. As a result of the research, the authors came to the conclusion that modern Russia is peculiar for the problem of unbalanced development of the regions. The most important condition for provision of well-balanced development of regions is innovative and investment activities. Thorough study of the specifics of innovative and investment activities of Russian regions led to the conclusion that the most important reason for its weak development is existence of institutional traps, under the influence of which the regions show low level of innovative and investment activities.

In the paper, the author analyses the extent of the research work done in the sphere of competitiveness of ports and deals with the main factors influencing the position of ports in the world market. Therefore, the purpose of the work is to highlight the major factors affecting the port competitiveness. The main research method is the theoretical research. The analysis is based on the research carried out by scientists in the field of competitiveness of ports. As a result, three main factors were identified and described. The most important factor affecting the competitiveness of the port is the development of port hinterlands. Development initiatives of these territories and the relations between them should be laid down in each port's development plan. Remaining factors are regular shipping lines existence and value added services in ports. Other factors that influence the overall port position on the market are also being reviewed.","[Blohins, Viktors] Baltic Int Acad, Riga, Latvia",,"Blohins, V (通讯作者)，Baltic Int Acad, Riga, Latvia.",,"yuhao, luo/HGC-3140-2022",,,,,,15,0,0,0,16,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,179,189,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2429,0.0,,,11,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200016,0

In doing so, I make two contributions. The first is empirical: documenting this exploratory campaign and mapping activist strategies and outcomes against the gold production network. The second is theoretical: evaluating whether the GPN toolkit can help explain how the nature of a commodity and its markets impact activist strategies and outcomes. Recasting industries as sites of social struggle, a GPN approach offers a more nuanced understanding of the power permeating markets than more conventional supply chain analyses. The results clarify the challenges activists face when politicising industries by targeting brands, particularly in the extractives sector. But the findings also illuminate opportunities, including the more subtle pathways of activist influence as they: (1) gather and disseminate information, (2) place social and environmental issues on the industry agenda, (3) spur industry to create institutions around these issues, (4) insert themselves and their agenda into the production network, and (5) form alliances with industry actors pushing for change.","[Bloomfield, Michael John] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Int Dev, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Bloomfield, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Int Dev, Bath, Avon, England.",m.j.bloomfield@bath.ac.uk,,"Bloomfield, Michael/0000-0002-3381-2756",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [752-2009-0713],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 752-2009-0713].,,68,14,16,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Although strongly related, the impact of architectural building styles on prices has not been studied yet. Using a cross-sectional hedonic price analysis including building styles of recently developed homes in the Netherlands we find a significant price premium for housing with neo-traditional architecture. Extensive intervention by local authorities on the supply side of the housing market seems the most probable explanation of this effect. The decreasing price premium over time reflects the impact of supply restrictions on price, but also indicates that style does matter.","[Buitelaar, Edwin; Schilder, Frans] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Amsterdam Sch Real Estate, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Buitelaar, E (通讯作者)，PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Amsterdam Sch Real Estate, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",edwin.buitelaar@pbl.nl; f.schilder@asre.nl,,,,,,,35,11,11,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,,2017,45.0,1,,,,,7,27,,10.1111/1540-6229.12137,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,EJ4KH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393185200001,0

In this paper, we thus propose a framework for Metropolitan Area Enterprise Architecture, which can not only coordinate different interests and objectives from the stakeholders by layered architectural design, but also provide an integrated guideline for future ICT development for Smart Cities.","[Helfert, Markus] Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland; [Ge, Mouzhi] Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, Brno, Czech Republic",Dublin City University; Masaryk University Brno,"Helfert, M (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland.",markus.helfert@dcu.ie; mouzhi.ge@muni.cz,,"Helfert, Markus/0000-0001-6546-6408",Science Foundation Ireland [13/RC/2094]; European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme,Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme,"This work was supported, in part, by Science Foundation Ireland grant 13/RC/2094 and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund through the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme to Lero - the Irish Software Research Centre (www.lero.ie).

In doing so, I highlight the importance of host country governments in the protection of labour rights: while private governance efforts have intensified in recent years, their success is conditional on local political actors' interests in the protection of workers' rights.

The process of education, in terms of financial literacy, starts at primary schools where children start to be exposed to financial literacy. It is followed by additional stages of education system. Moreover, this is completed by range of other possibilities how to become familiar with this type of knowledge, in the way of various programs, usually conducted by governments and other specialized institutions. Especially, in terms of universities behavioral finance start to play important role as well. Based on the previous assumptions, financial literacy needs to be tested, measured and evaluated, notably the level of students studying Economics, since their participation in economic world might affect the future of our society and welfare. The goal of this article is to verify whether there are some gaps among students and find out what are predictors standing behind various level of financial literacy. Consequently, additional target is to detect how financial literacy influences the sensitivity to behavioral biases and heuristics. This goal is reached by doing own research, which is based on an electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of three main parts. In the first part, respondents provide us with their demographic data, such as age, gender, education and other. The second one focuses on objective evaluation of respondent's knowledge of financial literacy. The last part examines behavioral finance, especially respondent's reaction to behavioral biases. The methods, used for the questionnaire evaluation, are descriptive statistics, enabling us to make a first assessment of the data file, and two-sample t-test, enabling compare different groups or samples. It also provides a chance to verify whether suffering from a particular bias corresponds with higher of lower level of financial literacy.","[Nesleha, Josef; Jancurova, Vera] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Nesleha, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Nesleha, Josef/AAB-6053-2021","Nesleha, Josef/0000-0001-5902-6289",Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0916/2015],Masaryk University,Support of Masaryk University within the project MUNI/A/0916/2015 Behavioral and knowledge aspects of trading and evaluation of financial assets is gratefully acknowledged.,,6,0,1,3,20,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,366,373,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.670,0.0,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200028,0

These efforts sought to revive a historic region called Novorossiya (New Russia) on the northern shores of the Black Sea that was created by Russian imperial colonizers. In public remarks, Vladimir Putin cited Novorossiya as a historic and contemporary home of a two-part interest group, ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, supposedly under threat in Ukraine. Anti-Maidan agitation in Ukraine gave way to outright secession in April 2014, as armed rebel groups established the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhans'k People's Republic on parts of the eponymous Ukrainian oblasts. Rebel leaders aspired to create a renewed Novorossiya that incorporated all of eastern and southern Ukraine from Kharkiv to Odesa oblasts. To examine the level of support for this secessionist imaginary in the targeted oblasts, our large scientific poll in December 2014 revealed the Novorossiya project had minority support, between 20 and 25% of the population. About half of the sample believed that the concept of Novorossiya was a  historical myth and that its resuscitation and promotion was the result of  Russian political technologies. Analysis of the responses by socio-demographic categories indicated that for ethnic Russians, residents of the oblasts of Kharkiv and Odesa, for older and poorer residents, and especially for those who retain a nostalgic positive opinion about the Soviet Union, the motivations and aims of the Novorossiya project had significant support.","[O'Loughlin, John] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Toal, Gerard] Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Natl Capital Reg, Alexandria, VA USA; [Kolosov, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow, Russia","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences","O'Loughlin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",johno@colorado.edu,"TOAL, GERARD/K-7925-2019",,RAPID from the US National Science Foundation [14-1442646],RAPID from the US National Science Foundation,This research was supported by a RAPID [grant 14-1442646] from the US National Science Foundation for the project Attitudes and Beliefs in the Russian-Supported 'de facto' States and in South-east Ukraine in the Wake of the Crimean Annexation.,,54,37,41,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

By this approach, the technical efficiency is examined sequentially with a certain window width (i.e. the number of years in a window) using a panel data of the Czech commercial banks. The Window Malmquist index is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models. We found that the average Window Malmquist index reaches the annual average growth of 5% in CCR and 3% in BCC models.

Most of them were placed under an excessive deficit procedure because of the deterioration of their fiscal positions; thus, they faced the necessity to conciliate the conflicting goals of financial consolidation and economic recovery. The bulk of new member states from Central and Eastern Europe have been no exception. In general, the latter are characterized by lower tax burden in comparison to EU-15, as well as with some differences in the tax techniques applied, especially in the field of personal income tax. This is result of the socio-economic circumstances during the transition to market economy and the need to improve international competitiveness. However, the global crisis added new challenges, such as fall in GDP, increased unemployment and deflation. The serious economic downfall required further lowering of tax burden with the aim to recuperate growth. On the other hand, the increasing public indebtedness required tax hikes in combination with reduction and streamlining of public expenditure. Against this background the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effects of the financial and economic crisis on tax policy of new EU Member States from Central and Eastern Europe and to summarize all important changes that took place in 2008-2016.

While the specifics of Cournot's partial equilibrium models were controversial, his analysis of the stability of duopoly drew the fiercest critiques due to the players' myopic behavior that ignores the information at hand. I contend this is a misreading. Cournot starts his analysis of markets by remarking that though producers cannot observe the demand curve, they can nevertheless maximize profits by trial and error: this anticipates Nash's adaptive interpretation of how equilibrium can be reached when players only know their own payoffs. Against the backdrop of this century-long debate, the originality of Nash's rational interpretation stands out: when players know the game, rational predictions (i.e., rational expectations) lead players to the unique equilibrium. More generally, Nash was remarkable in drawing attention to what the players know.","[Streb, Jorge M.] Univ Cema, Dept Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Streb, Jorge M.] Univ Cema, Dept Polit Sci, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Streb, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cema, Dept Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Streb, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cema, Dept Polit Sci, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jms@ucema.edu.ar,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,11,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The paper aims at analysing the approach applied to rural development in Poland and it answers the question whether the applied approach to rural development catalyses the catching-up processes. The study is based on the analysis of the visibility of rural areas in the Polish regional operational programmes and the instruments dedicated for them as well as on the assessment of rural development programmes (RDPs) in the programming periods 2007-2013 and 2014-2020. The results show that rural areas are hardly present in the regions' development policies. Moreover, there are no substantial differences among regions in the scale and character of including rural areas in the regional development programmes despite the diversity in the level of rural areas development and the extend of disparities between rural and urban areas. Due to insignificant presence of rural areas in ROPs, the key role in tackling the needs of rural areas is played by RDPs. Yet, as the RDPs are agriculture orientated and it only tackles part of the rural areas' developmental needs. Therefore, there is a need to change the approach towards rural areas in regional development policy by creating policy instruments that support the creating of links between rural and urban areas.","[Wieliczko, Barbara] Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Balice, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Wieliczko, B (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Balice, Poland.",Barbara.Wieliczko@ierigz.waw.pl,"Wieliczko, Barbara/AAG-7525-2021","Wieliczko, Barbara/0000-0003-3770-0409",,,,,36,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,381,389,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300038,0

Lacking opportunities to communicate exasperates the issue of isolation, which adds negatively to the experiences.

In addition, the study compares the general changes in trends in these Gini coefficients in terms of urbanization and the ratio of urban-to-rural average income by decomposing the Gini ratios. The results show that the Gini coefficient of flow income has an inverted U-shaped pattern, while the Gini coefficient of accumulated income decreases significantly in most years, showing a decreasing trend since China's economic reform and opening, with a time lag and fluctuation. Thus, either the accumulated or flow income Gini coefficients decline continuously as urbanization progresses, which could help governments craft fair policies to promote urbanization, narrowing the income gap between rural and urban areas.","[Ma, Xiao; Wang, Feiran; Chen, Jiandong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu 611170, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yang] Hunan Univ Commerce, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Hunan University of Technology & Business,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ Commerce, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhangyang_leo@163.com,"chen, jiandong/AAM-3236-2020","chen, jiandong/0000-0002-8279-5497","Program for the Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China [15AJY005]; Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China [14JZD031]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473203, 71171001, 71471001]; New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-12-0595]",Program for the Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China; Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"We appreciate the support of the Program for the Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China (No. 15AJY005), the Major Projects in Philosophy and Social Science Research of the Ministry of Education of China (No. 14JZD031), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71473203, 71171001, and 71471001), and the New Century Excellent Talents in University (No. NCET-12-0595).",,33,39,40,8,112,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This defiant stance entails a puzzle for rational-choice explanations that focus on expected economic utility: when SYRIZA came to power, the Greek economy had resumed modest growth, while its foreign creditors had extended debt maturities and hinted at the possibility of more debt restructuring in the future. Hence, there seemed no immediate need to force the issue. Furthermore, it appeared very likely that the incoming administration's demands would be rejected by some of the creditors, each of whom wielded effective veto power. In fact, weeks before the final showdown, George Tsebelis, a leading expert in the field of EU governance, had correctly predicted that Athens was set for a dramatic climb-down. This article argues that the Greek government's bargaining tactics were neither a rational answer to the country's economic predicament nor a necessary response to domestic constraints. Instead, moral emotions and status sentiments played a decisive role. The administration's overconfident defiance was strongly influenced by anger at Greece's alleged humiliation at the hand of its creditors.","[Wolf, Reinhard] Goethe Univ, Dept Polit Sci, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Wolf, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Dept Polit Sci, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",wolf@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Wolf, Reinhard/0000-0001-7867-4134",,,,,115,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

France followed a very common trajectory supporting the view that French economic performance was not as abnormal as the early literature maintained.","[Becuwe, Stephane; Blancheton, Bertrand] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Bordeaux, France; [Meissner, Christopher M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Meissner, Christopher M.] NBER, Cambridge, CA USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Becuwe, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Bordeaux, France.",stephane.becuwe@u-bordeaux.fr; bertrand.blancheton@u-bordeaux.fr; cmmeissner@ucdavis.edu,,,Maison des Sciences de l'Homme d'Aquitaine et Region Nouvelle Aquitaine,Maison des Sciences de l'Homme d'Aquitaine et Region Nouvelle Aquitaine,Research funding from the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme d'Aquitaine et Region Nouvelle Aquitaine under the research grant Ports et developpement des hinterlands.,,48,9,9,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

If he decides to stick to his initial demand, then the game ends and no one receives anything. If he decides to revise it down to 1 - x, where x is his initial demand, the revised demand is implemented with certainty. The implementation probability changes linearly between these two extreme cases. We derive a condition on the feasible set under which the two-stage game has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium. In this equilibrium, there is first-stage agreement on the egalitarian demands. We also study two n-player versions of the game. In either version, if the underlying bargaining problem is divide-the-dollar, then equal division is sustainable in a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if the number of players is at most four.","[Karagozoglu, Emin] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Karagozoglu, Emin] CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Rachmilevitch, Shiran] Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Ifo Institut; University of Haifa,"Rachmilevitch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Econ, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",shiranrach@econ.haifa.ac.il,"Karagözoğlu, Emin/R-7976-2019","Karagözoğlu, Emin/0000-0003-2442-6949",TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey),TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),The authors thank an anonymous referee for a helpful report.

The changes are largely driven by the emerging shared-mobility services and the travel behavior of the younger generations. This study builds on an investigation of Millennials', Gen Xers' and Baby Boomers' bike sharing ridership in New York City. This study examines station-level bike share use focusing on whether and how the effects of land-use and built environment vary across different population segments. Using New York's Citi Bike system data, we develop zero-inflated negative binominal models to estimate hourly trip productions at stations for five age cohorts: younger Millennials (born 1995 to 2000), mid Millennials (1989 to 1994), older Millennials (born 1979 to 1988), Generation Xers (born 1965 to 1978), and Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). Consistent with the literature, our results suggest that weather related variables, land-use and built environment characteristics have significant effects on the overall bike sharing usage. Our findings also reveal variations across age cohorts. For example, intersection density is positively related to younger Millennials' bike share trip production. However, this factor is not statistically significant for other age groups. Our findings provide valuable insights for planners and policy makers, and set the basis for improving the understanding of cohort differences in bike sharing demand.","[Wang, Kailai; Akar, Gulsah] Ohio State Univ, Knowlton Sch, City & Reg Planning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Chen, Yu-Jen] Tennessee Dept Transportat, Long Range Planning Div, Nashville, TN USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Akar, G (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Knowlton Sch, City & Reg Planning, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",wang.7684@osu.edu; akar.3@osu.edu; Yu-Jen.Chen@tn.gov,"Akar, Gulsah/HHS-7244-2022; Wang, Kailai/HKF-3153-2023; Akar, Gulsah/B-3716-2012","Wang, Kailai/0000-0002-5597-6823; Akar, Gulsah/0000-0003-4764-0913",,,,,78,121,134,12,95,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

It also analyses organisational and environmental factors that shape shippers' CSR beliefs. Survey data were obtained from 276 shippers with business offices located in Singapore, and analysed using multi-sampling approach and linear regression modelling. The results show that shippers with strong CSR beliefs derive greater satisfaction, and exhibit stronger behavioural intentions towards shipping firms' involvement in CSR. In addition, shippers' CSR beliefs are influenced by shippers' organisational characteristics such as (1) firm's age, (2) firm's size, (3) degree of internationalisation, (4) types of products shipped, and environmental factors such as (5) perceived environmental and social threats, (6) perceived level of competition, and (7) level of CSR practices in headquarters.

However, causal interpretation of estimates from previous studies, comparing participants to non-participants, is complicated by endogeneity and possible misreporting of participation in SNAP. In this paper, we take a novel approach to examine quasi-experimental variation in SNAP benefit amount on adult obesity. Children of SNAP households qualify for free in-school meals, thus freeing some additional benefits for the household. A greater proportion of school-age children eligible for free in-school meals proxies for an exogenous increase in the amount of SNAP benefits available per adult. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 we show that school meals represent a non-trivial part of the food budget for SNAP households. We find that increases in SNAP benefits have no effect on obesity levels for the full sample of those who report SNAP participation. To better isolate the effects of additional benefits from other potential changes we restrict our analysis to adults living in households with at least one child under 5 years of age. In this setting, we find that additional SNAP benefits reduce BMI and the probability of being obese for SNAP adults. Specifically, when one child in a household of four becomes school-aged, adult BMI is expected to decrease by 0.23 units and the probability of being obese decreases by 2.58 percentage points or by about 10%.

Gross farm income slightly increased over time with cyclical oscillations and an increase in the role of subsidies. Our estimations suggest that subsidies and off-farm income for non-LFA farms and farm specialisation for both LFA and non-LFA farms reduce farm income risk, whilst subsidies and farm size for LFA farms, and financial immobility for both LFA and non-LFA farms increase farm income risk.

The objective of this paper is to explore the impacts of the deep, 7-year economic crisis, on the perceptions of public transport users, with bus as their main transport mode, about service quality. Data from three user-satisfaction surveys that were conducted in Athens in 2008 (pre-crisis), 2013 (mid-crisis) and 2017 (deep-crisis) are used for the analysis. Mann Whitney/Wilcoxon test is applied for the distribution comparison of the responses between the pairs of consecutive years (2008-2013 and 2013-2017), in order to measure the change in users' preferences. Ordered logit models are developed for the user satisfaction and shift to public transportation after the beginning of the economic crisis. The results of the analysis indicate that the satisfaction about quality attributes, such as service frequency, conditions at the stations and information provision, are important contributors of the total satisfaction, verifying the results of Tyrinopoulos and Antoniou (2008) and Efthymiou et al. (2014), but their impact varies over time. Despite the general decrease of commuting activities due to increase of unemployment, the shift to public transportation has increased. More specifically, demographic characteristics, such as age, occupation and gender, as well as qualitative factors, such as overall quality of service, service production, transfer quality, ticket services and environmental consciousness, have affected the decision of people to shift to and from public transportation.","[Efthymiou, Dimitrios; Antoniou, Constantinos] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Chair Transportat Syst Engn, Arcissstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Tyrinopoulos, Yannis; Skaltsogianni, Eleana] Technol Educ Inst Athens, Dept Civil & Topog Geoinformat Engn, Fac Technol Applicat, Egaleo 12210, Greece",Technical University of Munich; University of West Attica,"Efthymiou, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Chair Transportat Syst Engn, Arcissstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",d.efthymiou@tum.de; c.antoniou@tum.de; yannist@teiath.gr; cw6476@teiath.gr,"Antoniou, Constantinos/K-4980-2019; Tyrinopoulos, Yannis/AAY-7846-2020","Antoniou, Constantinos/0000-0003-0203-9542; Efthymiou, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0979-4188",,,,,30,26,27,3,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Focusing on the functional pattern of American federalism, we suggest that increased federal welfare spending increases state government performance in the new economy development policy areas by helping states minimize welfare costs and divert more own-source resources into economic development. The central focus is on the direct and indirect empirical relationships between federal welfare spending and state new economy performance. The authors use an index of innovation capacity that reflects the cumulative performance of a myriad of overlapping and mutually dependent state policies intended to bring about new economy development; this index measures state new economy development performance by focusing on the observable outputs of such polices rather than the adoption, implementation, or substance of individual policy choices. Mediating variables, such as state fiscal comfort and administrative capacity, measure the indirect impact of federal welfare spending on state new economy performance. The authors find that federal welfare spending stimulates state new economy development directly, but also indirectly through its positive impact on both state fiscal comfort and administrative capacity. The findings suggest that federal intergovernmental transfers continue to be an important policy mechanism with spillover effects for state economies.","[Shin, Geiguen] Rutgers State Univ, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Hall, Jeremy L.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Shin, G (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs & Adm, 111 Washington St,CPS Room 319, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",geiguen@gmail.com,"Hall, Jeremy/X-6780-2019",,,,,,73,3,4,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Using a structural new economic geography approach, we find that these policies have shaped regional economic development and urbanization patterns across China in very different ways. The construction of the NEN has reinforced China's existing core-periphery patterns: initially lagging regions not connected to the NEN have not benefitted much from its construction. By contrast, a removal of the Hukou restrictions is predicted to result in much more widespread welfare gains, allowing all people to benefit by moving to where they are most productive. Interestingly, it would even promote urbanization in currently lagging (inland) regions, mostly by stimulating rural outmigration.","[Bosker, Maarten] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bosker, Maarten] CEPR, London, England; [Deichmann, Uwe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Roberts, Mark] World Bank, Social Urban Rural & Resilience Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Bosker, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bosker@ese.eur.nl; udeichmann@worldbank.org; mroberts1@worldbank.org,"Roberts, Mark/HSG-3436-2023",,World Banks Knowledge for Change Program,World Banks Knowledge for Change Program,"The authors thank the editor and three anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that significantly improved earlier versions of the paper.

Relocatee's travel mode choice and travel equity analysis in large-scale residential areas on the periphery of megacity Shanghai, China",TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Relocatee; Travel mode choice; Travel equity; Multinomial logit models for panel data; Consumer surplus; Large-scale residential areas on the megacity; Periphery,TRANSPORT; BEHAVIOR; REDEVELOPMENT; SATISFACTION; MOBILITY; POOR,"Residential displacement by urban regeneration in western economies and passive relocation in eastern countries have attracted the attention of researchers. Over the past decades, Chinese megacities have undergone massive passive relocation. They are reforming their old downtown areas and demolishing substandard housing. The government relocates residents to affordable city-peripheral large-scale residential areas. These residents are called relocatees. So far, few studies have explored relocatee and non-relocatee on travel-mode-choice preferences and travel equity in these types of areas with adequate resident samples. To fill this gap, this study conducts a survey in five peripheral large-scale residential areas in Shanghai, uses statistical analysis of individual demographic characteristics and transportation-related decisions of relocatees and non-relocatees, and estimates travel mode choice models for three different groups (relocatee, non-relocatee, and overall samples). Consumer surplus difference is calculated as a measurement of travel equity. Results show that compared to non-relocatees, relocatees are older, poorer, and have a higher mode share of bus and lower mode share of car. Non-relocatees' value of time ((sic)25.23 per hour) is greater than relocatees' ((sic)22.62 per hour). As for travel mode preferences, for relocatees, the males tend to choose motorcycle, moped or e-bike, then bicycle. For non-relocatees, the males tend to choose motorcycle and then car. Relocatee has a (sic)6.88 per person lower travel quality than non-relocatee. Megacity-periphery development and relocation process have a more negative effect on relocatee's travel than on other population, from a travel equity perspective. This study contributes to the literatures on travel behavior and equity in megacity peripheral areas in developing countries. The findings point to important implications for the peripheral area's policy.","[Guan, Jinping] MIT, AgeLab, 1 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Xu, Chengzhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS","Guan, JP (通讯作者)，MIT, AgeLab, 1 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",jinpingg@mit.edu,"XU, CHENGZHONG/AAX-1707-2020","XU, CHENGZHONG/0000-0001-9480-0356","Major Project of Chinese National Programs for Fundamental Research and Development [2015CB352400]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Planning Project [JSGG20150512145714248, GCZX20140508161906699]",Major Project of Chinese National Programs for Fundamental Research and Development; Shenzhen Science and Technology Planning Project,"The author thanks Joan Walker and Akshay ViJ of the University of California Berkeley, Dongyuan Yang and Xin Ye of the Tongji University for their suggestions and feedback.

Notably, I also find that these effects are interdependent, suggesting that the support for a local secession is affected to some degree by out-group aversion.

This paper contributes to this literature by proposing new tests to improve the power of the conventional threshold cointegration tests. The new tests intuitively resolve one of the possible reasons that attribute to the low power of existing threshold cointegration tests and are easy to implement since they do not require any additional information outside of the system. Our simulation results show that the proposed tests improve the power of the existing threshold cointegration tests, especially as the signal-to-noise ratio increases, in contrast to other considered procedures. The efficiency gains are achieved regardless of sample size, the number of cointegrated variables, and the types of threshold specifications. The newly developed tests are applied to examine long-run purchasing power parity in the Pacific nations. In contrast to conventional cointegration tests, the proposed tests found long-run PPP holds in 5 out of 7 countries with appropriate asymmetric adjustments.","[Oh, Dong-Yop; Lee, Hyejin] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Informat Syst, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Meng, Ming] Fifth Third Bank, Model Risk Management Dept, 38 Fountain Sq Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45263 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Informat Syst, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",dong.oh@utrgv.edu; hyejin.lee@utrgv.edu; ming.meng@53.com,,,,,,,21,2,2,1,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The paper organises the G20's efforts under five themes: macroeconomic stimulus, fiscal consolidation, monetary policy, the global financial safety net and global imbalances. The G20 was initially successful in each of these areas, but this success was short-lived. While the G20 met its goals on macroeconomic stimulus, it has been less successful in reducing deficits and debt. While it was successful in increasing its resources, the global financial safety net remains too small, too fragmented and institutional reform is incomplete. While the G20 succeeded in moving to more market-determined exchange rates and avoiding competitive devaluations, it struggled to avoid negative spillovers. Despite years of effort, the G20 has made limited progress in reducing global imbalances. Current account imbalances are creeping back to pre-crisis levels. Public debt remains high and most economies are moving in the wrong direction in correcting imbalances in household savings and debt. The paper concludes that the G20 has done better in some areas than others. But to suggest the G20 is a forum in decline ignores its shift from reactive crisis response to longer-term structural challenges outside of the pressing need of an immediate crisis.","[Triggs, Adam] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Triggs, Adam] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Brookings Institution; Australian National University,"Triggs, A (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Triggs, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,76,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1309,1341,,10.1111/twec.12607,0.0,,,33,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100008,0

The analysis considers grants allocated to firms in East German regions over the period 2007 to 2013 under the regional policy scheme Joint Task ` Improving Regional Economic Structures' (GRW).

For the assessment, we use administrative data from the Federal Statistical Office and the Offices of the Lander to demonstrate that this administrative database offers a huge potential for evidence-based policy advice. The results suggest that investment subsidies have a positive impact on different dimensions of firm development, but do not affect overall firm competitiveness. We find positive short-and medium-run effects on firm employment. The effects on firm turnover remain significant and positive only in the medium-run. Gross fixed capital formation responses positively to GRW funding only during the mean implementation period of the projects but becomes insignificant afterwards. Finally, the effect of GRW-funding on labour productivity remains insignificant throughout the whole period of analysis.","[Brachert, Matthias; Dettmann, Eva] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Dept Struct Change & Prod, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Titze, Mirko] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Ctr Evidence Based Policy Consulting, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Brachert, M (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Dept Struct Change & Prod, Halle, Saale, Germany.",Matthias.Brachert@iwh-halle.de; Eva.Dettmann@iwh-halle.de; Mirko.Titze@iwh-halle.de,"Brachert, Matthias/O-7743-2019",,,,,,35,10,12,1,37,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The paper ends by relating this index to the existing literature on distance between orderings, and also offers a practical application of the index.","[Checchi, Daniele; Verzillo, Stefano] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20138 Milan, Italy; [Checchi, Daniele] FBK Irvapp, Trento, Italy; [Checchi, Daniele] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [De Fraja, Gianni] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Sch Econ, Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [De Fraja, Gianni] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dipartimento Econ & Finanza, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [De Fraja, Gianni] CEPR, 90-98 Goswell St, London EC1V 7DB, England; [Verzillo, Stefano] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 361, Ispra, VA, Italy",University of Milan; Fondazione Bruno Kessler; FBK-IRVAPP - Research Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Nottingham; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Verzillo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dipartimento Econ, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20138 Milan, Italy.;Verzillo, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 361, Ispra, VA, Italy.",daniele.checchi@unimi.it; gianni.defraja@nottingham.ac.uk; stefano.verzillo@ec.europa.eu,"De Fraja, Gianni/F-6719-2015; Checchi, Daniele/AAL-7289-2020; Checchi, Daniele/AAN-2075-2020","Checchi, Daniele/0000-0001-7466-8562; VERZILLO, STEFANO/0000-0002-1895-8554",,,,,23,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2018,50.0,4,,,,,677,703,,10.1007/s00355-017-1101-5,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GA8QH,,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428604300005,0

The BS equation is a backward parabolic partial differential equation for financial option pricing and hedging. When we solve the BS equation numerically, we typically need an artificial far-field boundary condition such as the Dirichlet, Neumann, linearity, or partial differential equation boundary condition. However, in this paper, we propose an explicit finite difference scheme which does not use a far-field boundary condition to solve the BS equation numerically. The main idea of the proposed method is that we reduce one or two computational grid points and only compute the updated numerical solution on that new grid points at each time step. By using this approach, we do not need a boundary condition. This procedure works because option pricing and computation of the Greeks use the values at a couple of grid points neighboring an interesting spot. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new algorithm, we perform the numerical experiments such as pricing and computation of the Greeks of the vanilla call, cash-or-nothing, power, and powered options. The computational results show excellent agreement with analytical solutions.","[Jeong, Darae; Kim, Junseok] Korea Univ, Dept Math, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Yoo, Minhyun] Korea Univ, Dept Financial Engn, Seoul 136071, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Math, Seoul 136713, South Korea.",cfdkim@korea.ac.kr,"Kim, Junseok/AAH-5349-2019","Kim, Junseok/0000-0002-0484-9189",subproject of project Research for Applications of Mathematical Principles [C21501]; National Institute of Mathematics Sciences (NIMS),subproject of project Research for Applications of Mathematical Principles; National Institute of Mathematics Sciences (NIMS),The authors (D.

It is argued that bidders' ability to pay, taken as capital resources and/or capital budget constraints, influence bids and final auction prices. While high capital resource developers may elect to bid more than optimal to win auctions, or bidders may elect to pool resources in joint bidding, budget constraints imposed by firm-specific financial variables on the other hand are expected to restrict bids. Land auction data in Hong Kong are used to test systematically these predictions. It is found that a firm's age, the number of winners in a joint bid, and firm status in the market are positively related to prices, all factors which may be attributed to a firm's ability to finance the auction price. Firm size, internal funds, financing cost, debt capacity and existing capital expenditure are also shown to affect bids submitted in land auctions: firm size and internal funds are positively related to bid prices; while constrained debt capacity, financing cost and existing capital expenditure lower bids. The results are consistent with predictions that a firm's financial constraints, and thus its effect on capital budgets, are relevant factors in predicting land auction outcomes. More generally, these findings confirm that similar financial factors that constrain corporate capital investment also influence directly acquisition of assets at auctions.","[Shen, Jianfu] Hang Seng Management Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Pretorius, Frederik] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Real Estate & Construct, Pokfulam Rd, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chau, K.

In particular, the proposed approach combines an implicit/explicit operator splitting procedure with the harmonic differential quadrature scheme, and is so efficient that it can be applied to models with up to six stochastic factors. This is a remarkable advantage, as we can use two factors to describe the interest rate, other two factors to describe the default probability, and other two factors to take into account, for example, the so-called counterparty risk. The performances of the novel method are demonstrated by extensive simulation, in which various kinds of models with four and six fully correlated factors are considered.","[Andreoli, Alessandro; Pacelli, Graziella] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Management, Piazza Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo] Seconda Univ Napoli, Dipartimento Econ, Corso Gran Priorato di Malta, I-81043 Capua, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Pacelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Management, Piazza Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",alexander82@yahoo.com; lucavincenzo.ballestra@unina2.it; g.pacelli@univpm.it,"Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo/ABB-6093-2020","Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo/0000-0001-7205-6319",,,,,48,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Intrafirm prices may systematically deviate from arm's-length prices for two motives: pricing to market and tax avoidance. Using French firm-level data on arm's-length and intrafirm export prices, we find that the sensitivity of intrafirm prices to foreign taxes is reinforced once we control for pricing-to-market determinants. Most important, we find no evidence of tax avoidance if we disregard tax haven destinations. Tax avoidance through transfer pricing is economically sizable. The bulk of this loss is driven by the exports of 450 firms to ten tax havens.","[Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Martin, Julien] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Martin, Julien; Parenti, Mathieu] CEPR, Dublin, Ireland; [Parenti, Mathieu] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Toubal, Farid] Ecole Normale Super, Cachan, France; [Toubal, Farid] CREST, Dublin, Ireland; [Toubal, Farid] CEPII, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Trinity College Dublin; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Paris Saclay,"Davies, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021","Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256",,,,,48,102,111,6,83,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Catastrophe theory has, however, been criticized heavily for lacking micro-foundations and has mainly fallen out of use in economics and social sciences. The present paper proposes a simple catastrophe theory model of technological change with network externalities and reevaluates the value of such a model by adding an agent-based micro layer. To this end an agent-based variant of the model is proposed and investigated specifically with regard to the network structure among the agents. While the macro level of the model produces a classical cusp catastrophe-a result that is preserved in the agent-based form-it is found that the behavior of the model changes locally depending on the network structure, especially if networks with features that resemble social networks (low diameter, high clustering, power law distributed node degree) are considered. While the present work investigates merely an aspect out of a large possibility space, it encourages further research using agent-based catastrophe theory models especially of economic aspects to which catastrophe theory has previously successfully been applied; aspects such as technological and institutional change, economic crises, or industry structure.","[Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Hsch Ring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Hsch Ring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",torsten.heinrich@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,42,7,7,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The estimator employs a control function approach to account for endogenous selection and permits consistent estimation of scaled coefficients and relative effects.","[Semykina, Anastasia] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Wooldridge, Jeffrey M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Michigan State University,"Semykina, A (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",asemykina@fsu.edu,,"Semykina, Anastasia/0000-0001-7232-2971",,,,,32,19,23,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

In contrast to existing studies that rely upon time series methods, we employ a novel panel GARCH model that accounts for heterogeneity and interdependence across countries. Our main contribution is to shed new light on the inflation targeting credibility hypothesis based on lower inflation and inflation volatility as well as on the correlation between unanticipated inflation shocks within a panel GARCH framework. We find strong evidence of a reduction in the level of inflation that operates from the impact of actual inflation targets in the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand. We also find that the adoption of inflation targeting helped lower inflation volatility in the Philippines and South Korea. Overall, the results suggest that Asian inflation targeting regimes are more credible in terms of reducing the level of inflation than lowering inflation volatility. There is also evidence that the covariance of inflation shocks among inflation targeting and non-targeting countries tends to increase.","[Valera, Harold Glenn A.] IRRI, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines; [Valera, Harold Glenn A.; Holmes, Mark J.; Hassan, Gazi M.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of Waikato,"Valera, HGA (通讯作者)，IRRI, Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines.;Valera, HGA (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",h.valera@irri.org,"Valera, Harold Glenn/ABB-8603-2020; Hassan, Gazi/AAI-3282-2020; Holmes, Mark/A-4117-2010","Hassan, Gazi/0000-0003-3861-8191; Holmes, Mark/0000-0002-1771-9324",New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) [DEVSCH:PHL:8070],New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT),"We are grateful for the helpful comments made by the Editors and anonymous referees, participants at the 2015 meeting of the Singapore Economics Conference and to Jim Lee for computational assistance.

In this article, we focus upon the work being done in community gardens, using gardening in Glasgow as a case study. We argue that while community gardening cannot be divorced from more regressive underlying economic and social processes accompanying neoliberal austerity policies, it does provide space for important forms of work that address social needs and advance community empowerment. In developing this argument we use recent geographical scholarship concerning the generative role of place in bringing together individuals and communities in new collective forms of working. Community gardens are places that facilitate the recovery of individual agency, construction of new forms of knowledge and participation, and renewal of reflexive and proactive communities that provide broader lessons for building more progressive forms of work in cities.","[Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Reg Polit Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Shaw, Deirdre] Univ Glasgow, Mkt & Consumer Res, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Polit Econ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Crossan, John] Univ Strathclyde, Int Publ Policy Inst, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow; University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow,"Cumbers, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Andrew.cumbers@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Crossan, John/0000-0002-4449-1644",University of Glasgow; Glasgow City Council Knowledge Exchange Partnership Fund,University of Glasgow; Glasgow City Council Knowledge Exchange Partnership Fund,The authors wish to thank the University of Glasgow and Glasgow City Council Knowledge Exchange Partnership Fund for funding the research behind this article.,,41,51,58,3,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, in reality, there are instances in which sellers decide to accept an offer before the auction starts and cancel the auction. This paper first theoretically investigates the rationale behind this type of behavior and then empirically analyses evidence from real-world auctions. In particular, we suggest that, if some individuals are risk averse-in contrast to the standard auction theory models, in which all parties are risk neutral-then it is possible that accepting a price before the auction maximizes the expected revenue for the seller. Finally, with data on housing market auctions, we show evidence of such behavior and further investigate the implications of the theory.","[Khezr, Peyman] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Khezr, P (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.khezr@uq.edu.au,,"Khezr, Peyman/0000-0002-7559-6465",,,,,14,2,2,2,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

They also show that the cultural environment in which people grow up affects their preferences about redistribution. In this article we include these two components of the demand for redistribution in order to develop a mechanism for the cultural transmission of the concern for fairness. The preferences of the young are partially shaped through the observation and imitation of others' choices. More specifically, observing during childhood how adults have collectively failed to implement fair redistributive policies lowers the concern during adulthood for fairness or the moral cost of not supporting fair taxation. Based on this mechanism, the model exhibits a multiplicity of history-dependent stationary states that may account for the huge and persistent differences in redistribution observed between Europe and the United States. It also explains why immigrants from countries with a preference for greater redistribution continue to support higher redistribution in their destination country.","[Le Garrec, Gilles] OFCE Sci Po, 10 Pl Catalogne, F-75014 Paris, France",,"Le Garrec, G (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, 10 Pl Catalogne, F-75014 Paris, France.",gilles.legarrec@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,67,2,3,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2018,50.0,2,,,,,191,212,,10.1007/s00355-017-1080-6,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FT7LP,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423334300001,0

The analysis is based on the qualitative research carried out in November 2017 in a form of individual in-depth interviews (IDI) with seniors in different age groups (65-74; 75-84; 85+) for whom the old-age pension is a main source of income. Preliminary results have shown that seniors, despite of their age, tended to retire as soon as possible. Respondents aged 65-74 often indicated that during retirement they were continuing economic activity for a few years and some of them, who quickly retired and did not continue their work, expressed the opinion that from the perspective of time it was a wrong decision. Seniors in older ages (75+) reported disability or health problems as an important reason of early retirement and leaving the labour market (transition from disability pension to old-age pension was treated as a natural path). This factor was less visible in opinions of younger retires. Few of them pointed out that they retired as they wanted to take the advantage of a leisure time. A retrospective look at pension decisions indicated as the results of the conducted study may provide some interesting conclusions for public policies in the field of pension systems.","[Bielawska, Kamila] Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Dept Banking & Finance, Armii Krajowej 101, PL-81824 Sopot, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Bielawska, K (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Fac Management, Dept Banking & Finance, Armii Krajowej 101, PL-81824 Sopot, Poland.",kamila.bielawska@ug.edu.pl,"BIELAWSKA, KAMILA/A-4095-2019","BIELAWSKA, KAMILA/0000-0003-1558-0194","National Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2016/23/B/HS5/03768]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research was financed by the National Science Centre, Poland under the agreement No. UMO-2016/23/B/HS5/03768).",,16,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,39,43,,,,,,5,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800004,0

The Stockholm system was significantly extended in 2016, and the peak charge has been increased in the two cities. This paper analyses the effects of the first decade with the Swedish congestion charges, specifically effects of the system updates, and draws policy lessons for the years to come. Should we introduce congestion charges in more cities? Should we extend the systems that we have? We synthesize previous research findings and focus on the long-term effects that have varied over time including the recent years: the price elasticities on the traffic volume across the cordon, the revenue and system operating cost, the public and political support, and consequences for the transport planning process. We also explore the effects on peak and off-peak, and different types of traffic (trucks, company cars and private passenger cars), because of access to novel data that make this analysis possible. We find that the price elasticities have increased over time in Stockholm, but decreased in Gothenburg. We find that the public support increased in the two cities after their introduction until the systems were revised; since then, the public support has declined in both cities. We find that the price elasticity was substantially lower when the charging levels were increased, and when the Stockholm system was extended, than when the charges were first introduced, a likely reason being that the most price-sensitive traffic was already priced off-the road at the introduction.","[Borjesson, Maria; Kristoffersson, Ida] VTI Swedish Rd & Transport Res Inst, Linkoping, Sweden; [Borjesson, Maria] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",VTI; Royal Institute of Technology,"Börjesson, M (通讯作者)，VTI Swedish Rd & Transport Res Inst, Linkoping, Sweden.;Börjesson, M (通讯作者)，KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden.",maria.borjesson@vti.se,,,"VINNOVA, Sweden","VINNOVA, Sweden(Vinnova)","We are grateful to Karin Bjorldind, City of Gothenburg, Ake Wessman, Swedish Transport Administration, and Gunnar Soderholm, City of Stockholm, for support and help with data.

At the international level, an increaseing number of scholars agree that emerging technologies like AR have a promising future in various domains, from education to health, retail, urbanism or tourism. Recently, museums with international reputation have started to apply modern experiential marketing tools to enhance visitors' satisfaction. Even so, in this new transnational context, we still do not have a definite answer to the question of how modern technologies like AR could bridge the gap between local and global culture. We argue the answer lies in the propensity of young audiences to accept museums can be modern and innovative and become ambassadors of museums exhibitions, when these local institutions valorizing the past are willing to adapt to global technologies of the future. The plot of this project was triggered by the fact that, for the first time in Romania, a local museum (the memorial house of the family who wrote the national anthem) introduced AR technologies as an innovative solution to promote national heritage. We conducted a study to assess museum visitors' experiences, by applying a survey based on various marketing scales on a sample of 400 pupils and students after they visited a local museum exhibition with AR technologies. By running regression analyses, we evidenced the factors that predict both the tendency of pupils and students to recommend the museum exhibitions using AR technologies and to associate the museum with the attributes modern and innovative. We discuss the significance and challenges of these results for the field of experiential marketing and draw their implications for national and global economies in general, and management of tourism, in particular.","[Coman, Ecaterina Grajdieru; Rezeanu, Catalina-Ionela; Nechita, Florin; Coman, Claudiu] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Coman, EG (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",ecaterina.grajdieru@unitbv.ro; catalina.rezeanu@unitbv.ro; florin.nechita@unitbv.ro; claudiu.coman@unitbv.ro,"Nechita, Florin/B-4567-2019; Coman, Claudiu/AAL-3539-2021; Coman, Ecaterina/ABF-7363-2021; Rezeanu, Catalina-Ionela/Y-9979-2018","Nechita, Florin/0000-0002-5398-722X; Coman, Claudiu/0000-0001-6272-7414; Rezeanu, Catalina-Ionela/0000-0002-3085-5486",,,,,25,3,3,1,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,212,221,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300022,0

All these elements generate a rather rigorous path of litigation solving with a background of protecting the weaker side.","[Costea, Ioana Maria; Iluca, Despina-Martha] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Costea, IM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",ioana.costea@uaic.ro; despina.iluca@uaic.ro,"Costea, Ioana Maria/A-9209-2012; Costea, Ioana Maria/AAO-6416-2021","Costea, Ioana Maria/0000-0002-7787-4641;",,,,,3,0,0,0,0,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,365,374,,,,,,10,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700027,0

In particular, low educational power of the Slovak Institutes, high outflow of young and well-educated population, difficulties in starting new business. More specific factors which prevent eco-innovation development in the country include highly fragmented coordination work in promoting eco-friendly development, lack of funding for R&D, lack of market demand for eco-innovation, low level of public awareness on eco-innovation development issues.

Denes-Raj, Epstein [1994], Reyna, Brainerd [2008]). However, since it is usually impossible to know or to calculate probabilities of occurrence of various events, it seems plausible to claim that most decisions made in everyday life are decisions under uncertainty. That is why the aim of this article is to investigate people's perception of chances to win in a lottery under conditions of uncertainty when for the same price they obtain fewer or more tickets (with equal prices and number of tickets obtained for all participants). It is important to know if buying 1 ticket for 1 euro is as attractive as buying 10 tickets for the same price while the (unknown) probability of winning stays the same. The aim will be achieved by conducting an experiment with real but non-monetary pay-offs. Students will be given an opportunity to participate in a lottery in which one can win additional points to their final score in a subject. In Scenario I a student will be able to buy one lottery ticket for a small price, while in Scenario II 10 lottery tickets. In both scenarios the number of winning tickets will be the same. Along with ratio bias theory it is hypothesized that (with unchanged probability of winning) an increased number of tickets sold for a specified price will effect an increased demand for the tickets.","[Forlicz, Maria] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Engn & Econ, Dept Econ Sci, 118-120 Komandorska St, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Rolczynski, Tomasz] WSB Univ Wroclaw, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Econ, 29-31 Fabryczna St, PL-53609 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Forlicz, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Engn & Econ, Dept Econ Sci, 118-120 Komandorska St, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",maria.forlicz@ue.wroc.pl; tomasz.rolczynski@wsb.wroclaw.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,109,115,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800013,0

We apply an empirical multifactor asset pricing model with three-factor setting to capture the unexpected return and disentangle simple correlation due to fundamentals and contagion. We investigate four regions: the European Monetary Union (EMU), Asia-Pacific (AP), the Non-European Monetary Union (NEMU) and North America (NA). We define contagion as the excess correlation that is not explained by fundamental factors. Oil price risk is shown to be a factor as important as contagion.

We focus here on the most important members of their class, the lexicographic extension of preferences, and we define more precisely, the conditions under which these committees coincide when they exist. Our results depart from the rather optimistic conclusions of Kaymak and Sanver (Soc Choice Welf 20:477-494, 2003) on the coincidence between the CCG and the CCF. We exhibit profiles for which the CCF is empty while the CCG exists and the preferences are all of lexicographic type.

The results of this research are frequently contradictory. They may indicate the existence of the fallacy of composition. In the case of agriculture, it occurs when actions undertaken by the farmers to maximise their incomes bring opposite results to incomes analysed on a sectoral level. The aim of the paper is to examine in a systematic way whether this problem is real for agriculture in the European Union. Based on a literature review, a set of agricultural income determinants was established, as well as measure of that income. We constructed panel regression models based on a FADN (microeconomic) and EAA (sectoral) data. The results obtained indicate different sets of determinants of income on the farm and sector level. From the perspective of the individual farm, the intensification strategy proved to be effective despite higher dynamics of input prices than agricultural output prices, while in the sector as a whole, intensification growth has insignificant impact on income levels. In the case of specialisation, from the point of view of the whole sector, moderate specialisation may be optimal; in micro terms, either a high or low level of specialisation is more beneficial. Modernisation was a determinant of income in both sectoral and farm perspective. Overall our results indicate that the fallacy of composition exists also in the context of agricultural income.","[Kryszak, Lukasz; Staniszewski, Jakub] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kryszak, L (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",lukasz.kryszak@ue.poznan.pl; jakub.staniszewski@ue.poznan.pl,"Staniszewski, Jakub/AAU-1706-2021; Kryszak, Łukasz/AAF-2320-2019","Staniszewski, Jakub/0000-0001-8074-0911; Kryszak, Łukasz/0000-0001-8660-9236",National Science Centre in Poland [UMO-2016/23/N/HS4/03453],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The article was written under a project funded by the National Science Centre in Poland allocated on the basis of the decision: UMO-2016/23/N/HS4/03453.,,51,0,0,0,11,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,140,159,,10.14595/CP/01/010,0.0,,,20,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000010,0

Georg Simmels theory of economy as exchange brings consumers, producers and products together in comprehensive exchange scenarios and dynamics of objectification. Increasing desire for ethical products and use of labels are critically reviewed for their output of information and are located within a system of knowledge, trust and diverse stakeholder interests on food markets. The survey of these products also includes remarks on products having effects and showing agency in a frame of network-theory. In exchange these objects are brought together with subjects in a frame of new consumers awareness for diverse and conflicting perspectives on food-consumption. Postmodern and hybrid consumers are dependent on information, but also are overstrained tending to irrational choices. Referring to the proposal of subject-object interaction in exchange-scenarios already existing concepts for ethical market governance like consumer ethics and paternalistic (ethical) guidance by nudges are critically related to markets dynamics. Ethics for exchange of foods should take into account product-agency as well as consumers interests. It is proposed to turn to participative concepts like institutional governance, ethical matrix and focus on relational approaches.","[Leyk, W.] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen, Theol Dept, Eth Systemat Theol Eth 2, Kochstr 6, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Leyk, W (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen, Theol Dept, Eth Systemat Theol Eth 2, Kochstr 6, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",pfrwleyk@aol.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,3,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,163,167,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_24,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000024,0

This research used a qualitative approach (qualitative research) with a purposive method to explore and understand the meaning of poverty by a number of individuals or groups of people considered to come from social or humanitarian problems, and even still many other local wisdom activities that are very helpful for the poor, for example: Ciprotan, Lungkangan, Resik Desa, Tandur Panen, Genggongan (Tayuban), Ringgit (Wayangan), Sambatan, Bawonan, Bedah Bumi, the above activities produce values of mutual cooperation between the poor and capable people in their economic status, as well as the case, at the time of planting and harvesting, and when there are members of the village community building a house, it can be ascertained that the workforce is a member of the community and is not paid, but for consumption those who work from someone has an interest, in addition to cheaper costs, the house finishes faster.","[Mulyanto; Hidayat, Syarif Imam] Pembangunan Nas Univ UPN East Java, Fac Agr, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Rahayu, Endang Siti] Sebelas Maret Univ UNS Surakarta, Surakarta, Indonesia; [Supardi, Suprapti] Sebelas Maret Univ UNS Surakarta, Fac Agr, Surakarta, Indonesia",,"Mulyanto (通讯作者)，Pembangunan Nas Univ UPN East Java, Fac Agr, Surabaya, Indonesia.",mulyanto@upnjatim.ac.id; buendanguns@gmail.com; supraptisupardi@gmail.com; syarifimamhidayat@yahoo.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,93,97,,,,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800019,0

The efficiency of health care system is discussed topic in many articles and it is very difficult task to find the right methods according to which to measure health care efficiency. In our case for the comparing of the efficiency of health care systems we use nonparametric method, namely Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Two different output oriented models are used. The first one is with one output: life expectancy at birth and three inputs: health expenditures, total health and social employment and number of hospitals. The second one is with two outputs: all causes of deaths and infant mortality and three inputs like in the first model. All indicators are obtained from OECD database. Comparing results for these two models, that are very similar, show that both developing and developed countries can be effective.","[Pilyavskyy, Anatoliy] Lviv Univ Trade & Econ, Fac Int Econ Relat & Informat Technol, Dept Higher Math & Quantitat Methods, Tuhan Baranovskogo 10, UA-79005 Lvov, Ukraine; [Kopecka, Lucie] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Math & Quantitat Methods, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv University of Trade & Economics; University of Pardubice,"Pilyavskyy, A (通讯作者)，Lviv Univ Trade & Econ, Fac Int Econ Relat & Informat Technol, Dept Higher Math & Quantitat Methods, Tuhan Baranovskogo 10, UA-79005 Lvov, Ukraine.",apiliavs@mail.lviv.ua; lucie.kopecka1@student.upce.cz,,,University of Pardubice [SGS_2018_012],University of Pardubice,"This research could be performed due to the support of the University of Pardubice student project grant no.

As such, strategic planning enables growth and development through gaining competitive advantage. Recent literature provides insight into use of strategic planning principles in managing culture events, too. However, the findings are still scarce so with the wish to build on that body of knowledge, authors of this paper formulated their initial research question as: What are the benefits of strategic planning of culture events, primarily musical events.

In the empirical part of the paper we considered all major musical events in the city of Osijek and have finally chosen Osijek's musical wednesday as a representative event for our case study and SWOT analysis.

It uses four empirical cases to emphasize the domestic movers underlying Russia's eastward shift in energy trade, developing a constructivist theory rooted in the dynamics of Russia's dominant public narrative and the contours of domestic politics. It argues that Russia's national interests changed as a result of how Russian policy-makers interpreted and reacted to the stand-off with Europe, in response to what they perceived as Europe's attempt to isolate it economically and geopolitically. Russia's Eurasianists, who had advocated the notion of a necessary turn to the East for a long time, positioned themselves as norm entrepreneurs and their new interpretation of the preexisting material incentives shaped the future course of action.","[Skalamera, Morena] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Skalamera, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch Govt, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",morena_skalamera@hks.harvard.edu,"Skalamera, Morena/JHT-2499-2023","Skalamera, Morena/0000-0002-4806-6362",,,,,121,9,10,5,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Such institutions provide a testing based on questions prepared by the market regulator and supervisor - the Czech national bank. No one is allowed to provide or intermediate a consumer credit without a successful test pass at an accredited institution. We analyzed the test results of 287 employees of two medium-sized non-bank financial institutions who took the final qualification test at an accredited institution. The goal is to present the test results so far and to find whether gender and age are factors of the test score. We set four main and three auxiliary hypotheses regarding an effect of gender and age variable on the test performance. We find that neither of the variables is a factor. Although some level of variance is present in a more detailed analysis, it is not statistically significant. Therefore, we claim that regarding the test by the act no. 257/2016 Coll. on Consumer Credit the results are independent of age or gender of an employee. Our result was unexpected concerning the age variable. In a discussion, we explain that results might be biased by early-takers employees.

Agriculture is the cause of up to 70% of the projected loss of biodiversity, mainly due to the expansion of cropland into forests, grasslands and savannahs. In the European agricultural landscape, intensive agriculture with its dependencies on the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers is another main cause of biodiversity loss. Therefore, the agricultural sector is asked to develop management options towards a more sustainable production and consumption pattern as set down in SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and simultaneously to improve biodiversity indicators for SDG 15 (Life on Land). The Baseline Report of the EU Life-project `Biodiversity in standards and labels for the food sector' analysed current certification standards and pointed out several gaps concerning the protection of biodiversity. In sum, effectively reducing the negative impacts of food production on biodiversity remains a big challenge due to the complexity of the matter. Although there exists a global agreement on the definition of 'biodiversity' (sensu UN Convention on Biological Diversity), the application of operable bio diversity indicators and procedures for monitoring trends of these indicators are still lacking behind.

Therefore, this paper deals with determining the financial strategy in e-commerce. The main objective of paper is to identify the financial strategy of selected enterprises primarily focused on e-commerce. The research sample of enterprises involved to the survey is selected based on the following restrictive criteria: headquarter of enterprise in the Czech Republic, legal form of business joint stock company, existence of enterprise in e-commerce minimum 5 years, main business area B2C market, enterprises trading mostly electronically selling goods. The main research methods are following: analysis of financial statements of selected enterprises, selected methods of situational analysis and financial analysis and selected methods of descriptive statistics and financial strategy model simulating in Vensim program. Input data is used for the year 2016 compared to the year 2011, i.e. observing the development in 5 years. Findings identified the selected enterprises apply in most cases a conservative financial strategy (i.e. strategy of maximum liquidity). The conclusion of paper is based also on proposing the series of recommendations for effective creating and implementing financial strategy in e-commerce with a help of dynamic financial strategy model that could support the long-term competitive development of business in e-commerce. This model simulates changes of conservative financial strategy into aggressive financial strategy focusing on maximizing profitability during next 5 years, especially during the period of rapid economic growth and massive e-commerce development.","[Svatosova, Veronika; Chalupova, Sylva; Dvorakova, Petra] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svatosová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",veronika.svatosova@mendelu.cz; xchalup8@node.mendelu.cz; xdvora89@node.mendelu.cz,"Svatošová, Veronika/AAF-4918-2020","Svatošová, Veronika/0000-0002-5308-8822",IGA of Mendel University in Brno entitled The importance of strategy and strategic management of small and medium-sized enterprises primarily focused on e-commerce [FRRMS - IGA - 2018/003],IGA of Mendel University in Brno entitled The importance of strategy and strategic management of small and medium-sized enterprises primarily focused on e-commerce,This paper was prepared in the framework of the project IGA of Mendel University in Brno entitled The importance of strategy and strategic management of small and medium-sized enterprises primarily focused on e-commerce with the registration number FRRMS - IGA - 2018/003.,,20,0,1,0,8,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,715,724,,,,,,10,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800091,0

In this sense, companies seek to continuously improve the quality of service in order to manage keeping their costumers not only satisfied, but loyal as well. However, there is a great confusion regarding how this service quality can be measured thus that it can be enhanced trying to assure customer satisfaction. The service quality and performance of any service are dependent on customer expectations and on the efficiency of the company to serve its customers. The crucial point of customer satisfaction is to identify the important attributes, considered by customers, as their needs and expectations. The purpose of this study is to validate the adaptation of the SERVQUAL model for evaluating the perceived quality of service offered by traditional trade, namely of the traditional retail stores in Portugal. The findings of this study suggest that the 22 items of the SERVQUAL model can be grouped in three principals' dimensions and can be applied with confidence to Portuguese traditional retail as well. In addition, the model can be regarded as a useful tool for traditional retail stores to help to become better acquainted with each other and move towards the path of quality service, in a continuous search of the customer satisfaction and loyalty, translated into excellent organizational performance and higher profitability.","[Veloso, Claudia Miranda] Univ Aveiro, Inst Polytech Braganca, ESTGA, GOVCOPP,UNIAG, Aveiro, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Sandra Raquel] Polytech Inst Leiria, ESTG, CIC DIGITAL, Leiria, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Veloso, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Inst Polytech Braganca, ESTGA, GOVCOPP,UNIAG, Aveiro, Portugal.",claudiamiranda@ipb.pt; humberto@alumni.dmu.ac.uk; raquel.alves@ipleiria.pt,"Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/W-4239-2017; Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020","Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/0000-0001-6612-0580; Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540]; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was financially supported by the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy (project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540), funded by FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) - and by national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia & a Tecnologia.",,33,1,1,1,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,472,482,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300046,0

Due to changing technogenic and natural factors, the Passage building was constantly undergoing minor deformations. However, since 2009 the intensity of deformation of the building has increased. To study deformation processes, geodesic monitoring was organized to study the draft of the building. To quantify the sediment of the Passage building, a method of high-precision geometric leveling with the beams of the second class program with a precision electronic level Dini 12 and a bar-code strip was used. Analysis of the results of observations served as the basis for an objective identification of the alleged causes of sediment. The main cause of the deformations was the local soaking of the soil of the base of the building as a result of water leakage from the damaged (spoiled) water-bearing communications that pass from Deribasovskaya street through the entrance to the Passage. After the reconstruction of waterbearing communications, deformation processes ceased. This made it possible to give recommendations on eliminating these causes and ensuring the normal operation of the building in the future. During the reconstruction of the street Preobrazhenskaya in 2017, the road surface was lifted to a depth of 1-1.5 meter, and the work was carried out by heavy road machinery and jackhammers. At the same time, reinforced concrete was started to reinforce the foundations of the Passage interior, also with the use of jackhammers in conjunction with existing foundations. The appearance of new cracks is presumably a consequence of these vibrational processes. Recent observations of the sediments of the building, carried out in March 2018, found discrete subsidence of up to 12-30 mm for almost half a year. Simultaneously, the electronic total station Nivo measured the roll of the outer walls of the main facades of the building. Calculation of the rolls was carried out by the method of coordinates. Roll in the direction of. Preobrazhenskaya street reaches 311 mm.","[Yurkovsky, R. G.; Nakhmurov, O. N.; Shishkalova, N. Y.; Zakharchuk, V. V.; Kolomiets, N.

In order to prevent the aggravation of the environmental problems, to prevent a potential environmental damage and destruction ecosystem of the Dniester in particular, the public health, as well as the economic foundations, not only for the Republic of Moldova and the Ukraine, but for the whole Black Sea region, should consolidate the efforts of all interested structures and actors (including the non-governmental sector), to block the implementation of the Ukraine hydro power expanding program. Now, the Dniester cascade of hydro power plants have already led to negative consequences, but the future construction of another complex of six hydroelectric power stations will cause even more environmental problems. Additional six hydroelectric power stations have been planned for construction in the next 10 years according to Ukrainian Government Program of Hydropower Development until 2026. The lack of basin approach in the usage of aquatic resources of this transboundary river, as well as the noncompliance with provisions of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes can lead to an ecological catastrophe both for the Dniester River, Black Sea wetlands and Black Sea by itself. That's why in the decision making process about six hydro power plants, the states should achieve a harmonious combination of the three components of the concept of sustainable development (environmental, economic and social), which are closely intercconnected and only such a combination, would achieve the necessary balance in development. Taking into account the prevailing situation in the region, it is necessary to elaborate and adopt special convention on the Dniester based on a unified concept by the coastal states. Implementation of environmental policy of the states is not possible outside the context of the law-making process.","[Zamfir, Natalia; Zamfir, Pavel] Moldova State Univ, Kishinev, Moldova",Moldova State University,"Zamfir, N (通讯作者)，Moldova State Univ, Kishinev, Moldova.",nataly.zamfir@yahoo.com; pavel.zamfir@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,225,234,,,,,,10,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700016,0

This method is inexpensive and easy on subjects and has been applied to several desiderata that do not have revealed market prices. The CIV literature is, however, still limited in its application to health and thus information about its suitability is limited. With the aim of shedding light on the method's appropriateness we thus provide a broad-view analysis including a spectrum of diseases and conditions that can be held up against more traditionally used methods. CIV for physical conditions vary greatly, but paralysis, fibromyalgia, chronic back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, urinary incontinence, severe headache and thyroid disease were among those consistently associated with substantial wellbeing reductions. Mental-health results using this method should be read with caution. The societal value of health interventions is multidimensional, including for example increased productivity in the population. However, one of the main positive aspects of increased health is undoubtedly the increased well-being of the treated subjects. Such quality-of-life effects should thus preferably be taken into account. For this reason, information on the value individuals place on recovery from various suboptimal health conditions is useful when it comes to prioritizing scarce capital in the health sector. It is therefore vital to estimate the importance individuals place on various health states and hold them up against each other. Furthermore, this paper has scientific value as it sheds light on attributes of a potentially useful method in health evaluations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We specify and apply a repeat sales model with multiple stochastic log price trends having a hierarchical additive structure: One common log price trend and cluster specific log price trends in deviation from the common trend. Moreover, we assume that the error terms potentially have a heavy tailed (t) distribution to effectively deal with outliers. We apply the hierarchical repeat sales model on commercial properties in the Philadelphia/Baltimore region and on residential properties in a small part of Amsterdam. The results show that the hierarchical repeat sales model provides reliable indices on a very detailed level based on a small number of observations. The estimated degrees of freedom for the t-distribution is small, largely rejecting the commonly made assumption of normality of the error term.","[Francke, Marc K.] Amsterdam Business Sch, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1081 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Francke, Marc K.] Ortec Finance, Naritaweg 51, NL-1043 BP Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van de Minne, Alex] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 105 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University of Amsterdam; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Francke, MK (通讯作者)，Amsterdam Business Sch, Plantage Muidergracht 12, NL-1081 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Francke, MK (通讯作者)，Ortec Finance, Naritaweg 51, NL-1043 BP Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.k.francke@uva.nl; avdminne@mit.edu,,,,,,,37,14,14,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Meanwhile, transferability models have emerged to reduce the associated cost and computational burden, but haven't discounted the disaggregation level. This research proposes the proof of the concept of an innovative transferability modelling framework to estimate total number of trips and trip attributes in a tour of trips at a disaggregate level. In contrast to tour-based or activity-based models, the focus of transferability models is on replicating trip patterns rather than reflecting travellers' behaviour. Similar to previous transferability models, classifying decision tree is utilized as one of the modelling techniques in this study. Moreover, the merits of a modified version of decision tree and the random forest methods are examined. Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) in 2007 and 2009 are utilized to calibrate and validate the proposed framework, respectively. According to the results, the random forest method shows highest individual-level accuracy while matching the system-level observed distributions.","[Ghasri, Milad; Rashidi, Taha Hossein; Waller, S.

Meanwhile, lots of people belonging to different sectors of society flocked to city to search for jobs and better living each year. Therefore, for the government departments, one of most important issues is to determine the optimal toll of new highway under the background of ever-increasing households. This paper proposes an optimal toll model in the equilibrium framework of heterogeneous households' residential location choice. It is formulated as a bi-level program. In the upper-level subprogram, government departments determine an optimal toll of new highway in order to minimize urban system's total travel time. However, the construction and toll charge of the new highway will totally change urban traffic condition, and thus under the assumption of a complete market economy it will further affect the new households' location and commute behavior. Here, new households' location choice behavior has been modeled based on reference-dependent theory and household balance model. And their route choice behavior has been formulated as the multi-class multi-criteria stochastic user equilibrium model. This combined residential location choice and traffic assignment problem has been formulated by fixed point theory as the lower-level program. Finally, a genetic algorithm based solution approach is used to solve this optimization problem. In addition, a set of numerical experiments has been conducted to demonstrate the properties of this problem and the performance of our proposed model. And some interesting conclusions have been given.","[Li, Tongfei; Sun, Huijun; Wu, Jianjun] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Li, Tongfei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore; [Ge, Ying-en] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; National University of Singapore; Shanghai Maritime University,"Sun, HJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",hjsun1@bjtu.edu.cn,"Wu, Jianzhong/I-5164-2013; LI, TONGFEI/JSK-8228-2023; Li, Tongfei/ABQ-4552-2022; Ge, Ying-En/C-1123-2016","Li, Tongfei/0000-0001-5520-0921; Ge, Ying-En/0000-0002-8435-0483",China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists [71525002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71621001]; China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201607090026]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017YJS118],China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Prof. Wu was supported by the China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists (71525002).

The results show that being HIV positive reduces the probability of being employed by 5 percentage points among males in Uganda. The effect is greater for individuals employed in manual labor than non-manual labor. When limiting the sample to mainly individuals employed in subsistence agriculture, we find a 4 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of employment, suggesting that the effect occurs primarily through reductions in labor supply as opposed to demand. This is supported by additional analysis using univariate probit regressions to assess the association between different levels of HIV illness (as measured by CD4 cell count) and the likelihood of employment. The magnitude of the association increases as CD4 cell count decreases. Having a CD4 cell count of 200 per mm(3) or below is associated with a 9 percentage point reduction in employment compared to individuals with CD4 cell counts above 200 per mm(3).

Economists have carefully studied sources of bias in structural and quasi-experimental approaches, but the randomized control trial (RCT) has only begun to receive such scrutiny. In this paper, we argue that several lessons from medicine, derived from analysis of thousands of RCTs establishing a clear link between certain practices and biased estimates, can be used to reduce the risk of bias in economics RCTs. We identify the subset of these lessons applicable to economics and use them to assess risk of bias in estimates from economics RCTs published between 2001 and 2011. In comparison to medical studies, we find most economics studies do not report important details on study design necessary to assess risk of bias. Many report practices that suggest risk of bias, though this does not necessarily mean bias resulted. We conclude with suggestions on how to remedy these issues.","[Eble, Alex] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Econ & Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Boone, Peter] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, Effect Intervent, London, England; [Elbourne, Diana] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Healthcare Evaluat, London, England",Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Eble, A (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Econ & Educ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",eble@tc.columbia.edu; pb@effint.org; diana.elbourne@lshtm.ac.uk,"Eble, Alex/AAX-9203-2021","Eble, Alex/0000-0002-1273-5886",Effective Intervention; US National Science Foundation through a Graduate Research Fellowship; IGERT Traineeship; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Effective Intervention; US National Science Foundation through a Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); IGERT Traineeship; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper was previously circulated under the title Risk and Evidence of Bias in Randomized Controlled Trials in Economics.

This article analyses the impact of day labour worker centres on employment outcomes experienced in the informal day labour economy of the United States. Using data from the National Day Labour Survey, findings indicate that these organizations improve working conditions for day labourers and suggest the potential for SEOs to regulate employment processes within the informal economy. However increasing the regulatory capacity of SEOs will require addressing larger political and socioeconomic contexts in which the informal economy is embedded.","[Visser, M.

Some aspects of residential preference might be constant over time, inherited from the initial stage of life, and other parts might be responses to residential biography or other biographical domains like household structure, employment/education, and travel. Capturing these intertemporal dependences needs a life course analysis of residential location choices. However, a serious methodological gap exists between the perceived importance of dynamic life course analyses and quantitative modeling approaches. This study developed a dynamic choice model with cross-sectional and longitudinal heterogeneities as well as discounted utility (called the DU-DCLH model) to describe the decision-making process for residential relocation by incorporating various intertemporal dependences over the life course. Model parameters were estimated using data collected from a life history survey conducted in Japan in 2010. The estimation results firstly confirm the effectiveness of the DU-DCLH model for portraying the dynamics of residential mobility over a life course. Next, it was found that previous experiences dominate decisions on residential location choice and can explain more than 75% of the total variations in choice. It was also revealed that as the mobility age increases, the influence of the past on their choices increases continuously. In contrast, the influence of the present situation is small and almost negligible. Furthermore, the study empirically confirmed not only the influence of time-constant and time-varying preference for residential neighborhoods but also the specific influence of household biography, employment/education biography, and travel biography. This study enriches the existing research by providing a systematic modeling framework incorporating broader behavioral mechanisms for residential location choice over the life course.

The life-oriented approach focuses on the interdependencies between life choices, and for travel behavior analysis, it not only considers travel behavior as the results from various life choices, but also the reverse relationship of travel behavior influencing life choices. Here, first, we introduce the life-oriented approach in general, and then apply it to travel behavior research. Second, we summarize the findings from ten papers included in this special issue. These ten papers deal with topics such as commuting, 'peak car' phenomenon, travel mode choice, residential biography, holiday travel behavior, and happiness. Evidence is presented mainly from developed countries, but with an exception from China. Each paper presents unique and innovative efforts.

We show that occupational tasks changes display an extremely consistent relationship with participation to service exports: in sectors in which the importance of face-to-face communication with customers has increased, the firm-level likelihood of entering export markets has decreased; instead, the likelihood of exporting increased in sectors in which the sophistication of production and delivery has expanded (following an increase in cognitive tasks). Moreover, our analysis suggests that the change in IT use per se does not strike as being a key underlying force behind the increase in the extensive margin of service exports.

Evidence from African Countries,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; FIRMS; PERFORMANCE; SPILLOVERS; TECHNOLOGY; COLOMBIA; FDI,"This paper empirically examines the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows on exports in Africa. Using the system-generalised method of moments estimator for linear dynamic panel data on a sample of 53 African countries and five-year periods from 1970 to 2009, the paper finds that higher FDI inflows are positively and significantly linked with higher exports of goods and services. A large part of the FDI effect is driven by its spillover effects on exports. The paper also finds the lagged value of exports, a competitive currency, as well as increases in domestic investment and physical infrastructure, to be factors stimulating African exports.","[Mijiyawa, Abdoul G.] World Bank, Conakry, Guinea",,"Mijiyawa, AG (通讯作者)，World Bank, Conakry, Guinea.",,,,,,,,47,14,15,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1934,1957,,10.1111/twec.12465,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900010,0

Under existing housing market conditions in Detroit, demolition costs exceed the present value of additional property tax revenues resulting from demolitions over 50 years.

Some studies claim this is due to Europe's high taxes and that Europeans would gain by adopting US tax rates and work time. I argue that Americans would gain by reducing work time to Europe's level. Due to historical experience, Europe is able to internalise work-time-related negative externalities by enacting restrictive work-time policies, while the United States is not, resulting in a prisoner's dilemma equilibrium and overworking trap. A simple model and work-time data are used to derive the US welfare gain from reducing work time to Europe's level. Findings are as follows: (i) parameter values are consistent with experimental results on own vs. other people's income value; (ii) the welfare gain's present value is between 80 and 120% of annual welfare; and (iii) a European policy that reduces work time excessively remains beneficial if the reduction is less than twice the optimal one.","[Schiff, Maurice] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Schiff, M (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1708,1717,,10.1111/twec.12493,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900001,0

The IHD approximately doubles these estimated peak kWh reductions.

This study combines quantitative event history analysis and qualitative interview methods to try to understand why states adopted film incentive programs and how they were influenced by the adoption of incentives in other states. The analysis suggests that the diffusion processes in state adoptions of film incentives can be largely explained by two factors: (a) the size and sophistication of the existing film industry in the state and (b) a competitive bandwagon effect based on the total number of states that had already adopted film incentives. The results emphasize the need to broaden the ways that competitive influences can be conceptualized and modeled in policy diffusion research, especially in economic development.","[Leiser, Stephanie] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, 735 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Leiser, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, 735 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",schmidts@umich.edu,,,,,,,42,11,12,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Until relatively recently, however, the important effects of transmission constraints on both the trajectory and volatility of electricity prices have not played a large role in empirical models of prices. This paper explores the contribution to price volatility in the Queensland electricity market made by transmission constraints. It is found that robust estimation technique's are necessary to guard against incorrect inference in time series models using electricity price data in which severe price spikes occur. The main empirical lesson is that transmission constraints contribute significantly both to the level and variability of price and consequently the performance of a price forecasting model is likely to be improved by incorporating information on transmission constraints. While the general tenor of this conclusion will come as no surprise, the extent and the importance of these effects found in this paper for forecasting price and for computing summary measures like Value-at-Risk serve as a timely reminder to practitioners.","[Clements, Adam E.; Hurn, A.

Based on a hybrid stated and revealed preference survey (n = 132) in Salt Lake City, Utah, this paper studies the influence of attitudes and demographics on cycling frequency. A factor analysis of stated preferences shows the existence of four attitudinal factors concerning bicycling: safety, direct benefits, comfort, and timesaving. In turn, these are used in a multivariate model of cycling frequency and the decision to cycle is found to be positively correlated with the timesaving and convenience factors, and negatively correlated with preferences for travel comfort. Our results provide a broader empirical base for the complex relationships between attitudes, demographics and travel behaviors and point to some policy recommendations for increasing cycling uptake in the region.

Evidence from productivity of firms,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Road infrastructure; Productivity; China,INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; TRADE; IMPACT,"China's road investment boom since 1990 has often been criticized as excessive. In this paper, we estimate the return to road investment in China due to manufacturing firms' increased productivity between 1998 and 2007. To address endogeneity in road investment, we estimate the differential impact of road investment on firms with heterogeneous reliance on transport. Although some investment may be inefficient, our finding does not support the claim that road investment in China is excessive overall. The annual rate of return from productivity gains alone amounts to approximately 11%, partly due to positive spatial spillover. We find little return to road investment in inland China around 2000, but this has significantly improved since the mid-2000s. Our findings are robust to controlling for road quality, railroad investment, and variant markups of firms due to market demand and price shocks.","[Li, Zhigang] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines; [Wu, Mingqin] South China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bin R.] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Business Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Asian Development Bank; South China Normal University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Wu, MQ (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mingqinwu@163.com,,,Guandong Provincial Department of Science and Technology [2015A070704047]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302101],Guandong Provincial Department of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank the editor and two anonymous referees, for numerous constructive and insightful comments that greatly improved the article.

I estimate the energy efficiency premium in unlabeled office buildings by exploiting variation in mandatory building energy standard implementations as a result of the 1992 U.S. Energy Policy Act. A more stringent energy code leads to rent and price premiums of approximately 4 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Heterogeneity in the rent premium is also observed based on who pays the utility bills, as would be expected if market participants correctly evaluate energy conservation characteristics. The rent and price premiums are consistent with full capitalization of the energy savings from a more stringent standard.","[Papineau, Maya] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Papineau, M (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",maya.papineau@carleton.ca,,"Papineau, Maya/0000-0003-1499-1979",Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley's Haas Business School; Giannini Foundation for Agricultural Economics,Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley's Haas Business School; Giannini Foundation for Agricultural Economics,"Financial support from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley's Haas Business School, and the Giannini Foundation for Agricultural Economics is gratefully acknowledged.

This article argues that provisional assessments, produced early in the research cycle, can bridge the gap. Numerous case studies point to the importance of early interaction with policy makers and the delivery of brief, policy-focused papers; but preliminary analyses may be flawed and so increase the chances of a wrong decision. This article demonstrates analytically that a preliminary assessment, supported by the offer of more refined research, provides an option that is superior, on average, to the current practice of submitting a final report at the end of the research cycle. Where practical implementation is concerned, it calls for donor-funded subsidies to promote the use of provisional assessments and for a rapid, independent, professional review process to ensure their quality. While the research-policy exchange in developing countries is a complex, context-specific phenomenon, the proposal offered here holds out some promise of improving decisions in the public sphere under a wide range of circumstances.","[Bell, Clive] Heidelberg Univ, Econ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Bell, Clive] CMI, POB 6033, N-5892 Bergen, Norway; [Squire, Lyn] Global Dev Network, 4 Vasant Kunj Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Bell, C (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Econ, Heidelberg, Germany.;Bell, C (通讯作者)，CMI, POB 6033, N-5892 Bergen, Norway.",clive.bell@urz.uni-heidelberg.de; lynsquire@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

We investigate this topic experimentally from the perspective of those whom the foreign aid directly affects: recipient citizens and elites. We thus report results of a survey experiment with behavioral outcomes on more than 3000 Ugandan citizens and over 300 members of Uganda's Parliament. In spite of a large literature suggesting differences, the findings generally reveal few substantive differences in citizens' and elites' preferences and behavior toward the two types of aid. While no strong pattern of differences emerges, limited evidence suggests that the public evinces greater trust in multilateral institutions, and both masses and elites feel that multilateral aid is more transparent. Overall, these null results inform an ever-expanding literature, which is increasingly articulating distinctions between multilateral and bilateral aid. At least in the minds of the recipients, however, multilateral and bilateral aid may not in fact be all that different. This accords with the literature noting the strong overlap in aid organizations and bemoaning the fact that they do not specialize more. Our results raise the question about why have both multilateral and bilateral aid donors if they in effect do the same thing.","[Findley, Michael G.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, 3-108 BATTS Hall, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Milner, Helen V.] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, 431 Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nielson, Daniel L.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 745 SWKT, Provo, UT 84602 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Princeton University; Brigham Young University,"Findley, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, 3-108 BATTS Hall, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",mikefindley@utexas.edu; hmilner@princeton.edu; dan_nielson@byu.edu,,,,,,,69,22,26,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Building on the seminal methodology by Blanchard and Katz (1992), combined with multiple sources of regional population and migration data, we show that interstate mobility in response to relative labor demand conditions is not as high as previously established and has been weakening since the early 1990s. In addition, we find that mobility is countercyclical: net migration across regions responds more strongly to spatial disparities in recessions than in normal times. While the declining trend in mobility has been driven by weaker out-migration from states experiencing negative relative shocks, the mobility surge in recessions is mostly accounted for by temporarily stronger in-migration to better-performing states.","[Dao, Mai; Furceri, Davide; Loungani, Prakash] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Dao, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,27,36,51,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This article explores the nature, causes and potentials of judicial trust for the EU judicial system. A theory is offered in the article, which links national judges' trust in the CJEU to their corporatist identification and profile, to their attitudes towards the EU, and to their beliefs about the CJEU's ability to provide decisions that: 1) offer a clear guidance on European Union law, and 2) will not undermine Member States' legal order.","[Mayoral, Juan A.] Univ Copenhagen, iCourts, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Mayoral, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Ctr Excellence Int Courts, iCourts, Studiestr 6, DK-1455 Copenhagen, Denmark.",juan.mayoral@jur.ku.dk,"Mayoral, Juan A./B-9121-2015","Mayoral, Juan A./0000-0002-7192-3967","Spanish Judicial Council; Spanish Network of European Law; European Centre of Natolin; European University Institute; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF105]; iCourts, the Danish National Research Foundation's Centre of Excellence for International Courts","Spanish Judicial Council; Spanish Network of European Law; European Centre of Natolin; European University Institute; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); iCourts, the Danish National Research Foundation's Centre of Excellence for International Courts","The author wishes to thank Mikael Rask Madsen, Laurence R.

We provide evidence that electoral incentives distort rather than discipline incumbent mayors' behavior because transfers are higher before an election with an eligible incumbent, in line with the political budget cycle literature.

We exploit data on bookmaker spreads to estimate the probability of winning each game for college football teams. We then condition on these probabilities using a propensity score design to estimate the effects of winning on donations, applications, and enrollment. The resulting estimates represent causal effects under the assumption that, conditional on bookmaker spreads, winning is uncorrelated with potential outcomes. We find that winning reduces acceptance rates and increases donations, applications, academic reputation, in-state enrollment, and incoming SAT scores.","[Anderson, Michael L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Anderson, Michael L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Anderson, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Anderson, ML (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Anderson, Michael/0000-0002-4079-1965",,,,,47,26,44,1,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

In multimodal transport networks it is well acknowledged the use of information and communication technology (ICI') can deliver benefits that include real time track and trace, visibility and reduced lead-time, among others. Given the importance of the benefits associated to the adoption of ICT in the operation of multimodal transport networks, this work uses institutional-related theories in a multiple-case study comprising seven seaports terminals located in two continents. The purpose of the study is to identify key elements that affect and influence the adoption of ICT to support interoperability and connectivity in multi-modal seaport terminal operations. The analysis is used to identify groupings of influence linked to elements comprising institutional-related theories like coercion and mimesis, part of institutional isomorphism, among others. The study shows that both government legislation and dominant organizations running ports in various geographical locations exert great influence regarding ICT adoption policies in seaport terminals. The adoption of ICT has become important given the proliferation of technologies, the increasing need for track and trace capabilities and the economic impact of seaports terminals.

Accurate and reliable airport passenger demand forecasts are imperative for policymaking and planning by airport and airline management as well as by tourism authorities and operators. This article employs the Box-Jenkins SARIMA, SARIMAX and SARIMAX/ EGARCH volatility models to forecast international passenger arrivals for the eight key Australian airports (Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney). Monthly international tourist arrivals between January 2006 and September 2012 are used for the empirical analysis. All the forecasting models are highly accurate with the lower values of mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and root mean squared error. The findings suggest that the international passenger arrivals of Australian airports are affected by positive and negative shocks and tourism marketing expenditure is also a significant factor influencing the majority of Australian airports' international passenger arrivals.","[Tsui, Wai Hong Kan; Balli, Faruk] Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Tsui, Wai Hong Kan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Balli, Faruk] Univ Gediz, Izmir, Turkey",Massey University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Gediz University,"Tsui, WHK (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Aviat, Room 8-31,Social Sci Tower,Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",w.h.k.tsui@massey.ac.nz,"Balli, Faruk/H-8162-2019","Balli, Faruk/0000-0003-2372-4709",,,,,85,20,21,2,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Although these trips have substantial differences from other types of trips (and vehicles), they are frequently included either as standard passenger vehicles or, alternatively, as freight, if they are considered at all. However, light commercial vehicle trips used for commercial services comprise a substantial number of vehicle trips, particularly in areas with large concentrations of businesses such as the Sydney CBD and other growing business precincts, and for this reason should be included in travel demand models. As part of a large project involving the development of a comprehensive model system for predicting passenger, service and freight travel in Sydney (MetroScan-TI), this paper outlines the estimation and application of a set of models for service vehicles. The model system includes four models, a tour generation model, a tour type model, a Statistical Local Area (SLA) choice model and a destination (or travel zone) choice model. These models are estimated using data from a subset of the Sydney Household Travel Survey (HTS) involving work trips using LCVs, as well as detailed land-use and employment data from the 2011 Australian Census. We obtain a set of behaviourally rich and geographically detailed models that incorporate feedback through the use of several inclusive value (log sum) parameters. In addition to the overview of the model system, this paper discusses the estimation results and their application to policies.

In illuminating debt relations and worker dependency as an element of managers' repertoire of control, we compare a system known as comp-off' in contemporary Indian factories with the historical precedent of a system known as working dead horse' in Britain. Our comparison illuminates how value is extracted from workers and how old control systems are updated within the labour process, in a feminized sector where workers' associational power is weak and social downgrading is one means by which employers can offload risk, maximize flexibility and secure their position at the local level.","[Jenkins, Jean; Blyton, Paul] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Jenkins, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",jenkinsj1@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,16,17,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The PV reflects the importance of information about a given player's behavior for predicting, e.g., committee decisions that are subject to opinion interdependencies. The PV is characterized by anonymity, linearity, a consistency requirement and two normalization conditions. Every multinomial probabilistic value, hence every binomial semivalue, coincides with the PV for a particular family of probability distributions.

This is achieved primarily by combining one-step-ahead probability forecasts associated with each model. The paper applies well-established scoring rules for qualitative response models in the context of forecast combination. Log scores, quadratic scores and Epstein scores are used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of each model and to combine the probability forecasts. In addition to producing point forecasts, the effect of sampling variation is also assessed. This methodology is applied to forecast US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions regarding changes in the federal funds target rate. Several of the economic fundamentals influencing the FOMC's decisions are integrated, or I(1), and are modeled in a similar fashion to Hu and Phillips (J Appl Econom 19(7):851- 867, 2004).

This paper extends prior work, that has considered mostly the information pricing question in this archetypal three-ply bidders-auctioneer-information broker model, by enabling the information broker a richer strategic behavior in the form of anonymously eliminating some of the uncertainty associated with the common value, for free. The analysis of the augmented model enables illustrating two somehow non-intuitive phenomena in such settings: (a) the information broker indeed may benefit from disclosing for free some of the information she wishes to sell, even though this seemingly reduces the uncertainty her service aims to disambiguate; and (b) the information broker may benefit from publishing the free information to the general public rather than just to the auctioneer, hence preventing the edge from the latter, even if she is the only prospective customer of the service. While the extraction of the information broker's optimal strategy is computationally hard, we propose two heuristics that rely on the variance between the different values, as means for generating potential solutions that are highly efficient. The importance of the results is primarily in providing information brokers with a new paradigm for improving their expected profit in auction settings. The new paradigm is also demonstrated to result, in some cases, in a greater social welfare, hence can be of much interest to market designers as well.","[Alkoby, Shani; Sarne, David] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Alkoby, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",shani.alkoby@gmail.com,"Alkoby, Shani/AAF-5522-2019","Alkoby, Shani/0000-0002-0582-5832",,,,,38,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-1348,,978-3-319-54229-4; 978-3-319-54228-7,LECT NOTES BUS INF P,,,2017,271.0,,,,,,1,18,,10.1007/978-3-319-54229-4_1,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BI9HH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416093000001,0

Picasso has influenced numerous artists directly or indirectly - both the followers of Western school and artists here, in Latvia. The main topic of this research is Pablo Picasso's influence on Latvian artists, specifically - Visvaldis Ziedins, Rudolfs Pinnis and Aleksandrs Dembo. Picasso stands out for exceptionally virtuosic style - it was characteristic of him to begin each new work as an individual wholeness, experimenting with graphic forms, colours, textures, lines, volumes, playing with relations of dark and light and work's emotional atmosphere. Similarly, in the works of all three artists, the experiments with graphic forms and textures and virtuosic plays with relations of dark and lights and emotions are perceptible. Sharp sense of epoch, refined means of expression, depth of thinking, pictoriality, freedom of inspiration, nonconformity, intellectually difficult practice, lyrism, lightness and looseness, expressivity, spirituality - this is the common denominator of the artists - V. Ziedins, R. Pinnis and A. Dembo. For all these prominent artists, Picasso's creative work was not an object of imitation, but rather a launch pad to start acquiring the experience they were fascinated by. Research aim: to characterize creative work of the great Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and analyse his creative influence in the works of Latvian artists. Research methods: theoretical: the analysis of the study fields literature and internet resources.","[Apele, Diana] Rezeknes Tehnologiju Akad, Rezekne, Latvia",,"Apele, D (通讯作者)，Rezeknes Tehnologiju Akad, Rezekne, Latvia.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,2,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,15,26,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2417,0.0,,,12,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200001,0

One of the national statistics tasks is to provide with reliable information on the economic, social and demographic processes based on internationally recognized methodology. However, it is not permanently available, especially in municipalities level due to confidentiality restrictions or due to high costs, and this statistic always proclaims economic activity changes long after the fact. At the same time, the companies with operations and customers throughout the Latvia regions collect and regularly update a customer database. So, the rapid development of mobile technologies is giving the new source of statistical data, mobile positioning data, to evaluate the economic development of regions. The objective of the paper is to test mobile positioning data suitability for a theoretical model of updatable Latvian regional business index. The source of the Call Data Record is the largest Latvian mobile network operator Latvijas Mobilais Telefons. The latency of business conditions is consistent with economic theory which emphasizes that economic activity is about the dynamics and co-movement of many observable variables, so factor analysis was utilized to get basic statistics for Latvian regional business index. It is the clear difference between weekdays and weekend days that indicate call activity relation to economic activity. The results show the difference of the number of call and number of unique users, as well average call intensity between cities and counties. That could be justified by regions size (number of inhabitants, the density of population) as well as by different economic activity in the regions. Cities and counties with the less call activities have a lower economic activity to compare with the other region with high call activities during normal working hours.","[Arhipova, Irina] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Berzins, Gundars; Brekis, Edgars; Kravcova, Jevgenija] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Binde, Juris] JSC Latvijas Mobilais Telefons, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; University of Latvia,"Arhipova, I (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",irina.arhipova@llu.lv; gundars.berzins@lu.lv; ebrekis@gmail.com; jevgenijakravcova@gmail.com; juris.binde@lmt.lv,"Berzins, Gundars/AAZ-5669-2020; Arhipova, Irina/P-5666-2019; Brekis, Edgars/B-4654-2013; Arhipova, Irina/T-9682-2017","Berzins, Gundars/0000-0001-5058-4268; Arhipova, Irina/0000-0003-1036-2024;",University of Latvia [AAP2016/B089]; LMT Ltd.

We link a macroeconomic growth model and sectoral computable general equilibrium framework in order to project the world economy forward to the year 2035 and assess to what extent current trends in trade are expected to continue. Constructing fully traceable scenarios based on assumptions grounded in the literature, we are also able to isolate the relative impact of key economic drivers. We find that the stakes for developing countries are particularly high: the emergence of new players in the world economy, intensification of South-South trade and diversification into skill-intensive activities may continue only in a dynamic economic and open trade environment. Current trends towards increased regionalisation may be reversed, with multilateral trade relationships gaining in importance. Hypothetical mega-regionals could slow down, but not frustrate the prevalence of multilateralism. Continuing technological progress is likely to have the biggest impact on future economic developments around the globe. Population dynamics are influential as well: for some countries, upskilling will be crucial; for others, labour shortages may be addressed through migration. Several developing countries would benefit from increased capital mobility; others will only diversify into dynamic sectors, when trade costs are further reduced.","[Fontagne, Lionel] Univ Paris 01, PSE, Paris, France; [Fontagne, Lionel; Foure, Jean] CEPII, Paris, France; [Keck, Alexander] WTO, Econ Res & Stat Div, Geneva, Switzerland",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Fontagné, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, PSE, Paris, France.;Fontagné, L (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,32,10,10,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2017,40.0,1,,,,,36,55,,10.1111/twec.12479,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EK5CJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393944200003,0

We implement a second-generation panel unit root test, the panel cointegration analysis, accounting for multiple structural breaks, the panel dynamic ordinary least squares (PDOLS) estimations, and the panel-causality test in sequence. The empirical findings imply that there is only a statistically significant cointegration between the crude oil prices and the real GDP per capita levels. The results of the panelcausality test also indicate that there is a significant pairwise causal relationship between the levels of crude oil price and the real GDP per capita. In addition, the results of the PDOLS estimations indicate that 10% increase in the crude oil price leads to 1.8% increase in the real GDP per capita in the ASEAN economies in general.

We therefore analyze several matching mechanisms that take into account workers' preferences as well. We propose that the workers pay premiums to get preferred matches and auction-based models where preferences are expressed through variations of the payment for a task. We analyze the properties of two matching different mechanisms: Split Dynamic VCG (SDV) and e-Auction.

The aim of the paper is to examine the out-of-sample point and density forecasting performance of the Bayesian linear Autoregressive Conditional Volume (ACV) model with Weibull distribution for the error term for infra -daily volume data. The analysis follows a rolling window scheme and is based on real-time 5 -minute infra-daily traded volume data for stocks quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is a leading stock market in Central and Eastern Europe. It is concluded that in terms of point forecasts the considered Bayesian linear ACV model significantly outperforms such benchmarks as the naive or the Rolling Means methods. Moreover, the exponential error ACV models generate more accurate point forecasts than the structures with the Weibull distribution, but the differences between forecast errors are not in all cases statistically significant. The results obtained from analysis of density forecasts indicate that in most cases the linear ACV model with the Weibull distribution provides significantly better density forecasts as compared to the linear ACV model with exponential innovations in terms of the log -predictive score.","[Huptas, Roman] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Huptas, R (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",huptasr@uek.krakow.pl,"HUPTAS, ROMAN/U-8169-2018","HUPTAS, ROMAN/0000-0003-3502-6369",,,,,21,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,103,112,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000011,0

We allow for non-differentiable value functions, non-concave return functions, and non-convexities in the feasible choice set. This result fills an important gap in the literature for this commonly used numerical method as existing results assume differentiability of the value function, concavity of the return function, convexity of feasible choice sets, or simply do not consider the optimal policy function. Our results thus extend the existing literature to cover cases in which value function iteration becomes a common solution method and allow for economic applications such as modelling of technology adoption and payroll taxes not covered by previous results. Results on the convergence of the value function and optimal policy function allow for their use as the basis of studying convergence of computational solution, simulation, and estimation of more advanced Macroeconomic models.","[Kirkby, Robert] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Kirkby, R (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.",robertdkirkby@gmail.com,,"Kirkby, Robert/0000-0002-8242-0513",,,,,31,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It is all around us, in the myriad gadgets, computers, and networks that power modern life. However, the winning streak cannot last forever. For all phenomena of exponential growth, the question is not whether, but only when and why they will end, more specifically: would it be physics or economics that raises the barrier to further scaling? Physics has been our friend for decennia (Dennards Law) has now become the foe of further downscaling. In spite of all doomsday prophesies since the '80s, we will reach, thanks to the ingenuity of physicists and engineers, the famous red wall only within the next five to ten years and it might be a second an economic wall. The third wall may be a power wall, not just for the well-known power problems also for a other reasons, as the proportionality of system failure and power consumption. Some sort of Moore's law can also be found in the software area, as at operating systems doubling in size every new generation or as a law of diminishing returns or leading to the increasing reluctance to accept new hard and software generations?

In the research the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system was used for representation of essential content of every monograph Whereas vector space model was used for representation of online available book descriptions. Using these two methods of content description cluster analysis of monographs was performed. Assuming that a dendrogram generating by a cluster method reflects the content-based relationships between monographs, the similarity analysis of obtained dendrograms can be treated as a tool of convergence evaluation between information content of monograph descriptions having two different form: UDC expressions and textual descriptions.

In the fifth wave of the survey (carried out in 2013) two composite indicators of deprivation are evaluated. The answers to the selected questions (11 items for the material deprivation index and 15 items for the social deprivation index) from the survey are weighted into two composite indices with values transformed to the interval from 0 to 1. In the contribution, the empirical distributions of these indices in the Czech Republic are analysed and dependence on gender and size of household is treated. A mixture of two normal distributions for social inclusion index and a mixture of one discrete and two normal distributions for the index of material deprivation are fitted into the data. The models identify two homogenous subpopulations for social deprivation index and for positive values of material deprivation. 40 percent of respondents without any material deprivation were found in our data in comparison with less than 1 percent for the social deprivation index.

Following the latest threatening events and having in mind those yet to come, we can conclude that no country can benefit from the tourism industry if at the same time does not develop its security system as an integral part of the standard tourist offer. Analyzing the trends in contemporary tourism, the safety and security issues became the decisive factors for the choice of a certain destination. Consequently, countries must not perceive security systems and measures as an unnecessary expense but as an essential element in organizing their tourist services. All hotels and respectable tourist agencies should have a crisis management, with detailed, thoroughly elaborated procedures for emergency situations. Tourists should be timely informed about the potential dangers and risks and the measures taken to prevent them, as well as on procedures for emergency situations. Additionally, it would be good to have mobile applications that would enable tourists to make direct emergency calls with instructions on behavior in crisis situations. It is also essential to implement and put into effect sophisticated security measures such as using surveillance cameras, controlling access to buildings, information exchange with colleagues and neighbors, reporting the suspicious occurrences to the security services, and training staff for crisis management. Having in mind everything stated above, the security issue is definitely one of the crucial factors in the development of tourism in a certain country.","[Penic, Josipa; Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Penic, J (通讯作者)，Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia.",jpenic1990@yahoo.com; petar.kurecic@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,1,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,146,154,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300016,0

As a result, a constant monitoring of the development process at regional level with application of quantitative methods is an important scientific and practical task. Thus, the aim of the article is to assess the level of economic development in Poland at the voivodeships level (NUTS 2). Economic development is considered here as a multiple-criteria phenomenon. In the case of multiple-criteria analysis a common dilemma is attributed to the problem of applying appropriate weights for variables used in the research. Therefore, in order to provide a rating of voivodeships a taxonomic measure of development with entropy weights was applied here. The research was conducted for the years 2010-2014. It was based on the data provided by Central Statistical Office of Poland. The results of the analysis confirm that in spite of a progress obtained by all voivodeships significant disparities between them are still present.","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",michal.pietrzak@umk.pl; adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373",,,,,17,6,6,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,310,318,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000032,0

The accurate analysis of the effects of increased VAT rates is time-consuming, which is why in this paper the liquidity of hospitality and catering entities within the National Classification of Economic Activities 56 - Food and beverages service activities - has been analyzed as one of the most important measures of business stability, but in a reversed situation, based on past tax changes. The analysis covers the period when the VAT rate was reduced from 25% (as it was in 2012) to 10% (in 2013), or to 13% (in 2014). Using a representative sample of hospitality and catering enterprises from eight most developed tourism-oriented counties (public disclosure obligators which in 2015 generated over 5.2 million HRK of total revenues, thus excluding micro-enterprises), a significant increase in liquidity was confirmed for that period. The average current ratio grew by 55% in 2013, i.e. by 66% in 2014, the average quick ratio by 70% in 2013, i.e. by 76% in 2014, while the cash ratio rose by as much as 104 % in 2013. i.e. by 117% in 2014. All the differences in average indicators for the current, quick and cash ratios between 2012 and 2013, and between 2012 and 2014 were statistically significant, which was not the case with differences in average values between 2013 and 2014. Although in the period 2012 - 2014 many other reasons, apart from the VAT rate reduction, could have affected the results, they point towards a significantly higher liquidity of hospitality and catering entities in terms of lower VAT rates, as well as to the need to research it in more detail in future studies.","[Pisacic, Marica Klaric] Reg Off Split, Croatian Employment Serv, Split, Croatia; [Mladineo, Luka] Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Pisacic, MK (通讯作者)，Reg Off Split, Croatian Employment Serv, Split, Croatia.",maricaklaric@yahoo.com,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

We estimate the societal cost of energy not supplied (SCENS) due to an interruption. The results show that the most economically affected industries, following an outage, are different from the most inoperable ones. The results also indicate that SCENS varies with the duration of a power cut, ranging from 4,300 pound/MWh for a one-minute outage to 8,100 pound/MWh for a three-hour (and higher) interruption. The results can be used to design policies for contingencies and preventive investments in the power sector.","[Poudineh, Rahmatallah] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6FA, England; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England",University of Oxford; Durham University,"Poudineh, R (通讯作者)，Oxford Inst Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6FA, England.",rahmat.poudineh@oxfordenergy.org,,,,,,,43,11,11,0,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2017,38.0,1,,,,,51,76,,10.5547/01956574.38.1.rpou,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EF8XK,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000390615100003,0

Consolidation of Russian rule in some spheres undermined its control over others and led to an unexpected increase in cultural and political diversity.","[Sablin, Ivan] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Promyshlennaya Ul 17,Room 105, St Petersburg 198099, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Sablin, I (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Promyshlennaya Ul 17,Room 105, St Petersburg 198099, Russia.",isablin@hse.ru,"Sablin, Ivan/H-2250-2013","Sablin, Ivan/0000-0002-6706-4223",,,,,80,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,3,,,,,401,425,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1311299,0.0,,,25,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,EW6JD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402615300002,0

This paper provides a political economy analysis of the climate-relevant policies of China, India, Brazil and South Africa. It shows that alliances play a key role in driving such policies. However, most actors who support such policies have priorities other than climate change mitigation. Their support for such policies comes from concerns with securing energy, building competitive green industries, creating jobs or providing a basis for future public revenue. This insight is not just of analytical but also of political importance. It means that climate-relevant policies can draw on support from a wide constituency - not just those with green convictions. Such analysis provides the stepping-stone for understanding the political feasibility of low-carbon transformations.","[Schmitz, Hubert] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Schmitz, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",h.schmitz@ids.ac.uk,,,UK Department for International Development,UK Department for International Development,This research was funded by the UK Department for International Development.,,73,41,42,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

On average, wives underreport their husbands' income and underreporting is more prevalent in households with higher earning migrants. The discrepancy in earning reports is strongly correlated with variation in remittances: greater underreporting by wives is associated with lower remittances. We develop an exchange model of remittances with asymmetric information and costly state verification. The optimal remittance contract prescribes a threshold for remittances that invites verification only if unmet. The model's predictions closely match our empirical findings.","[Seshan, Ganesh] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv Qatar, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Zubrickas, Robertas] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath, Avon, England",Georgetown University; University of Bath,"Seshan, G (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv Qatar, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",gks7@georgetown.edu; r.zubrickas@bath.ac.uk,,"Zubrickas, Robertas/0000-0002-6940-5175","UREP grant from the Qatar National Research Fund, a member of The Qatar Foundation [4-7-11]","UREP grant from the Qatar National Research Fund, a member of The Qatar Foundation","We are grateful for comments and suggestions from presentations at the 2014 ABCDE conference (World Bank), 2014 WEAI Conference (Colorado), 2012 NEUDC Conference (Dartmouth College) and 2012 Australasian Development Economics Workshop (Monash University).

Data from Eurostat database are available from 1990 to 2014 for both countries. During this period, the behaviour of the population has changed in terms of family planning. The birth of the first child is being continuously postponed to later ages. Also, the fertility rates are lower. However, the situation between Poland and Czechia differs. Therefore, we compare the development. First, it is searched whether and when occurs normal shape of fertility function. Series of Jarque-Bera tests is applied on individual time series (functional data, where fertility rate is a function of women's age). The analysis revealed that occurs normal shape of fertility function in the age groups 15-49+ in both countries during the whole period. It has not been skewed to the right (to higher ages) yet. Second, the medians of fertility rates were analysed using principal components method implemented in demography and rainbow packages of the RStudio software. The changes in median fertility curves were examined based on two 10-years long time intervals: 1990-1999 and 2005-2014. We found that they were significantly shifted to the right. These results are important for subsequent analyses because for working with demographic data about fertility it is important to consider the most recent data, which are not significantly skewed and influenced by a range of factors. Estimated parameters of shape of fertility function can be also used for predictions.","[Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz,,,Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics Prague [35/2017],Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics Prague,The paper was financed from Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics Prague No. 35/2017 Demographic models in R software.,,16,1,1,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,431,439,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.35,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200035,0

First, we attempt to map the ways in which debt has been moving from sector to sector and from one group of countries to another within the global economy. By capturing this intersectorial, international, inter-regional movements of global debt, we aspire to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of global debt and its mode of operation. Second, we attempt to analyse what is wrong with global debt dynamics, that is, we examine the broken link between what global debt was supposed to do and what it does. Here, we point to three interrelated dynamics: the accumulation of unproductive debt, growing inequalities of income and wealth and the increase in privately created, interest-bearing money. We conclude by discussing how each paper in this special issue contributes to the current state of the art on the analysis of global debt dynamics in emerging and developing economies.","[Antoniades, Andreas] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Griffith-Jones, Stephany] Columbia Univ, Initiat Policy Dialogue, New York, NY USA; [Griffith-Jones, Stephany] Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; Columbia University,"Antoniades, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,"Antoniades, Andreas/AAZ-3923-2020","Antoniades, Andreas/0000-0002-6240-7389",Research Opportunities Fund of the University of Sussex,Research Opportunities Fund of the University of Sussex,"The authors would like to thank all the participants in the inaugural workshop of the Global Debt Dynamics Initiative that took place in Brighton on 26 May 2016, the anonymous reviewers of the papers of this special issue, and the Editors of The World Economy for all their cooperation and support.

Such a method, originally proposed by Gvozdik (Abstracts of the VI-th Moscow conference of young scientists on cybernetics and computing. Scientific Council on Cybernetics of RAS, Moscow, p 56, 1987), is based on the concept of maximum flow. Given a competition involving two or more teams, the flow network method can be used to build a relation on the set of teams which establishes, for every ordered pair of teams, if the first one did at least as good as the second one in the competition. Such a relation naturally induces procedures for ranking teams and selecting the best k teams of a competition.

Resembling free trade zones in form, free trade ports represent Chinas institutional innovation with strategic significance. They serve as an important platform for opening up Chinas economy. As a special area supervised by Chinas Customs, a typical free trade port zone is currently undergoing upgradation and transitioning into a free trade zone. Its development performance is the key factor in this process. In this study, a development performance evaluation system for a typical free trade port zone was established on the basis of theoretical models and empirical research. Six typical free trade port zones were selected in Chinas coastal areas: Yangshan, Yantai, Xiamen Haicang, Guangzhou Nansha, Ningbo Meishan and Tianjin Dongjiang. The development performances of these zones were evaluated using a system built by combining an analytic hierarchy process with a grey relational analysis. Additionally, empirical research was conducted for these six free trade port zones. By comparing the development levels of these zones, the main problems in each zone were identified, and upgrade measures were proposed.","[Chen, Jihong; Wan, Zheng; Zhang, Fangwei; Zhao, Jun] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Wan, Zheng] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Park, Nam-kyu] Tong Myong Univ, Sch Port Logist, Busan 608711, South Korea; [Zheng, Aibing] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Business Adm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jihong] Shanghai Int Shipping Inst, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Tongmyong University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Wan, Z (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Transport & Commun, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",mrwan@ucdavis.edu,,"Wan, Zheng/0000-0001-5352-3137","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51879156, 71704103, 51409157, 51508319]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC053]; Young Scholar Program of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education of China [14YJC630008]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Young Scholar Program of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 51879156, 71704103, 51409157 and 51508319), Shanghai Pujiang Program (17PJC053), and the Young Scholar Program of Humanities and Social Science of the Ministry of Education of China (14YJC630008).

The scorelines of 1,822 matches involving 98 first-tier teams were analyzed in terms of the overall ability of the teams and the spread of player abilities (heterogeneity) within them. As expected, total team ability has a beneficial effect on performance; the number of goals a team scores is positively related to its own ability and negatively related to the ability of its opponents. Team heterogeneity on the other hand has both beneficial and detrimental effects on performance. Heterogeneous teams score more goals than homogeneous teams, but they also concede more goals. As the effect of heterogeneity on goals conceded is greater than its effect on goals scored, the net effect of heterogeneity is to depress overall performance. The results are discussed in terms of Steiner's framework of group dynamics.","[Gelade, Garry A.] Business Analyt Ltd, 1 Circus Lodge,Circus Rd, London NW8 9JL, England",,"Gelade, GA (通讯作者)，Business Analyt Ltd, 1 Circus Lodge,Circus Rd, London NW8 9JL, England.",garry@business-analytic.co.uk,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

While change in the physical environment is slow, change in the policy context is even slower, particularly in the way cyclists are currently largely absent from the driver licensing process. This study used content analysis to examine the inclusion of cycling-related content in the driver licensing process across Australia. The review included all government authorised documentation related to gaining a driver licence. Study findings reveal that cyclists are referred to almost exclusively in neutral or negative terms. Negative references included characterising cyclists as unpredictable, untrained and 'hazards'. The driver licensing documentation provided limited information to drivers about how to safely share the road with cyclists. Omission or problematic representation of cyclists in the driver licensing process fails to recognise cyclists as legitimate road users who drivers should expect to encounter on the roads. The driver licensing process is an opportunity to teach new drivers safe practices, particularly in relation to vulnerable road users that is not currently being optimised in Australia. Action is needed to increase the inclusion and representation of cyclists through the driver licensing process in Australia.","[Bonham, Jennifer] Univ Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Johnson, Marilyn] Monash Univ, Inst Transport Studies, Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Johnson, Marilyn] Amy Gillett Fdn, 181 St Kilda Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3182, Australia; [Haworth, Narelle] Queensland Univ Technol, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia",University of Adelaide; Monash University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Bonham, J (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",jennifer.bonham@adelaide.edu.au,"Haworth, Narelle/AAV-4845-2021; Johnson, Marilyn/IYJ-0004-2023","Haworth, Narelle/0000-0003-2514-787X; Johnson, Marilyn/0000-0003-1272-1684","Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [LP150100071]; Motor Accident Commission of South Australia; Amy Gillett Foundation, Australia; Royal Automobile Association of South Australia; Adelaide City Council, Australia; Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (South Australia); Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics (Northern Territory, Australia); Australian Research Council [LP150100071] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Motor Accident Commission of South Australia; Amy Gillett Foundation, Australia; Royal Automobile Association of South Australia; Adelaide City Council, Australia; Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (South Australia); Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics (Northern Territory, Australia); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This research was funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council (LP150100071) in collaboration with the Motor Accident Commission of South Australia, Amy Gillett Foundation, Australia, Royal Automobile Association of South Australia, Adelaide City Council, Australia, Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (South Australia), Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics (Northern Territory, Australia).

First, analytically, that contrary to the prevailing view, the EU's constitutional settlement is holding, although it has come under assault from federalists and sovereignists alike. The bicycle theory nevertheless continues to hold sway perhaps because paradigm shifts always exhibit significant lags. Second, normatively, to defend 'the equilibrium' does not amount to a defense of the status quo. On the contrary, and especially in the context of the eurozone crisis, we must reflect on the social foundations of the European project, of which intermittent democratic discontent is only one expression. The argument unfolds through four European cities, each regarding a different moment in the Constitutional saga of the last two decades, to conclude on the relationship between LI and demoicratic theory, as well as the promise of sustainable integration.","[Nicolaidis, Kalypso] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX2 6JF, England",University of Oxford,"Nicolaidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX2 6JF, England.",kalypso.nicolaidis@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,7,7,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

How relevant does LI remain under these circumstances in comparison with its neofunctionalist and postfunctionalist competitors? A comparative analysis of the three crises shows that LI offers only a partial explanation of national preference formation in the crises. As a static theory, it fails to take into account endogenous preferences that may result from path-dependence (in the euro crisis) or politicization (in the Brexit crisis).

How do co-workers on rival sides in war-torn countries cope with these manifestations? Interviews with nurses, nursing assistants and physicians in a Palestinian-Arab hospital and in a Jewish retirement home reveal how the broader ethno-national conflict in Israel penetrates the workplace. Problems arise for them when violence related to the conflict erupts outside the workplace and when patients express racist views during interactions with medical staff. This study finds that staff members respond with split ascription', a grassroots coping strategy that differentiates between a cooperative work environment and discriminatory structural elements of the employing organization. Split ascription challenges existing theories of interethnic relations in the workplace, as it combines both interactional and structural elements within a single coping strategy.","[Darr, Asaf] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 7017 Rabin Bldg, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Darr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 7017 Rabin Bldg, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",adarr@univ.haifa.ac.il,,,Israel Science Foundation [667/10],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"This study was supported by the Israel Science Foundation, agreement # 667/10.",,29,3,3,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The significance of the Compass4D deployments and results provides some of the first evidence of the effectiveness of C-ITS in real world conditions. Both light and heavy vehicles showed efficiency savings of 2-6%. Equipped buses exhibited a variety of results with one pilot site showing a reduction of greater than 200gCO(2) per bus route per trip whilst other buses showed an increase in total emissions. The paper presents results from both field trials and microscopic simulation studies (to understand the network- or city-wide impacts of the technology). It discusses the results in detail before outlining the potential for further deployment in terms of the impact on energy efficiency and environmental objectives.

It extends the widely used difference-in-differences approach to the time series setting and enables several control series to be used to construct the counterfactual. This paper highlights the benefits of using this methodology to estimate the effectiveness of an absolute ban on smoking in public places, compared with a partial ban. In January 2006, the Spanish government enacted a tobacco control law which banned smoking in bars and restaurants, with exceptions depending on the floor space of the premises. In January 2011, further legislation in this area was adopted, removing these exceptions. The data source used for our study was the monthly legal sales of cigarettes in Spain from January 2000 to December 2014. The potential control series were the monthly tourist arrivals from the United Kingdom, the total number of visitors from France, the unemployment rate and the average price of cigarettes. Analysis of the state-space model leads us to conclude that the partial ban was not effective in reducing the tobacco sold in Spain, but that the total ban contributed significantly to reducing cigarette consumption.","[Pinilla, Jaime; Negrin, Miguel; Gonzalez-Lopez-Valcarcel, Beatriz; Vazquez-Polo, Francisco-Jose] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Negrín, M (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Quantitat Methods, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jaime.pinilla@ulpgc.es; miguel.negrin@ulpgc.es; beatriz.lopezvalcarcel@ulpgc.es; francisco.vazquezpolo@ulpgc.es,"Pinilla, Jaime/F-8132-2016; Vázquez-Polo, F.J./AAE-3635-2019; Polo, Francisco José Vázquez/C-9730-2009","Pinilla, Jaime/0000-0002-7126-4236; Polo, Francisco José Vázquez/0000-0002-0632-6138","MINECO, Spain [ECO2013-47092-P, ECO2017-35755-P, ECO2013-48217-C2-1-R]","MINECO, Spain(Spanish Government)","The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions on an earlier version of the paper.

Using a sample of US restaurant firms, we empirically evaluated the extent to which franchising provides greater insights into ICFS. By investigating the industry-specific effect of franchising on ICFS, the current study provides a more comprehensive understanding and explanation for the interaction between investment and financing decisions in the US restaurant industry.

I examine the association between HIV status, own knowledge about status, and preventive health behavior using household survey data from over 200,000 individuals in 25 sub-Saharan African countries. I find that individuals who are HIV positive and have taken a standard HIV test are much more likely to engage in efforts to prevent HIV transmission than are individuals who are HIV negative and have taken a standard HIV test. Moreover, this difference is greater than the difference between HIV positives and HIV negatives for individuals who have not taken a standard HIV test. Consistent with an altruistic motivation, this double-difference is larger for individuals who are married than for individuals who are not married. These results appear to be the first evidence on the change in risky sexual behavior associated with HIV testing at scale and are consistent with altruism dominating any self-interested response to HIV testing.

We analyze the trade-off between the benefits, in the form of revenues for airlines and airports as well as greater variety for passengers and the costs that arise from delays. Utilizing a non-parametric structural equation modeling approach, we compare a set of US airports with their first-come first-served policy to those of Europe in which slots are allocated according to grandfather rights. Delays in Europe are much lower than their US counterparts, suggesting that regulation in Europe could be relaxed leading to increased movements and relatively minor increases in delays hence higher overall social welfare. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find that the introduction of slots in the US (or reduction in slots allocated at the four currently constrained airports) would not necessarily increase overall social welfare. In summation, European regulation prevents optimal use of current infrastructure whereas the US system is better able to capitalize on their existing infrastructure.","[Adler, Nicole; Yazhemsky, Ekaterina] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Adler, N (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",msnic@huji.ac.il,"Adler, Nicole/GYV-1956-2022; Adler, Nicole/AAL-5010-2021","Adler, Nicole/0000-0002-5242-2542; Adler, Nicole/0000-0002-5242-2542",Judith Teller Foundation,Judith Teller Foundation,"We would like to thank Mr. Itai Alon and the Fisher Institute for their help throughout the process and Mr. Marty Goldberg and the Judith Teller Foundation for funding.

Analyzing geo-enriched data on nearly 4,800 hotel transactions in the United States, we find that the relative positioning of an asset's attributes - particularly at the extremes - has a significant impact on transaction prices. We also detect separating equilibria for extreme attributes across the premium and discount hotel segments. Extreme attributes stand out and are value enhancing in premium hotel segments. In contrast, extreme attributes are value diminishing in the discount hotel segment. The relative degree to which the asset's attributes are extreme is important. Being a locally largest asset has a negative effect on price, however the negative effect is more than offset if the hotel is among the largest hotels nationally. The results suggest that locally extreme assets, unless also nationally extreme, are considered atypical and trade at a discount.","[Das, Prashant] Univ Appl Sci Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Smith, Patrick] San Diego State Univ, Fowler Coll Business Adm, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Gallimore, Paul] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Reading,"Das, P (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland.",prashant.das@ehl.ch; patrick.smith@sdsu.edu; p.gallimore@henley.reading.ac.uk,,"Das, Prashant/0000-0002-3628-7213",,,,,55,7,9,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, much research suggests that on an empirical basis this expectation does not hold. Pettengill, Sundaram and Mathur (1995) [PSM] suggest that the problem is that expected risk-return relationships are positive, but actual outcomes can vary. Thus we implement the PSM procedure to determine if we can obtain better explanatory ability for REIT returns relative to beta. Using PSM's suggested technique, we find evidence that REIT stocks with higher betas have more positive returns when the realized market returns exceed risk-free rates and more negative returns when the realized market returns fall below risk-free rates. Furthermore, we form REIT portfolios based on betas and find that similar results hold for portfolio level: REIT portfolios with higher betas have more positive returns when the realized market returns exceed risk-free rates and more negative returns when the realized market returns fall below risk-free rates. We also examine beta relative to up and downside risk as suggested in Harlow and Rao (1989) [HR]. By using HR conditional beta approach, we find that REIT investors seem to view losses differently than gains. Our study is to determine if we can validate the positive risk-return trade-off predicted by CAPM and to show that a significant and positive systematic beta-return relation exists in both static and conditional CAPM model settings. We believe that our research effort is the first to incorporate both static beta estimation and asymmetric beta estimation to show a significantly positive risk-return trade-off in the industry of real estate investment trusts. Using HR generalized Mean-Lower Partial Moment Asset Pricing Model, we confirm that REIT stocks with higher downside betas have higher average returns, but upside betas are insignificant in the beta-return relation for REITs. We find similar results for portfolio level as well. Consistent with the findings on real estate market index returns in Cheng (2005), our results go beyond his findings to highlight the significance of downside beta risk in REIT industry during the recent global financial crisis.","[Glascock, John L.; Lu-Andrews, Ran] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lu-Andrews, Ran] Calif Lutheran Univ, Sch Management, 60 W Olsen Rd, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA",University of Connecticut; California Lutheran University,"Lu-Andrews, R (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Lu-Andrews, R (通讯作者)，Calif Lutheran Univ, Sch Management, 60 W Olsen Rd, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA.",john.glascock@business.uconn.edu; rluandrews@callutheran.edu,,,,,,,34,6,7,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The undervaluation of women's work has been identified as one of the main causes of the gender pay gap. Despite this, it continues to escape many of the policy measures on gender pay equity that focus on establishing wage discrimination. The Finnish local government sector provides an interesting case for research on undervaluation, as it has several collective agreements and several wage determination systems for different employee groups. However, a local authority is a single employer, and is obliged by law to treat all employees equally. Although the processes of wage determination vary across different national contexts, institutionalised undervaluation is very likely among highly feminised jobs and occupations worldwide.

For players facing a potential one-game suspension, being one versus two yellow cards away from the suspension limit results in an approximate 12% reduction in fouling, while for those facing a potential two-game suspension, the reduction is approximately 23%. The probability such players receive a yellow card is also reduced. In addition, we find some evidence of slight referee bias for the home team in the dispensing of penalty cards, but not in the calling of fouls. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework for investigating the effects of suspension rules on the number of fouls committed. Within this framework, we investigate how policy instruments such as referees' propensity to give out yellow cards or their consistency in giving them out affect the impact of suspension rules.","[VanDerwerken, Douglas N.; Nguelifack, Brice M.] US Naval Acad, Dept Math, 589 McNair Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Rothert, Jacek] US Naval Acad, Dept Econ, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy,"VanDerwerken, DN (通讯作者)，US Naval Acad, Dept Math, 589 McNair Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA.",vanderwe@usna.edu,"Rothert, Jacek/AAO-1764-2020; Nguelifack, Brice Merlin/ABE-8209-2020","Rothert, Jacek/0000-0002-4453-240X",,,,,29,4,4,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Two models are compared: a linear/ quadratic (LQ) model and a nonparametric model. Two estimation methods are used: (a) minimizing the squared difference between the observed records and the modeled biological frontier and (b) using extreme value theory to estimate the biological frontier that maximizes the probability of observing the existing world records by age. The results support the LQ model and suggest a linear percentage decline up to the late 70s and quadratic decline after that.,"[Fair, Ray C.; Kaplan, Edward H.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Fair, RC (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,6,2,3,0,0,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

This paper addresses this empirical gap with reference to the EU's promotion of regulatory reforms in three economic sectors in Egypt: agriculture, banking and telecoms. It finds that these reforms are significantly, if selectively, informed by ordoliberal principles and practices. Two theoretical implications of this finding are explored. On the one hand, while this substantiates the institutional isomorphism hypothesis, for which the EU tends to export its own models elsewhere, the selectivity with which this occurs demonstrates greater instrumentality than usually maintained in this literature. On the other hand, understanding ordoliberalism as a variation within the neoliberal template shaping restructuring in Egypt, this paper moves beyond binary views of regulatory co-operation and competition and thus also enriches debates on the EU as a global regulator.","[Roccu, Roberto] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Roccu, R (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, Int Polit Econ, Virginia Woolf Bldg,22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6LE, England.",roberto.roccu@kcl.ac.uk,,"Roccu, Roberto/0000-0003-3542-5765",European Research Council (ERC) [263277],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Research for this article was carried out in the framework of the research project 'BORDERLANDS: Boundaries, Governance, and Power in the European Union's Relations with North Africa and the Middle East', funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under Grant Agreement Number 263277 and directed by Raffaella Del Sarto.

We exploit this lottery to study the causal effect on shareholder value of government involvement in the corporate governance of banks. We find that the rejection of the bill resulted in positive abnormal returns that persisted in the following days.

After distinguishing between public investment by the central government and that by local governments, this paper utilizes wavelet techniques to examine macroeconomic policy coordination between Japanese central and local governments. We demonstrate that local government investments fail to coordinate with central government investments during the lost two decades, and such a coordination failure is a one-time phenomenon in nearly a half-century. In this period, local government investments exhibit no countercyclical behavior to business cycles, which is contributory to the ineffectiveness of fiscal stimulus that is pointed out by our predecessors.","[Funashima, Yoshito] Tohoku Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Aoba Ku, 1-3-1 Tsuchitoi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808511, Japan",Tohoku Gakuin University,"Funashima, Y (通讯作者)，Tohoku Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Aoba Ku, 1-3-1 Tsuchitoi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808511, Japan.",funashima@mail.tohoku-gakuin.ac.jp,,"Funashima, Yoshito/0000-0002-4108-5480",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25380368]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380368] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",I would like to thank an anonymous referee and Tomomi Miyazaki for their helpful comments.

It notes while some commentators suggest advanced economies are characterized by managerial job insecurity, others argue the same economies possess stable managerial tenure rates. To make sense of this conundrum, qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with managers working in large corporations in liberal-market (USA, UK) and coordinated-market (Japan) societies are analysed. The aim is to assess whether sensitivity to managerial job insecurity is widespread and if so reflects wider corporate strategies of contrived competition' and manufactured uncertainty'. It is argued such notions can influence managers' understanding of their work situation through (re)producing narratives of employment precarity. Contrary to the message from many database and questionnaire studies, evidence from this international and longitudinal study suggests awareness of job insecurity is indeed widespread and does affect managers' views of their employment situation and prospects.","[Hassard, John] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business School, Org Anal, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Morris, Jonathan] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",University of Manchester; Cardiff University,"Hassard, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",john.hassard@manchester.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (UK); university of Cardiff; university of Manchester,Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); university of Cardiff; university of Manchester,The first phase of research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (UK).

This paper investigates empirically how the effects of renewables are affected by market expansion across two adjacent countries (France and Germany), based on market data and proprietary data on book orders. We find that wind production lowers power prices on average and increases volatility, not only domestically but also across borders. Using multiple counterfactuals, we examine how our results depend on the level of interconnection and find that further interconnection capacity would decrease price volatility in both countries since the benefits of a larger market would outweigh the contagion effects of volatility. Our findings have important policy implications as they demonstrate the need to coordinate support policies for renewables and policies to support transmission capacity expansion in order to mitigate the impact of volatility on power prices in neighboring power markets.","[Annan-Phan, Sebastien] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Annan-Phan, Sebastien] CEEM, Paris, France; [Roques, Fabien A.] Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ Dauphine LEDA CGEMP, Paris, France; [Roques, Fabien A.] Paris Dauphine Univ, CEEM, Paris, France",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Roques, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, Lab Econ Dauphine LEDA CGEMP, Paris, France.;Roques, FA (通讯作者)，Paris Dauphine Univ, CEEM, Paris, France.",fabien.roques@dauphine.fr,,,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - RTE; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - EDF; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - EPEX Spot; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - CELEST,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - RTE; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - EDF; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - EPEX Spot; Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Universite Paris-Dauphine under the aegis of the Foundation Paris-Dauphine - CELEST,"We are grateful to EPEXSPOT for providing the data on power prices and market resilience that were used in this paper.

The performance of the method was evaluated in terms of headway stability, holding time, and mean passenger waiting time. The method was found to improve headway stability compared to the schedule, but required longer holds in some cases.

When a buyer purchases a property intending to tear down the existing structure and rebuild, the value of land can potentially be estimated as the purchase price plus demolition costs. There has been little exploration of teardown sales in cities around the country, or any explicit comparisons between the estimates of land values derived from teardown sales and those derived through vacant land sales. This paper undertakes just such an explicit comparison, analyzing approximately 3800 teardown sales and 4900 vacant land sales occurring in New York City between 2003 and 2009. The two approaches yield surprisingly similar estimates of the value of both parcel attributes and locational amenities. However, vacant parcels are disproportionately located in very distressed neighborhoods and tend to be valued less highly than teardown parcels, even in the same neighborhood. Teardown parcels appear to be more representative of the city as a whole and may be a more useful approach to developing estimates of land prices, at least in the central cities of large urban areas where sample sizes are large enough.","[Gedal, Michael; Ellen, Ingrid Gould] NYU, Furman Ctr Real Estate & Urban Policy, 139 MacDougal St 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Gedal, Michael] 139 MacDougal St 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Gedal, M (通讯作者)，NYU, Furman Ctr Real Estate & Urban Policy, 139 MacDougal St 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.;Gedal, M (通讯作者)，139 MacDougal St 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",michael.gedal@nyu.edu,,,,,,,20,18,20,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Much of the scholarship on ecosystems has focused on identifying key components and understanding factors influencing the entrepreneurial process. While scholars have acknowledged the importance of connection as the means through which information, knowledge, and resources are shared, most of the discussion has focused on entrepreneurs as the unit of analysis with limited attention to connections between entrepreneurial support organizations. This comparative analysis examines partnership and leadership among entrepreneurial support organizations in Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Richmond. The author argues that differences in partnership practices across the cases are in part a function of the unique leadership models shaping each ecosystem's cultural and institutional norms. Understanding the role of leadership could be critical for shaping the collaborative environments for which most ecosystem stakeholders are hoping.","[Harper-Anderson, Elsie] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, L Douglas Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Harper-Anderson, E (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, 1001 West Franklin St,Room 3015C, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",elharperande@vcu.edu,,"Harper-Anderson, Elsie/0000-0001-8182-0366",,,,,67,22,29,5,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This article analyzes how the EU civil society field has been re-shaped by the ECI, the creation of networks and relationships between EU and national organizations and the effects of politicization. Using interview data and online documents from five ECI cases, we argue that an ECI can potentially transform the meta-field of civil society and democracy by altering what is at stake. We show that the five cases compete in a single field of civil society in the EU where incumbent organizations react to challenges. However, the field cannot be characterized in terms of a competition between insiders and outsiders. Rather, the ECI favours actors able to combine activism in different spheres - which we call multi-positional actors.","[Oleart, Alvaro] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Bouza, Luis] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Bouza, Luis] Coll Europe, Brugge, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Bouza, L (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dpto Ciencia Polit & RRII, Fac Derecho, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",luis.bouza@coleurope.eu,"García, Luis Bouza/M-3297-2014; Oleart, Alvaro/HDN-2904-2022","García, Luis Bouza/0000-0002-0486-2340; Oleart, Alvaro/0000-0002-9696-4298",ValEUR ARC project at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB),ValEUR ARC project at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB),"Alvaro Oleart is grateful for the support of the ValEUR ARC project (http://valeur.ulb.be) at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), in particular to the team's promoters: Ramona Coman, Francois Foret and Francois Heinderyckx.",,40,19,19,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The extent to which this has come to be in the context of migration, and the successive waves of policy and institutional reforms concerning these agencies in the last decade, pose several questions that the existing literature is only partially equipped to answer. This paper addresses this gap by charting the evolution of EU agencies through documentary analysis, reflecting on the meaning of this evolution for current trends in European integration as captured by the recent theorization on de novo bodies. Findings demonstrate that, far from being static entities, these bodies have constantly deepened their reach into the formation and application of migration policy, while posing no substantial erosion of the authority of the Commission. This incremental empowerment has created accountability issues from the beginning, many of which are still far from being resolved.","[Scipioni, Marco] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bologna, Italy",Johns Hopkins University,"Scipioni, M (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Bologna Ctr, Via Belmeloro 11, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",mscipioni@jhu.edu,"Scipioni, Marco/AAZ-6631-2021","Scipioni, Marco/0000-0002-1432-2970",,,,,62,16,16,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The global factors affect all individuals, whereas the country factors affect only those within each specific country. A sequential procedure to identify the global and country factors separately is proposed. In the initial step, the global factors are estimated by canonical correlation analysis. Using this initial estimator, the principal component estimators (PCEs) of the global and country factors are constructed. It is shown that the PCEs estimate the spaces of the global and country factors consistently and are normally distributed in the limit. Several information criteria that can estimate the number of country factors are proposed. The number of global factors is assumed to be known. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the sequential procedure and information criteria work well in finite samples. The method of this paper is applied to 25 OECD countries to identify an international business cycle. It is reported that the method extracts a global factor reasonably well.","[Choi, In; Kim, Yun Jung; Kwark, Noh-Sun] Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 04107, South Korea; [Kim, Dukpa] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University; Korea University,"Choi, I (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 04107, South Korea.",inchoi@gmail.com,"Kim, Dukpa/AAN-5624-2021",,,,,,56,18,18,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

As a consequence, conventional tests spuriously indicate nonlinearity. Next, we examine an alternative maximum likelihood approach. Our findings suggest that this approach has substantially better size properties than tests based on least-squares and heteroskedasticity-consistent matrix estimators, and performs comparably to a bootstrap technique.","[Pavlidis, Efthymios G.; Tsionas, Mike] Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Lancaster University,"Pavlidis, EG (通讯作者)，Lancaster Univ Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",e.pavlidis@lancaster.ac.uk,"Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106; Pavlidis, Efthymios/0000-0002-4892-1955",,,,,19,0,0,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The 1990s debate stimulated a new and now large field of economic research, but in hindsight it suffered from errors of omission on both sides, and from an academic perspective it ended prematurely. Even now, the available evidence does not permit any firm conclusion about the contribution of globalisation to the rise in inequality in developed countries over the past few decades. The economic consensus at the end of the debate also fostered unwarranted political complacency about the social costs of globalisation.","[Wood, Adrian] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Wood, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England.",,,,,,,,90,22,25,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41.0,4,,,SI,,975,999,,10.1111/twec.12619,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430113300003,0

Think of this as the election of chairman in an academic department, a parent-teacher association, or a condominium association board, where the election winner perceives office holding as a cost, and not benefit. We prove that in such a game, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist even when the policy implementation costs are heterogeneous, as long as they are not very large. We also provide the equilibrium characterization, comparative statics, and welfare analysis in the case of Euclidean preferences. In particular, we show that equilibrium strategies are divergent and in general not symmetric around the expected bliss point of the median voter. A higher policy implementation cost makes a candidate propose a more extreme policy, and lowers his electoral chances. Naturally, the voter's welfare decreases when the candidates' implementation costs increase.","[Xefteris, Dimitrios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Zudenkova, Galina] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Cyprus; University of Mannheim,"Zudenkova, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",dxefteris@gmail.com; galina.zudenkova@gmail.com,"Zudenkova, Galina/KCJ-5560-2024; Xefteris, Dimitrios/S-4080-2017","Zudenkova, Galina/0000-0002-0008-2427; Xefteris, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7397-5288",Karin-Islinger-Stiftung Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and nnovations [ECO2011-25203],Karin-Islinger-Stiftung Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and nnovations,"The authors are grateful to Luis Corchon, Eckhard Janeba, Ignacio Ortuno Ortin, two anonymous referees, the associate editor, and seminar and conference participants at several institutions for their useful comments and suggestions.

We distinguish between real power (utility gain from being in groups) and power-related parameters in group decision making, like utilitarian welfare weights in the case of welfare maximization or relative bargaining power in Nash bargaining. We find that higher parametric power does not necessarily translate into higher equilibrium utility or higher real power. One reason is that induced price changes may offset the group member's increased influence and the resulting benefits. A second reason is that the group may dissolve when a group member gains too much influence, because other members can exercise the option to leave. We also show that maximal real power can be compatible with Pareto efficiency. We further identify circumstances when changes of power in one group do not impact on other groups.

The emission growth is more than triple the emission reductions that the European Union and the United States have committed to in the same period.","[Yang, Yuan; Wang, Can] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuan; Wang, Can] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Duke Kunshan Univ, Environm Res Ctr, Kunshan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Duke Kunshan University; Duke University,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, C (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",canwang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"WANG, CAN/GWV-0969-2022","Zhang, Junjie/0000-0002-0716-3828","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603602]; China Natural Science Foundation [71525007, 71773062]",National Key R&D Program of China; China Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFA0603602) and China Natural Science Foundation (No. 71525007; No. 71773062).

This study measures the influence of incubator quality and regional capacity variables on incubation outcomes using survey data from program managers across the United States. Results suggest that incubator quality variables have a stronger causal influence on successful incubation outcomes than regional capacity variables. While regional capacity is a stronger predictor for graduate-firm outcomes than for tenant-firm outcomes, incubator quality matters more overall. Results suggest that quality incubation may compensate for deficiencies in regional innovative capacity, which is often associated with entrepreneurial success. This research is expected to help policy makers more effectively use business incubators to hatch innovation-based entrepreneurial development.","[Harper-Anderson, Elsie] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, L Douglas Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, Richmond, VA USA; [Lewis, David A.] SUNY Albany, Geog & Planning, Albany, NY 12222 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Harper-Anderson, E (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Urban & Reg Planning, 923 West Franklin St,Box 842028, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",elharperande@vcu.edu,,"Harper-Anderson, Elsie/0000-0001-8182-0366",U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration,U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration.",,76,27,39,2,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We have known that momentum profits exist in the latter by applying Jegadeesh and Titman's (J Financ 48:65-91, 1993) model with 6-month formation and holding periods. However, there are only a few studies on momentum profits in China. Therefore, this study examines whether the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets produce momentum profits. We find that these two markets have significant contrarian but not momentum profits. We also create an artificial momentum portfolio and follow Bhattacharya et al. (Account Rev 78:641-678, 2003) to compute the transparency indices. Our outcomes show that the corporate transparencies of the winners (losers) in the artificial momentum portfolios are close to those in the commonly-defined momentum portfolios. The averages of the decile transparencies are between 4.5 and 6.5, not only for the top 10% of winners but also for the bottom 10% of losers. According to these results, we suggest that financial transparency is irrelevant to the inertia and reversal of stock prices in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets.","[Lin, Hung-Wen] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hung, Mao-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Int Business, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Jing-Bo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Nanfang College, Guangzhou; National Taiwan University; Sun Yat Sen University","Lin, HW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",pm4@nccu.edu.tw,,"Lin, Hung-Wen/0000-0002-0015-2528",,,,,24,2,2,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The by-production approach models these technologies as intersections of two independent sub-technologies reflecting (1) the relations between goods in intended-output production designed by human engineers and (2) the emission-generating mechanism of nature governed by material-balance considerations. The axiomatic approach proposes a set of axioms that a pollution-generating technology should satisfy. We show that the by-production technology satisfies these axioms and that, conversely, any technology satisfying the axioms can be decomposed into two sub-technologies satisfying the by-production properties. In either approach, the technology can be functionally represented by two radial distance functions with well-defined properties. These distance functions can also serve as measures of technological and environmental efficiency. We exploit the link between the by-production and axiomatic approaches to offer preliminary suggestions about suitable functional forms for the empirical estimation of the two distance functions.","[Murty, Sushama] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Murty, Sushama] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi, India; [Russell, R.

In the social acceptability pillar we will include animal welfare and other ethical aspects that may relate to the production system as it is currently deployed. One of the major arguments in favour of veal production as it is currently known, is the assertion that it is a way to prevent male offspring of dairy cattle to be considered mere by-products that need to be disposed of. In such dairy production systems these male calves are quickly removed and culled. This has economic and ecological benefits: avoiding food waste by adding value to a product. Slaughtering young calves for veal production wouldn't be an issue to be discussed in a strong animal rights ethics as in this perspective any kind of killing is considered unethical. In an ethics that integrates proportionality, it is certainly not morally neutral, maybe even problematic. Veal production is one of those sectors that are said to be highly instrumentalising to animals. Not only are calves a 'by-product' of milk production, some also indicate the unnaturalness of the system. There is an interesting parallel between intensive veal production and the production of Belgian Blue cattle. In both cases, veterinarian measures are taken to ensure animal welfare, where problems are almost determined by the context. Veal production is extremely antibiotics dependent: virtually 100% of calves are treated with antibiotics. This could be considered a case of extreme instrumentalisation, and results in several negative effects, such as development of antibiotic resistance in animal and human medicine. The latter is problematic in both consequentialist and anthropocentric theories. The long term effects thereof seem disproportionate compared to the limited positive effects of veal production. We conclude that intensive veal production as it is currently known, is highly debatable from an ethical point of view.","[Aerts, S.] Odisee Univ Coll, Ethol & Anim Welf, Hosp Str 23, B-9100 St Niklaas, Belgium; [Dewulf, J.] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Obstet Reprod & Herd Hlth, Salisburylaan 133 D4, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium",Ghent University,"Aerts, S (通讯作者)，Odisee Univ Coll, Ethol & Anim Welf, Hosp Str 23, B-9100 St Niklaas, Belgium.",stef.aerts@odisee.be,"Dewulf, jeroen/AAJ-1580-2020; DEWULF, JEROEN/IYJ-8900-2023","DEWULF, JEROEN/0000-0001-9843-5990; Aerts, Stef/0000-0001-9049-4419",,,,,17,0,0,1,4,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,87,92,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_11,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000011,0

This requires a new level of flexibility both, for VET institutions and respective public administrations, as modem and competitive training programs need to be offered to various target groups - students, the employed and unemployed population. This obliges the VET institutions also to strengthen their entrepreneurship capacity which is a new challenge for many of them. The aim of the study is to analyse the former opinions of regional public administrators regarding challenges and need for innovative VET developments. Based on this, conclusions have been drawn regarding the compliance of the identified challenges during the time of the survey and the further systemic developments - identified via desk research - that have been implemented to address the challenges. Methods applied in the current paper: analysis of scientific publications, survey of public administrators. For the analysis of the surveys data - descriptive statistical analysis, cross tabulations, Mann-Whitney U test, as well as multivariate statistical analysis method - factor analysis have been applied. In the survey questionnaire for most of the questions the evaluation the scale 1 - 10 was applied to evaluate the attitude of the respondents, where 1 -not significant, 10 - very significant. The research shows that the opinions of regional public administrators represent their foresight ability and understanding of modern labour market developments and the role of VET institutions in the process.

The investigation of linkages in the currency market is more complicated than it is in the case of capital markets. The reason for this is that the analysis of co-movement between two currencies requires the consideration of exchange rates which are always calculated against a third currency. The choice of this third currency certainly influences the results of comparison. There prevails an opinion that the pattern of the co-movement in the currency market is significantly driven by the relative influence of the global currencies, mostly the US dollar and the euro, but to some degree also by the British pound and the Japanese yen. In the paper, we examine the dynamics of strength and areas of this influence in the global currency market during the period 2011-2018. We pay special attention to the changes in the pattern caused by the European debt crisis and the UK decision about Brexit. The dynamics of the linkages is modeled by means of Markov regime switching copula models, and the strength of the linkages is described using dynamic Spearman's rho coefficients and the dynamic coefficients of tail dependence.","[Doman, Malgorzata] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Elect Econ, Dept Appl Math, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland; [Doman, Ryszard] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Lab Financial Econometr, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Doman, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Fac Informat & Elect Econ, Dept Appl Math, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",malgorzata.doman@ue.poznan.pl; rydoman@amu.edu.pl,,"Doman, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1868-7993",,,,,14,0,0,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,94,101,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800011,0

The research questions were investigated in a quantitative online survey with 351 predominantly student participants. Based on the nine correlated relationship dimensions in Lorenz' approach, four independent dimensions characterizing consumer brand relationships (e, g. emotional connection and satisfaction) could be derived, Cluster analysis resulted in four types of relationships that showed parallels to Lorenz' relationship types.

The statistical data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, over the five years period, clearly indicate the permanent presence of establishment and deletion of companies where public notaries play a significant role in the preparation and drafting of documents that are the basis of the registration and deletion of companies in the court register, and are also a legal guarantee of the safety of procedure. This constant, experience, and legal safety assurance argue that public notaries continue to participate even more in the procedures of founding and all changes taking place in companies, Continuing investments in the computerization of the notary public service provide a niche for keeping, in addition to the existing one, and new electronic registers whose keeping requires data security to be guaranteed.

It was generally accepted that Kant's view of food is linked with Bodily Pleasures, as hinted at in the passage on good living, one of the primary purposes of food is to supply physical satisfaction. Recent interpreters try to defend Kant's view on food in several disciplines (psychology, environment, biology), these interpretations I will argue do fully grasp the essence of Kant's humanity. Kant in fact identifies the ability to choose between different kinds of foods as one of the specific features of humanity. This work will provide the most sophisticated account of food in Kant's ethics and introduces the mechanism of the 'the mean' to determine ethical conduct in Kant's humanity. I will argue there are two points to dispute the physical satisfaction charge: first, there are no universal rules that guide its realization. Humanity choice requires tastes in food and drink vary amongst people. The second point, more precisely, the excessive ingestion of food or drink, which leads to a significant weakening or a loss of the capacity to use one's powers, goes against the Kant's explanation of duties to the self.","[Guo, Y.] Munster Univ, Philosophy Dept, Paulus Str 14, D-33428 Harsewinkel, Germany",,"Guo, Y (通讯作者)，Munster Univ, Philosophy Dept, Paulus Str 14, D-33428 Harsewinkel, Germany.",121684092@qq.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,526,530,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_84,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000084,0

I apply the method in the PNAD, a nationwide representative Brazilian cross-sectional dataset for the years 2001-2009. The results indicate that the size of the informal sector is increased by around 39% compared to what would prevail in the absence of the minimum wage, an effect attributable to (i) unemployment effects of the minimum wage on the formal sector and (ii) movements of workers from the formal to the informal sector as a response to the policy.","[Jales, Hugo] Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Jales, Hugo] Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY USA",,"Jales, H (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13202 USA.",hbjales@syr.edu,,,,,,,14,18,24,3,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

The current external macro-financial environment is complicated by the slowdown in the growth of the global economy. Also, this period of uncertainty is further shortened by the global geopolitical situation. That is why the financial sector should be able to adapt to these changes and maintain effective competitiveness. The relevance of the chosen topic can be explained by the fact that the main goal of any business is winning the competition. Triumph over an opponent is the result of continuous and competent work of the banks. The external policy of the bank and the services offered directly affect the competitiveness. This paper examines several competitiveness indicators. The first is the profit margin. The purpose of any business is to maximize the profit. With their profits banks develop and improve the quality of banking services, by increasing the level of competitiveness. The second indicator is the growth of own capital, which ensures the stability of the bank's financial position and the liquidity of the balance sheet. The own capital amount determines the bank's ability to remain stable during a crisis. The third indicator is the bank's assets, which show the use of bank resources. The bank's assets consist of their own and attracted resources, which are used to make a profit, to maintain liquidity and ensure the bank's efficiency. The bank's prosperity depends on reliable investors and borrowers. Banks are struggling for such clients to maintain a level of competitiveness. That is why the amount of deposits and credits is examined in this paper. Several methods are used to conduct the competitiveness analysis in the Baltic States' banking sector.

Its constraints or obstacles are mainly manifested in the traditional aspects of the direction of the scene and the individual's ability to form some kind of constraints. In the context of new media, cultural diversity and intercultural communication inspire communicators have a strong desire to communicate.

The spatial patterns differ markedly by marital status and the presence of children. For married mothers, the spatial clusters of low participation and regular employment rates are largely located in the inner suburbs, many of which overlap with the spatial clusters of long male commute times. The spatial regression results indicate that for married mothers, a longer commute time is significantly associated with lower participation and regular employment rates, while for unmarried and childless married women, these associations are mostly nonsignificant. Among married mothers, the magnitude of the negative associations is greater for college graduates than for those with a high school education or less, suggesting that highly educated mothers are especially sensitive to commute times. We argue that the spatial transportation constraint intensifies the household division of labor, resulting in unique patterns for married mothers.","[Kawabata, Mizuki] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Abe, Yukiko] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",Keio University; Hokkaido University,"Kawabata, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",mizuki@econ.keio.ac.jp,"Kawabata, Mizuki/Z-2931-2019","Kawabata, Mizuki/0000-0003-3285-6295","JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K13363, JP26590045, JP15H03358]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K13363, 15H03358] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grand Numbers JP16K13363, JP26590045, and JP15H03358.

It forces the refinement of legal frameworks and a constant effort for its harmonization at least at a European level. However, the Consumer Empowerment Index indicates certain problems which seem to be more dramatic for the younger member states such as Bulgaria. Particularly alarming is the score on awareness of consumer legislation and consumer skills which might be a reason for the low relative share of consumers online. Nevertheless, this issue is not well examined as existing existing prior researches in this field are scarce or outdated. This article points on the reasons for the low consumer empowerment of Bulgarians and its impact on e-commerce growth by focusing on the online consumer behaviour of young people aged 18-25. The main research aim is to evaluate the impact that the unawareness of consumer rights has on consumer behaviour and especially on the process of purchase decision making. The research methods used include a content analysis of the official information published by a range of online shops in order to detect the scale of the existing information asymmetry and an online survey which aims at assessing the level of legal awareness of Bulgarian youngsters. A correlation analysis is performed in order to track its impact on online purchase and after sale decisions. The legal framework is analysed with regard to recent changes and the applicability of European low. The issues of reinforcing consumers' knowledge about their rights in a digital environment are raised and discussed. Further research can include testing the effectiveness of different techniques for fostering consumer empowerment as well as making a comparative study on a cross-national basis.","[Kraleva, Vanya; Dimitrova, Ivayla] Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Kraleva, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Varna, Varna, Bulgaria.",,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,348,357,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500032,0

Based on three nationwide surveys from various years, the present article seeks to measure this shift and explore its underlying factors and mechanisms. My analysis reveals considerable changes in ethnolinguistic identifications, practices of language use, and preferences regarding language policies of the state, which can be seen as a kind of bottom-up de-Russification, a popular drift away from Russianness. At the same time, I demonstrate that changes in identifications by nationality and native language are related to changes in the perceptions of these categories; that is, that they should be conceptualized as measuring people's perceived belonging to both ethnic groups and civic nations. In other words, as people are shedding their Russianness in favor of Ukrainianness, they are also changing the meaning of being Ukrainian.","[Kulyk, Volodymyr] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Polit & Ethn Studies, Kiev, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Kuras Institute of Political & Ethnic Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,"Kulyk, V (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Polit & Ethn Studies, Kiev, Ukraine.",v_kulyk@hotmail.com,"Kulyk, Volodymyr/AAR-9452-2020; Kuras Institute of Political and Ethnic Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Institut politicnih i etnonacional'nih doslidzen' im.

The giving in payment, as matter of principle, involves risk-sharing between debtor and creditor, if the debtor is unable to pay, by giving up the property, with the consequence that the debt is discharged. Therefore, the debtor must be in a situation of inability to pay. Although art. 4 of Law no. 77/2016 regulates the conditions for the establishment of the right to settle the claim arising from a credit agreement and its accessories by the giving in payment of the immovable property, as a result of the Constitutional Court Decision no. 623/2016, the law can no longer be applied without making a distinction between debtors acting in good faith and those acting in bad faith. It remains to be seen how the courts will find the most adequate and correct variants of harmonization of the hardship mechanism with the specificity of the forced giving in payment, as well as the general rules of giving in payment provided for by the Civil Code. Meanwhile, the notion of risk applicable to banking business seems to leave its wellknown path in the credit contracts and face a legalization process to protect the consumer's rights. In analyzing this phenomenon our article will also focus on the analysis of risk sharing, the EU Regulation no 575/2013, the National Bank regulations concerning credit risks and the relevant Court of Justice of the European Union case law.","[Macovei, Codrin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Macovei, C (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",mcodrin@uaic.ro,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-492-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,131,146,,,,,,16,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL8FU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000456271700009,0

I will offer four reasons to support this claim. First, I will argue that insect sentience does not automatically imply a right to life. Second, I will offer some reasons to believe that insect consciousness may matter less than that of other animals, who might have a stronger claim to moral protection. Third, I will argue that a commitment not to harm other types of animals, such as mammals, may actually imply an obligation to consume insects.

The results of the research: to build a model for analysis of the investment potential of the construction sector (IPCS) at the first stage, a selection of formalized factors was made, which were significant from the point of view of its growth, while modeling the IP as the initial characteristic of the model considered the growth rate of capital investments. In the second stage, the three-factor Cobb-Douglas production function was selected for the IPCS study; in the third stage, the necessary statistical information is collected; at the fourth stage calculations were made, including: a functional dependence was constructed, allowing to analyze the effect of changing the value of one of the selected factors on the resulting factor. Conclusions: the conducted studies showed that market participants, investors can use the proposed methodology to determine the factors that influence the improvement of IPCS, the degree of their influence, the determination of the values necessary to achieve a given level of investment potential.

In total, 437 students from two faculties from the University of Rijeka, Croatia participated in the research. Dutch Test for Conflict Handling (DUTCH) was used to measure students' conflict management preferences. The results showed that students of both majors used strategies of compromising and problem solving the most. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed the main effect of the study program on the students' preferences for compromising. It was found that the students of psychology reported using compromising more often than the students of economics and business. The interaction of the study program and the study progress on compromising was also significant. It was found that the seniors of psychology preferred compromising significantly more than the seniors of economics and business. Another ANOVA showed that the main effects of the study program and the study progress on forcing were significant with no interaction: preferences for forcing were higher among senior students than among freshmen as well as among the students of economics and business than among the students of psychology. The results provide guidelines for the future design of study programs relative to the needs of the labor market and social needs for integrative solutions and inclusiveness. Despite the validity of our findings, the results cannot serve as an accurate predictor of the student behavior in the workplace. It is possible that college students would use a combination of conflict management strategies once they enter the workforce. In addition, our results are based on self-report data. That is why we suggest that future studies include experimental design as a more accurate way of data collection.","[Rupcic, Natasa] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Svegar, Domagoj] Univ Rijeka, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Rupcic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",natasa.rupcic@efri.hr; domagoj.svegar@uniri.hr,"Rupcic, Natasa/R-4488-2018","Rupcic, Natasa/0000-0002-9915-8881",,,,,48,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,244,263,,,,,,20,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300014,0

This article explores why this policy form has gained such wide popularity in the context of fiscal austerity and greater financialisation of social policy. It argues ICLs act as a policy hybrid, combining elements of a tax and a loan. The article traces the development of ICLs in their original and most developed context, Australia's university sector. We connect the development of ICLs to changes in modes of state accounting associated with the application of private sector accounting techniques. These changes reflect financialisation inside the state, producing contradictory political dynamics. Drawing on Streeck's conception of a shift from the tax state' to the debt state', we argue the hybrid construction of ICLs creates political tendencies in both directions, facilitating greater state discretion while also implementing market discipline. Alongside these contradictory state imperatives we highlight continued partisanship, pointing to new and ongoing forms of distributive politics. To the extent that accounting technologies allow the state to act as a special kind of creditor, we ask whether financialisation may also involve the emergence of an asset state'.","[Spies-Butcher, Ben] Macquarie Univ, Sociol Dept, Econ & Soc, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bryant, Gareth] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Sydney,"Spies-Butcher, B (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Sociol Dept, Econ & Soc, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",ben.spies-butcher@mq.edu.au,,"Spies-Butcher, Benjamin/0000-0002-0427-5082; Bryant, Gareth/0000-0002-6987-2291",,,,,107,9,9,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Today, e-marketing is seen as a support to marketing as a whole, However, it is enjoying increasing importance in the marketing activity of business entities generally The basic goal of e-marketing is to, attract, satisfy and keep a customer surfing the Internet in the long term, Internet and digital technology have changed the nature of marketing. Electronic business improves relationships, and allows businesses to focus more on their customers. Through modern communication channels, Political entities have been implementing the e-marketing process whilst at the same time perfecting the end product with the purpose of achieving their goal - that is winning elections. By using e-marketing tools, political entities are able to communicate throughout the campaign with all those with an Internet connection. This paper presents the results of research aimed at identifying the influence of e-marketing on voters. Those analysed were voters from the IV and VIII constituency during the electoral campaign for the Croatian Parliament in 2016., The aim of the analysis is to determine the influence on decision-making on the choice of parties and candidates of a particular age-group of voters, identifying the role of social networks, and which age group is more influenced by internet media in the selection of parties and candidates. The main research objective is to determine to what extent and in which way the political parties and candidates in the campaign for early parliamentary elections in 2016 used e-marketing for political marketing purposes and what impact it had on voters' decisions. It was concluded that political entities in the Republic of Croatia did not use e-marketing potential and that e-marketing does not influence voters significantly. From a scientific point of view, the influence of e-marketing in a political campaign hasn't gained adequate attention. This research will contribute to the better understanding of applying e-marketing to an electoral campaign. The results could be used to improve political e-marketing but also as a framework for further research.","[Stilin, Zarko; Mesic, Jasen; Ruzic, Ivan] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Stilin, Z (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",zarko.stilin@gmail.com; jasen.mesic@mvep.hr; ivanruzic777@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1244,1257,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300067,0

This raises the question of actual unethical behaviour by students and their intention for future behaviour, and to what extent and in what way does perceived behavioural control has an effect. Modern technology facilitates and increases the likelihood of unethical behaviour by students and facilitates the performance of unethical behaviour itself. Therefore, this paper emphasizes the perceived behavioural control of students in higher education. The research was conducted on a sample of 622 university students. The goal of the paper is to determine to what extent does perceived behavioural control affect the actual student behaviour and their intention to behave unethically in higher education, by applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used in the paper. The results of the correlation analysis have shown that there is a statistically significant correlation between the perceived behavioural control and the intention to behave unethically, as well as the current (actual) student behaviour.

Current rents and privileges also deter the elite from implementing serious political reforms, leading to a trap that prevents the completion of the transition process.","[Szekely-Doby, Andras] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Comparat & Inst Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Székely-Doby, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Comparat & Inst Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",andras.szekely-doby@uni-corvinus.hu,"Székely-Doby, András/AAD-8541-2019; András, Székely-Doby/JDC-9416-2023","Szekely-Doby, Andras/0000-0002-8696-1317",,,,,69,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,2,,,,,277,296,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1439453,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FY7OT,,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427053100006,0

This paper seeks to identify the most critical factors in traditional retail related to service quality that will ensure competitiveness, survival and business success in the future. This research was applied to customers from traditional retail stores in the Centre of Portugal. Tangibility, assurance, empathy, reliability and responsiveness (Service Quality dimensions), brand image, customer satisfaction and loyalty to the traditional trade were the variables considered for this study. A multi-level and hierarchical model was used as a framework to identify and capture the links between customer satisfaction, service quality, brand image and loyalty of customers in the Portuguese traditional trade. The results revealed that service quality is the main determinant of customer satisfaction and corporate image. Furthermore, customer satisfaction, corporate image and service quality significantly affect customer loyalty. This research is of particular significance to the literature in retail and to practitioners as well, since there are only a few studies in this topic applied to the Portuguese traditional retail.","[Veloso, Claudia Miranda] Univ Aveiro, Inst Polytech Braganca, ESTGA, GOVCOPP,UNIAG, Aveiro, Portugal; [Magueta, Daniel] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, Aveiro, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Humberto] Univ Aveiro, ESTGA, GOVCOPP, Aveiro, Portugal; [Alves, Sandra Raquel] Polytech Inst Leiria, CIC DIGITAL, Leiria, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Veloso, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, Inst Polytech Braganca, ESTGA, GOVCOPP,UNIAG, Aveiro, Portugal.",claudiamiranda@ipb.pt; dmagueta@ua.pt; humberto@alumni.dmu.ac.uk; raquel.alves@ipleiria.pt,"Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/W-4239-2017; Magueta, Daniel/IZE-2692-2023; Magueta, Daniel/IUO-5890-2023; Ribeiro, Humberto/AAJ-9053-2020","Veloso, Cláudia Miranda/0000-0001-6612-0580; Magueta, Daniel/0000-0003-4486-0806; Ribeiro, Humberto/0000-0003-4747-1048","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540]; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia","research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy - FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was financially supported by the research unit on Governance, Competitiveness and Public Policy (project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-008540), funded by FEDER funds through COMPETE2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade & Internacionalizacao (POCI) - and by national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia & a Tecnologia.",,63,4,4,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,497,511,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300048,0

I combine annual data from the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database and the Anglo African Trade Statistics to estimate a Vector Error Correction Model of the 18th century British slave trade that captures four versions of the Gun-Slave Hypothesis: guns-for-slaves-in-exchange, guns-for-slaves-in-production, slaves-for-guns-derived and the gun-slave cycle. Three econometric results emerge. (1) Gunpowder imports and slave exports were co-integrated in a long-run equilibrium relationship. (2) Positive deviations from equilibrium gunpowder produced additional slave exports. This guns-for-slaves-in-production result survives 17 placebo tests that replace gunpowder with non-lethal commodities imports. It is also confirmed by an instrumental variables estimation that uses excess capacity in the British gunpowder industry as an instrument for gunpowder. (3) Additional slave exports attracted additional gunpowder imports for 2-3 more years. Together these dynamics formed a gun-slave cycle. Impulse-response functions generate large increases in slave export in response to increases in gunpowder imports. I use these results to explain the growth of slave exports along the Guinea Coast of Africa in the 18th century. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Young and old individuals vote over the size of a social long term care transfer (LTC hereafter) program, which children complement with help in time or money to their dependent parent. Dependent parents have an intrinsic preference for help in time by family members. We first show that low (resp., high) income children provide help in time (resp. in money), whose amount is decreasing (resp. increasing) with the child's income. The middle income class may give no family help at all, and its elderly members would be the main beneficiaries of the introduction of social LTC transfers. We then provide several reasons for the stylized fact that there are little social LTC transfers in most countries. First, social transfers are dominated by help in time by the family when the intrinsic preference of dependent parents for the latter is large enough. Second, when the probability of becoming dependent is lower than one third, the children of autonomous parents are numerous enough to oppose democratically the introduction of social LTC transfers. Third, even when none of the first two conditions is satisfied, the majority voting equilibrium may entail no social transfers, especially if the probability of becoming dependent when old is not far above one third. This equilibrium may be local (meaning that it would be defeated by the introduction of a sufficiently large social program). This local majority equilibrium may be empirically relevant whenever new programs have to be introduced at a low scale before being eventually ramped up.","[De Donder, Philippe] Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, ESG, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, ESG, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",philippe.dedonder@tse-fr.eu; leroux.marie-louise@uqam.ca,,,Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR,Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR,"The authors thanks participants to the 55th SCSE annual congress in Montreal, CORE 50th anniversary conference as well as E.

A key research question for this paper is to what extent there is a trade-off between long term capital expenditure and short term operating cost. The results suggest that BRT systems located in developing countries or countries that have high population densities are successful in generating higher revenues per passenger and unit of input than their conventional bus counterparts but are from a community perspective not more cost effective in doing so. Better BRT standards and hence higher capital expenditure, while significantly increasing patronage and input effectiveness do not have a significant impact on either yields or cost effectiveness. In contrast, public ownership and the number of stations are on average associated with higher cost effectiveness scores.","[Merkert, Rico; Mulley, Corinne; Hakim, Md Mahbubul] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Merkert, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rico.merkert@sydney.edu.au,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022","Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269; Hakim, Dr Md Mahbubul/0000-0002-8079-3607; Merkert, Rico/0000-0001-9939-7199","Across Latitudes and Cultures - Bus Rapid Transit (ALC-BRT) Centre of Excellence for Bus Rapid Transit development, centred in Santiago, Chile; Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF)","Across Latitudes and Cultures - Bus Rapid Transit (ALC-BRT) Centre of Excellence for Bus Rapid Transit development, centred in Santiago, Chile; Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF)","The authors would like to thank the many managers from the analysed BRT firms and their associated agencies for providing the data and investing their time to support this research.

We provide robust estimates for the responsiveness of fuel consumption to changes in prices, which constitute a key determinant for emissions pathways in response to policy interventions. We show that accounting for the manifest shift to diesel in the European vehicle fleet, as well as slow consumption adjustments over time yield strong evidence that petrol and diesel demand are more price elastic already in the short run than previous studies suggest. In particular, we present evidence that diesel demand in Europe tends to be more price elastic than petrol demand, when instrumenting prices with excise taxes to account for endogeneity. Inspired by recent fuel tax reform proposals, we then show that both (i) a repeal of the preferential tax treatment for diesel and (ii) an introduction of a carbon content -based tax, could avoid considerable amounts of health damaging air pollutant exhaust while at the same time contributing substantially to achieving the EU climate policy goals for 2020. In many countries, abandoning the diesel tax advantage has nearly as strong an effect as a 50(sic)/tCO(2) tax on fuel. Both reforms have significant revenue potential.","[Zimmer, Anne] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Zimmer, Anne] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Str 17 Milli 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Koch, Nicolas] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Zimmer, A (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Zimmer, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Str 17 Milli 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",azimmer@pik-potsdam.de; Koch@mcc-berlin.net,,"Zimmer, Anne/0000-0003-1008-7157; Koch, Nicolas/0000-0002-7775-034X",,,,,71,24,24,1,43,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Against this backdrop, this paper uses a kth-order nonparametric quantile causality test, to analyse whether EPU and EMU predict stock returns and volatility. Based on daily data covering the period of 2 January 1986 to 8 December 2014, we find that, for oil returns, EPU and EMU have strong predictive power over the entire distribution barring regions around the median, but for volatility, the predictability virtually covers the entire distribution, with some exceptions in the tails. In other words, predictability based on measures of uncertainty is asymmetric over the distribution of oil returns and its volatility.","[Bekiros, Stelios] EUI, Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios; Gupta, Rangan] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",European University Institute; IPAG Business School; Eastern Mediterranean University; University of Pretoria,"Bekiros, S (通讯作者)，EUI, Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.;Bekiros, S (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; stelios.bekiros@eui.eu; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014; BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,17,211,215,5,49,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This has led us to research into employment thresholds -Verdoorn's law - and unemployment - Okun's law - from the perspective of the Spanish provinces. We use a spatial SUR model which allows us to link the panel data with analysis of spatial dependence in order to obtain efficient and robust results about the stability of the Verdoorn and Okun coefficients. We remove the spatial dependence by using spatial filtering techniques from the semiparametric method of vector decomposition. The results show that thresholds vary over time and the output growth required for a rise in employment is well below the level necessary to reduce the unemployment rate.,"[Buendia Azorin, Jose Daniel] Univ Murcia, Dept Appl Econ, Murcia, Spain; [Sanchez de la Vega, Maria del Mar] Univ Murcia, Dept Quantitat Methods Econ & Business, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia; University of Murcia,"Azorín, JDB (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Appl Econ, Murcia, Spain.",jdbuen@um.es; marvega@um.es,"Buendía Azorin, Jose Daniel/ACC-5864-2022","Buendía Azorin, Jose Daniel/0000-0001-9302-7971; Sanchez de la Vega, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-8647-6215",,,,,39,5,5,2,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

A number of articles in the last two decades have conjectured that this is because estimation of VARMAs is perceived to be challenging and proposed various ways to simplify it. Nevertheless, VARMAs continue to be largely dominated by VARs, particularly in terms of developing useful extensions. We address these computational challenges with a Bayesian approach. Specifically, we develop a Gibbs sampler for the basic VARMA, and demonstrate how it can be extended to models with time-varying vector moving average (VMA) coefficients and stochastic volatility. We illustrate the methodology through a macroeconomic forecasting exercise. We show that in a class of models with stochastic volatility, VARMAs produce better density forecasts than VARs, particularly for short forecast horizons.","[Chan, Joshua C.

These results also hold for the subsample of randomized experiments (RCTs). However, intervention impacts are highly heterogeneous: financial education is less effective for low-income clients as well as in low- and lower-middle-income economies. Specific behaviors, such as the handling of debt, are more difficult to influence and mandatory financial education tentatively appears to be less effective. Thus, intervention success depends crucially on increasing education intensity and offering financial education at a teachable moment.","[Kaiser, Tim] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Kaiser, Tim] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Berlin, Germany; [Menkhoff, Lukas] DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Dept Int Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Menkhoff, Lukas] Humboldt Univ, Econ, Berlin, Germany",University of Kiel; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Menkhoff, L (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, German Inst Econ Res, Dept Int Econ, Berlin, Germany.;Menkhoff, L (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Econ, Berlin, Germany.",tkaiser@diw.de; lmenkhoff@diw.de,"Kaiser, Tim/S-2024-2019","Kaiser, Tim/0000-0001-7942-6693",DFG [CRC TRR 190],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the authors who responded to our requests to provide their datasets or further details about their studies for their kind cooperation.

In this context we are faced with the question of how much time spent on commuting is optimal happiness wise, and what means of transportation. Since our personal experience is limited, it is helpful to draw on the experience of other people, of people like us in particular. Earlier research: Several cross-sectional studies have found lower subjective wellbeing among long-distance commuters and among users of public transportation. Yet these differences could be due to selection effects, such as unhappy people ending up more often in distant jobs without having a car. Still another limitation is that earlier research has focused on the average effect of commuting, rather than specifying what is optimal for whom. Method: Data of the Dutch 'GeluksWijzer' (Happiness Indicator) study were analyzed, in the context of which 5000 participants recorded both what they had done in the previous day and how happy they had felt during these activities. This data allows comparison between how the same person feels at home and during their commute. The number of participants is large enough to allow a split-up between different kinds of people, in particular among the many well-educated women who participated in this study. Results: People feel typically less well when commuting than at home, and this negative difference is largest when commuting using public transportation and smallest when commuting by bike. It is not per se the commuting time that depresses mood, but specific combinations of commuting time and commuting mode. Increasing commuting times can even lead to an uplift of mood when the commute is by bike or foot. Split-up by different kinds of people shows considerable differences, especially with regard to the different modes and company when travelling. Optimal ways of commuting for different kinds of people are presented in a summary table, from which individuals can read what will fit them best. The differences illustrate that research focusing on averages will not help individuals to make a more informed choice with respect to commuting mode.

In our model, firms own strategic real estate or lease generic real estate. Our model predicts that strategic real estate ownership is positively correlated with industry concentration and negatively related to demand uncertainty. Also, firm risk is higher for firms with more strategic real estate operating in a more concentrated market. This prediction arises because smaller investments induce greater market competition, which effectively eliminates the right tail of the firm's profit distribution. We provide strong empirical support for our predictions. In particular, firm value is more volatile in less competitive markets for a given level of demand uncertainty.","[Ambrose, Brent W.; Yoshida, Jiro] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Diop, Moussa] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ambrose, BW (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",bwa10@psu.edu; mdiop@bus.wisc.edu; jiro@psu.edu,"Ambrose, Brent/C-8531-2017; Yoshida, Jiro/AAF-5853-2020","Ambrose, Brent/0000-0001-5977-3663;",Penn State Institute for Real Estate Studies,Penn State Institute for Real Estate Studies,"We thank Dwight Jaffee, Fumio Hayashi, Tim Riddiough, Abdullah Yavas, Antonio Mello, David Feldman, the editor Sumit Agarwal, the anonymous referees and seminar participants at Penn State University, Hitotsubashi University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of California-Berkeley, the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Technology-Sydney, Australian National University, the HULM Conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Policy Research Institute at Japan Ministry of Finance, Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry and Research Institute for Capital Formation.

Results from the regression analysis indicate that airport dominance is the most important source of pricing power in the gradually deregulated Chinese domestic market. Hub carriers are able to charge higher prices to premium class passengers and non-hub carriers benefit from the umbrella effects of hub premiums. However, hub carriers are not able to translate their airport dominance to pricing power in the economy class market, whereas non-hub carriers even have to reduce the prices as their market shares at major airports increase. This study contributes to the literature by explicitly segmenting the market into economy and premium classes. The results have important policy implications in terms of further deregulation of Chinese domestic market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Caputo fractional derivative contains a non-integer differencing order, providing the same insight for persistence as emphasized in the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) time series models. We utilize the hybrid Phillips curve with memory to forecast US inflation during 1967-2014. The results indicate that our model performs well against a traditional hybrid Phillips curve, an integrated moving average model and a naive random walk model in quasi-in-sample forecasts. In out-of-sample forecasts based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, we find that the forecasting performance of Phillips curve models depends on the sample period. Our model with CPI data can outperform others in out-of-sample forecasts during and after the most recent financial crisis (2006-2014).","[Chu, Shiou-Yen] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan; [Shane, Christopher] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Chu, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.",ecdsyc@ccu.edu.tw,,"Chu, Shiou-Yen/0000-0002-6427-0451",,,,,41,2,2,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The approach is novel in its integration of space syntax measures to evaluate network accessibility and the use of volume area ratios to measure land use intensity. It utilises high-resolution geographic data surfaces for the generation of the built environment variables. The advantage of using this method is that it allows greater analytical flexibility in transport-policy and practice, where the ability to compare the analytical results to other social and spatial indicators is vital for decision-making. Pedestrian density data covering the whole of Greater London are used to test the performance of the variables. The best performing variables are then analysed to determine their weighting in a model of pedestrian demand for London based on the selected built environment indicators. Randomised testing shows that the model is capable of reliably predicting pedestrian demand. It can be used to estimate pedestrian demand both currently and for future scenarios by quantify future changes to the built environment, and thus enabling walking to be quantitatively assessed in the same way as motorised modes. The model can be applied to active travel infrastructure planning and policy evaluation, from the scale of the street or intersection, to larger administrative units. The model also has wider theoretical and policy implications that relate to the spatial structuring of London. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis uses statistical methods and a Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model calibrated with the neutral procedure. The PMP model compares the situation of the average olive farm in the baseline year with its position in a simulated year considering two policy scenarios: 1) all production systems are under CAP green payments, 2) only organic and integrated systems are under CAP green payments. Simulations show that for scenario I there is no variation in the area under the different farming systems with respect to the baseline year, nor in the gross-margin-before-aid. Subsidies increase slightly because agricultural policy does not consider the reduction for modulation included in the baseline year. In contrast, in scenario II, areas under integrated and organic farming increase to the detriment of conventional farming. It can be concluded that the distribution rules for green payments set out in the new CAP do not incentivize the adoption of integrated and organic farming. However, alternative policy options, allowing the implementation in the olive sector of environmental measures equivalent to the green schemes implemented in annual crops, could bring about additional positive effects in terms of redistribution of aid from less to more environmentally friendly farming practices. This outcome would contribute to both better rewarding the public goods generated through this public aid and boosting the legitimacy of the CAP transfers.","[Mili, Samir; de Andres, Rosario] CSIC, Spanish Natl Res Council, IEGD, Madrid, Spain; [Judez, Lucinio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Economia, Geografia y Demografia (IEGD); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid","Mili, S (通讯作者)，CSIC, Spanish Natl Res Council, IEGD, Madrid, Spain.",samir.mili@csic.es,,"Mili, Samir/0000-0003-3835-9310",[ECO2015-64438-R],,This research work was carried out in the framework of the project: Synergies between agricultural and environmental policies aiming at the sustainability of Mediterranean agrosystems (ECO2015-64438-R).,,25,7,7,0,7,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2017,16.0,3,,,,,2,10,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FN8SR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416296300001,0

We apply two stage procedures to derive unpredicted weight gain and height growth in the first year of life. Our estimates show that a standard deviation (SD) increase in birth weight is associated with an increase of 0.14 (standard error [SE]: 0.03) in WAZ8 and 0.12 (SE: 0.02) in HAZ8. These are significantly lower than the corresponding figures for a SD increase in unpredicted weight gain: 0.51 (SE: 0.02) and 0.33 (SE: 0.02). The heterogeneity of the predictive power of early childhood nutrition indicators for mid-childhood outcomes reflects both life-cycle considerations (prenatal versus postnatal) and the choice of anthropometric measure (height versus weight). Even though all the nutritional indicators that involve postnatal nutritional status are important predictors for all the mid-childhood outcomes, there are some important differences between the indicators on weight and height. The magnitude of associations with the outcomes is one aspect of the heterogeneity. More importantly there is a component of height-forage z-score (at age 12 months) that adds predictive power for all the mid-childhood outcomes beyond that of birth weight and weight gain in the first year of life.

The transportation spot market is a mechanism by which unfulfilled and urgent demand is satisfied. Shipments are tendered one at a time on a load-by-load basis. Because of the often severe shortage of spot market capacity and its relatively high and volatile prices, shippers must actively as opposed to passively seek carrier capacity. Often, they turn to third parties. This research considers third party brokers (3PL, or non-asset carriers) operating in the spot market. On behalf of shippers, these brokers take responsibility for shipments and secure capacity for them. The paper proposes a behaviourally based conceptual framework that uses 3PL broker data to improve the search for capacity on the spot market. It seeks to improve the effectiveness of the search process by combining (1) broker data on the availability of carrier capacity, (2) a priori information on a particular carrier's likely response to various prices to service a load (the reservation price), and (3) the ability to source multiple loads simultaneously (bundling). These components are incorporated into a framework that enables brokers to better prioritize the carriers they contact, thereby improving outcomes in terms of lower carrier costs and reduced search effort.

They should be of particular benefit for resource-constrained small and/or independent hotel operations for whom accurate occupancy predictions facilitate a more targeted approach to strategic investments. Using the OECD indicators offers hoteliers an alternative to acquiring expensive data and/or consultant inputs. The article shows the merit of OECD composite indicators generally and of the consumer confidence index in particular as publicly available and reliable data which can provide hoteliers with early signals about shifting demand.

We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions for any rule defined on the single-peaked domain to be bribe-proof.

Furthermore, we examine how large a domain can be to allow for the existence of bribe-proof and symmetric rules and show that the convex domain is such a unique maximal domain.","[Wakayama, Takuma] Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan",Ryukoku University,"Wakayama, T (通讯作者)，Ryukoku Univ, Fac Econ, Fushimi Ku, 67 Tsukamoto Cho, Kyoto 6128577, Japan.",wakayama@econ.ryukoku.ac.jp,,,"KAKENHI [20730135, 22730165, 22330061, 25380244, 15H03328, 16K03567]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03567, 22330061, 15H03328, 22730165, 20730135] Funding Source: KAKEN","KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is a revised version of the manuscript entitled Bribe-proof division of a private good.

Using individual-level data from Japan, we compared the effect of height on marriages between men and women, and investigated how the effect of height on marriage has changed across generations. Our key findings are: (1) for men born before 1965, a 1% increase in height led to an approximately 0.56% increase in the probability of being married. Conversely, for women born before 1965, a 1% increase in height led to an approximately 0.56% decrease in the probability of being married. (2) For men born in or after 1965, a 1% increase in height led to an approximately 1.05% (0.18%) increase (decrease) in the probability of being married (divorced). However, the height effect was not present for women. Japan experienced astounding economic development after World War II, which resulted in changes in its economic and social structure. These changes may have also altered the role of height for Japanese men and women in the marriage market. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show: (1) the financial contagion phenomenon is the reason why some financial markets experienced almost corresponding reactions during the subprime crisis; (2) financial contagion reactions behave conspicuously in three particular phases during the subprime crisis; (3) financial contagion reactions have predictive functions for financial market changes and can provide indicators for risk management during crisis periods.","[Zhou, Wei] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Sch, Kunming 650221, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China",Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Sichuan University,"Zhou, W (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Int Business Sch, Kunming 650221, Peoples R China.;Zhou, W (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China.",zw453@163.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [71301141]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M570792, 2016T90864]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [13YJC630247]; Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Commission of Yunnan Province [2013FD029]; Science Foundation and Major Project of Educational Committee of Yunnan Province [2014Z100]; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [YB2015087]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Commission of Yunnan Province; Science Foundation and Major Project of Educational Committee of Yunnan Province; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Yunnan Province,"The author would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive suggestions that have led to this improved version of the paper.

We find that high-price retailers do not pass through changes in the import price. Pass-through rates for low-price retailers are 53 per cent within three months. Consequently, pass-through rates for low-income households are 58 per cent, significantly larger than those for high-income households. We then present one possible explanation for these observations in a theoretical model with endogenous vertical product differentiation due to bundling an ex ante homogeneous import goods with services. Following an import price change, retailers who sell a cheaper unbundled product change prices to a greater extent than retailers who sell a higher-priced bundle of product and service.","[Berner, Eike] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Birg, Laura] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Boddin, Dominik] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany",Deutsche Bank; University of Gottingen; University of Kiel,"Berner, E (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,32,3,4,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2017,40.0,7,,,,,1314,1344,,10.1111/twec.12432,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FA2RN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405288600003,0

However, many studies have emphasised an increasing erosion of the Mediterranean diet heritage, also in Italy. Starting from the assumption that evolution of human nutrition, if it occurs rapidly, can only be conceptualised as a social phenomenon, this study intends to explore the relationship between purchase behaviour for typical Mediterranean diet food and some socioeconomic and geographic characteristics of the Italian households. Italy's food purchase microdata in 2013 were used to describe three different purchasing behaviours among households and a multinomial logit model was applied to model nominal outcome variables in relationship with socioeconomic variables. Results suggest that families with older and more educated respondents have a higher probability to purchase Mediterranean diet food, while spending more on out-of-home eating or living far away from an urban area, seems to reduce this probability.","[Coderoni, Silvia] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Perito, Maria Angela] Univ Teramo, Fac Biosci & Agrofood & Environm Technol, Teramo, Italy; [Perito, Maria Angela] INRA, UR1303, ALISS, Ivry, France; [Cardillo, Concetta] Council Res Agr & Agr Econ Anal CREA, Ctr Policy & Bioecon, Rome, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; University of Teramo; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Perito, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Teramo, Fac Biosci & Agrofood & Environm Technol, Teramo, Italy.;Perito, MA (通讯作者)，INRA, UR1303, ALISS, Ivry, France.",,"Coderoni, Silvia/C-4740-2016","Coderoni, Silvia/0000-0001-8751-7376; Cardillo, Concetta/0000-0002-6190-5132",,,,,51,17,17,3,17,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2017,16.0,2,,,,,38,46,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FA2GI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405258400005,0

It builds upon the literature on aesthetic labour, which focuses largely on the role of physical appearance in employment relations, by shifting attention to its under-investigated auditory and aural dimensions. The results suggest that the managerial respondents actively discriminate in telephone-based job interviews against applicants speaking Chinese-, Mexican- and Indian-accented English, and all three are rated higher in non-customer-facing jobs than in customer-facing jobs. Job applicants who speak British-accented English, especially men, fare as well as, and at times better than, native candidates who speak American English.

The model uses a cointegration approach. The model parameters are estimated using data from the Santiago (Chile) bus system, where evasion has been measured at approximately 28%. The main results of the model are that (i) a 10% increase in the fare raises evasion by 2 percentage points and (ii) a 10% increase in inspections lowers evasion by 0.8 percentage points. An increase in unemployment, the third explanatory variable in the model, tends to induce a decrease in evasion, and vice versa. This counterintuitive finding may be explained by the fact that those most vulnerable to job loss, and more likely to evade than the average user due to economic necessity, tend to reduce their use of the bus system when unemployment rises and increase it when unemployment falls. Our results suggest a revision of the evasion control policy in Santiago to improve its effectiveness, and to link inspection efforts to fare increases or to decreases in unemployment.

The growth phase could be explained by the increased demand from emerging markets, while the subsequent stagnation may result from the crowding effect caused by the entry of numerous new varieties onto the wine market. The generalised model of ideal variety proposed by Hummels and Lugovskyy combines these two elements, and focusing on French exporters, we find partial support for this explanation at the world level. A 1 per cent increase in GDP per capita (income effect) generated an increase in price of 1.13 per cent between 2001 and 2011. In contrast, a 1 per cent increase in market size (competition effect) reduced prices by 1.10 per cent over the same period. This paper goes further into the analysis of these effects by considering wine exports according to the mode of transport used and indirectly evaluates economies of scale when wine is exported by land, sea or air (via a gravity equation). Economies of scale are observed for transport by plane and ship but not for road. A 10 per cent increase in the value of wine exported by road (plane) leads to a rise (reduction) in transport costs of 0.5 per cent (19 per cent).","[Candau, Fabien; Schlick, Julie] UPPA, CATT, Pau, France; [Deisting, Florent] Grp ESC Pau, Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Candau, F (通讯作者)，UPPA, CATT, Pau, France.",,,"Candau, Fabien/0000-0003-3989-1157; SCHLICK, Julie/0000-0002-5281-2647",,,,,44,4,4,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2017,40.0,5,,,,,963,977,,10.1111/twec.12446,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,ET9RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400644200007,0

We further investigate how critical policy parameters, such as capital requirements, prompt closure, and time of delay, relate to the MI premium by deriving a closed-form solution and evaluating its partial derivatives. The solutions show a negative cross effect of forbearance threshold and time delay on MI, indicating that a lower forbearance threshold and a longer period of time delay both expand their positive impacts on the price of MI. The numerical results show that an insurer's default risk premium can be substantial in the presence of a catastrophic risk in the housing price. For mortgage insurers with a lower asset-liability ratio, the effect of the interest rate risk on the MI premium is more obvious and noteworthy. Moreover, the forbearance threshold effect and capital requirements effect are more significant than the time delay effect on the MI premium.","[Chang, Chia-Chien] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Yu, Min-Teh] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Yu, MT (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan.",cchiac@kuas.edu.tw; mtyu@nctu.edu.tw,"Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021","Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327; Chang, ChiaChien/0000-0001-7094-7468",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [102-2410-H-009-007],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This study is based on research funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under grant #102-2410-H-009-007.

The analysis focuses on Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) that experience commuting flows with one or more neighboring state. A difference-in-differences-in-differences model compares PUMAs that experienced a sizeable increase or decrease in their cross-border minimum wage differential to those that experience smaller change in the cross-border differential. Out-of-state commuting of low wage workers (less than 10 dollars an hour) is then compared to that of moderate wage workers (10-13 dollars an hour). The results suggest that an increase in own state's minimum wage, relative to neighbor's, increases the frequency with which low-wage workers commute out of the state. The analysis is replicated on the subset of PUMAs that experience commuting flows with more than one neighboring state, so that the estimates are identified entirely within PUMA. As a whole, the results suggest that low-wage workers tend to commute away from minimum wage increases rather than towards them.","[McKinnish, Terra] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McKinnish, Terra] IZA, Durham, NC USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"McKinnish, T (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;McKinnish, T (通讯作者)，IZA, Durham, NC USA.",,,,,,,,23,12,18,2,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Around changes in the transport system, the majority of studies on inertia have relied on combining Revealed Preferences (RP) and Stated Preferences (SP) obtained prior to the introduction of new transport modes and measuring inertia as the effect that the real choices have on the choices in the hypothetical new scenarios. In this study, we analyze the role of the inertia using a novel panel data from the same set of individuals composed of two waves. The first wave was gathered before a new tram came into service and consisted of a RP survey and a SP survey which included the new public tram as a hypothetical alternative. The second wave consisted of a RP survey conducted two years later, after the tram started operating. Using these two waves, we estimate panel mixed logit models and found a significant inertia effect only between the RP waves which, having accounted for changes in other factors, increases the probability of choosing the car after the tram implementation. However, we did not find inertia effect on SP, hence taking into account only the RP-SP outcomes before tram might have led to wrong conclusions about the effect of the transport intervention on the modal share. Furthermore, we compare models with and without inertia effect and conclude that the models with inertia provide better fit to data, smaller direct car elasticities and increasing asymmetric effects between the car and public transport.

The paper has two main objectives. These are firstly to identify whether expected rates of return across different commercial real estate markets are positively spatially correlated and secondly to analyze the role of core markets like New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago in the information-spreading process. All the tests conducted are conditional on the maintained hypothesis that expected returns across different markets are spatially uncorrelated. To carry out these tests, we regress a measure of excess return in each of the 40 markets on (contemporaneous) measures of expected returns in other markets, controlling for the interaction between (neighboring) markets. We find very large spatial interaction coefficients across different markets. Our basic estimates yield a spatial correlation coefficient of near one and statistically significant at standard levels. Chow tests allow rejection of the hypothesis that core markets like New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago are no different than markets like Cleveland, Columbus, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, St. Louis, and Tampa in explaining the covariances of the rates of return among different commercial real estate markets. Tests of structural change also imply that core markets currently play a more prominent role that in the past in the transfer of information from one market to another.","[Shilling, James D.] Depaul Univ, Real Estate Ctr, 14 East Jackson Blvd,Suite 902, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Sirmans, C.

Large-scale companies and third-party logistics providers want the most economical and reliable forecasting mechanism for pricing the truckload spot market in the sphere of logistics and supply chains. This paper investigates the price forecasting of the truckload spot market, which is an important area for the determination of future value from the viewpoint of truckers by considering comprehensive variables. Two methodologies are used to determine truckers' spot price in the freight transport process, which are the artificial neural network and quantile regression, and a price forecasting framework is created. The framework is applied to two approaches: a route-based model and a general model in which all routes are considered together. Real data are used to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of the proposed method. In this scope forecast performances can be assessed, the best methodology and approach can be selected, and projections can be carried out. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We further investigate a possible explanation for this residual correlation by using some proxies for trading intensity derived from CFTC publicly available data, showing most notably that the proxy for speculation in the oil market increases the oil-gas correlation.

The GQ project upgraded the quality and width of 3,633 miles of roads in India. We use a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to compare non-nodal districts based upon their distance from the highway system. For the organized portion of the manufacturing sector, we find that GQ led to improvements in both urban and rural areas of nonnodal districts located 0-10 km from GQ. These higher entry rates and increases in plant productivity are not present in districts 10-50 km away. The entry effects are stronger in rural areas of districts, but the differences between urban and rural areas are modest relative to the overall effect. For the unorganized sector, we do not find material effects from the GQ upgrades in either setting. These findings suggest that in the time frames that we can consider-the first five to seven years during and after upgrades-the economic effects of major highway projects contribute modestly to the migration of the organized sector out of Indian cities but are unrelated to the increased urbanization of the unorganized sector.","[Ghani, Ejaz; Goswami, Arti Grover] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Goswami, Arti Grover; Kerr, William R.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kerr, William R.] Bank Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Kerr, William R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The World Bank; Harvard University; Bank of Finland; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ghani, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",Eghani@worldbank.org; agrover1@worldbank.org; wkerr@hbs.edu,,,Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries by the Centre or Economic Policy Research; World Bank,Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries by the Centre or Economic Policy Research; World Bank(The World Bank India),We are grateful to Stephen O'Connell and Hyoung Gun Wang for helpful suggestions/comments.

Australian consumers, on average, allocate about two-thirds of their income on food, housing, transport and recreation. We considered three demand models, the AIDS, Rotterdam and CBS demand systems, for estimation. The estimated income elasticities reveal that food, alcohol and tobacco, housing and medical care are necessities. All the own-price elasticities are negative and less than one in absolute value (except for recreation), indicating that demand for most goods is price inelastic. In addition, we tested the demand theory hypotheses, homogeneity, Slutsky symmetry and preference independence and found them to be acceptable.","[Wong, Lucille; Selvanathan, Eliyathamby A.; Selvanathan, Saroja] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ & Business Stat Discipline, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Selvanathan, S (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ & Business Stat Discipline, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.selvanathan@griffith.edu.au,,"Selvanathan, Eliyathamby A/0000-0001-6528-7995; Selvanathan, Saroja/0000-0002-4129-1727",,,,,36,4,4,2,8,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

It shows that job status insecurity is highly prevalent in the workforce and is associated with different individual, employment and labour market characteristics than those that affect insecurity about job loss. It is also related to different organizational contexts. However, the article also shows that the existence of effective mechanisms of employee participation can reduce both types of job insecurity.","[Gallie, Duncan] Univ Oxford, Sociol, Oxford, England; [Felstead, Alan] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Social Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Green, Francis] UCL Inst Educ, LLAKES Ctr, Work & Educ Econ, London, England; OECD Stat Directorate, Paris, France",University of Oxford; Cardiff University; University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Gallie, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",duncan.gallie@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Gallie, Duncan/V-2470-2019; Felstead, Alan R/H-8484-2012","Green, Francis/0000-0002-6786-5012; Inanc, Hande/0000-0002-2507-305X","ESRC/UKCES Strategic Partnership [RES-241-25-0001]; Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods; ESRC [ES/I03792X/1, ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019135/1, ES/I03792X/1] Funding Source: researchfish","ESRC/UKCES Strategic Partnership(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The Skills and Employment Survey 2012 was funded by the ESRC/UKCES Strategic Partnership (RES-241-25-0001), with additional support from the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods.",,34,142,154,4,62,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, when governments are too weak to regulate and effectively control them, domestic business elites may also cause political risk. In the literature on political risk, the host state is mostly modelled as a single, cohesive actor and elites outside of the government are not taken into account. By contrast, this paper conceptualises political risk as a lack of government assertiveness vis-a-vis domestic business elites, drawing on the limited access order (LAO) concept developed by Douglass North and his co-authors. It presents the case of Swedish Tele2's investment in Russia. The mobile telecommunications provider was highly successful in Russia until it became a threat to the business interests of three Russian oligarchs. Regulatory agencies in Russia lacked the necessary authority to provide a level playing field in the telecommunications industry. They did not intervene when Tele2's access to vital licenses was blocked by competitors, effectively squeezing the Swedes out of the Russian market. This paper concludes that in LAOs foreign investors are initially welcome, but political risk is high when the market competition with domestic elites becomes intense.","[Kluge, Janis Nikolaus] Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, Witten, Germany",Witten Herdecke University,"Kluge, JN (通讯作者)，Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, Witten, Germany.",janis.kluge@uni-wh.de,,,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01UC1413E]; Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung; Dorothee-Wilms Stiftung,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung; Dorothee-Wilms Stiftung,"This work was supported by Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [grant number 01UC1413E], Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung and Dorothee-Wilms Stiftung.",,102,15,16,1,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Apart from descriptive statistics and parametric tests, before and after statistical evaluation utilizing Empirical Bayes (EB) was used to estimate the cable barriers Safety Effectiveness. The findings from the descriptive statistics, paired t-test and EB evaluation were very similar which reinforces the positive safety effectiveness performances of the cable barriers in Tennessee. The study found that the statewide cable barriers Safety Effectiveness (statistical percentage change in crash frequency across all statewide cable barrier segments) for fatal crashes is 94%, incapacitating injury crashes is 92% and fatal and incapacitating injury crashes combined is also 92%. The safety effectiveness for fatal and all injury crashes combined was found to be 85%. In a direct comparison through descriptive statistics, statewide fatal crashes were reduced by 82% after the cable barriers installation while the incapacitating injury crashes were reduced by 76%. In addition, head-on crashes went down by 96% and crashes involving two or more vehicles went down by 92%. Fatalities due to median crossover crashes were reduced by 83% while number of people injured went down by 71% as a result of cable barriers. Through modeling, wider cable offsets and inside shoulders were found to help reduce number of median related crashes while high differential elevations and high posted speed limit segments significantly had higher number of crashes compared to the opposite features. The findings can be used by state transportation agencies as a decision tool when considering installation of median cable barriers as well in determination geometry and traffic factors that play role in enhancing or worsening performance of the median cable barriers.

New developmentalism has been described as a hybrid approach to development. It combines liberal practices of privatization and export orientation with state intervention to achieve social inclusion and economic development. Academic and policy literatures have repeatedly debated the conditions under which development takes place and have particularly focused on the role of the state. So far, discussions have predominantly concentrated on economic developments. We focus on the trajectories of new developmentalism in three strategic sectors in the Brazilian economy: oil, mining and steel, with particular emphasis on the steel industry. We contribute to the debate by paying equal attention to economic and social outcomes in these three sectors. We conclude that new developmentalism is sectorally specific. In the extractive sectors, export competitiveness translates into high wages. In steel, in contrast, new developmentalism brings economic benefits to some but social benefits to few. Thus, it is a paradigm of development but it is not wholly developmental.","[Doering, Heike] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Int Management, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Pereira dos Santos, Rodrigo Salles] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, IFCS, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Pocher, Eva] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Cardiff University; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; University of Glasgow,"Döring, H (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Int Management, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",DoeringH@cardiff.ac.uk; rodrigosantossp@gmail.com; Eva.Pocher@glasgow.ac.uk,"Santos, Rodrigo Salles Pereira dos/M-7696-2019; Santos, Rodrigo S P/C-5590-2013","Santos, Rodrigo Salles Pereira dos/0000-0003-3640-3365; Pocher, Eva/0000-0002-9814-3864",,,,,74,6,9,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The capital expenditure expansion will be funded in part by increased public debt, prompting the government to raise the annual budget deficit ceiling to three percent of GDP. With this development, this paper examines the long run and causal relationship between economic growth and public debt in the Philippines so as to better assess the potential impact of the recent policy initiative. Time series data from 1986 to 2015 were analyzed using the ADF unit root test, Johansen co-integration test, vector error correction model (VECM), and Granger causality technique. The study reveals that there is a long run equilibrium relationship between economic growth, domestic debt and external debt. In particular, external debt has a statistically significant positive impact on economic growth, whereas domestic debt has a statistically significant negative impact on growth in the long run. However, in the short run, only external debt Granger-causes economic growth, indicating a unidirectional causality. There is likewise no significant short run causal relationship between domestic debt and real GDP for both directions. These findings bolster the need for government to continue implementing sound fiscal and prudent debt management policies in order to maximize the positive impact of external debt on economic performance and to mitigate as well the possible adverse effect of domestic debt on growth.","[Duran, Manuel Gerardo G.] Univ Philippines, Diliman Extens Program Pampanga, Quezon City, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Duran, MGG (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Diliman Extens Program Pampanga, Quezon City, Philippines.",,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,267,280,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000027,0

We rely on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation methodology applied with non-informative priors, which produces estimates equivalent to those from (quasi-) maximum likelihood. We explore station-level pricing behavior using pairs of proximately situated fueling stations with no nearby neighbors. Our sample data represents average daily diesel and e5 fuel prices, and refinery cost information covering more than 487 days. The heterogeneous coefficients spatial autoregressive panel data model uses the large sample of daily time periods to produce spatial autoregressive model estimates for each fueling station. These estimates provide information regarding the price reaction function of each station to its duopoly rival station. This is in contrast to conventional estimates of price reaction functions that average over the entire cross-sectional sample of stations. We show how these estimates can be used to infer competition versus cooperation in price setting by individual stations.","[LeSage, James P.; Chih, Yao-Yu] Texas State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Vance, Colin] Rheinisch Westfl Wirtschaftsforsch eV RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Vance, Colin] Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; Jacobs University,"LeSage, JP (通讯作者)，Texas State Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",james.lesage@txstate.edu; Colin.Vance@rwi-essen.de,,,Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 823],Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of German Research Foundation (DFG),"Colin Vance has been partly supported by the Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes (SFB 823) of the German Research Foundation (DFG), within the framework of Project A3, Dynamic Technology Modeling.",,29,19,20,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Thus, each year millions of women in Sub-Saharan Africa give birth to a large number of children who die at birth because of food shortage which automatically generates brain damage and motor impairments. In sub-Saharan African countries, 500 000 mothers die every year during childbirth, most of them by prolonged lack of food during pregnancy. Like undernourishment, malnutrition usually affects the children of underdeveloped countries who live mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, authorities intervene only rarely by setting up some treatments to alleviate the suffering of children. The World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are bodies associated with the United states, who consider the right to food as vital and essential. Behind these organizations, there are large private transcontinental companies controlling several areas of activity such as production, distribution, etc.. and, thus, have power over the exercise of the right to food. These companies generally have greater financial resources than those of most countries in which they operate and produce very large gains. The same companies provide transportation, insurance and distribution of food goods, a fact which allows them to control the entire production process and makes of each one of these companies a monopoly in its activity sector to behave consequently against the right to food. For these private transcontinental companies, hunger is a scandalous phenomenon which will not be eliminated unless two conditions are met: the first one is related to a strong industrialization with a maximum capital and most advanced technologies as well as the elimination of family farms and food wastage; the second one is relative to the full liberalization of the market. The latter is sinequanone to defeat the scourge of hunger since a fully liberalized market will enable a free and adequate food, while this remains impossible as long as natural disasters may arise.

In order to better understand the geoeconomy of malnutrition, we will delve into the origins of underdevelopment in sub-Saharan Africa. Then, we will analyse the geo-economic dimension of hunger in Africa in order to deal with, in a third section, the illusion of biofuel and the threats it poses to poor countries in general and subSaharan African countries in particular.","[Nechad, Abdelhamid] Abdelmalek ESSAADI, ENCGT, Tetouan, Morocco; [Daghri, Taoufik] Mohammed V Univ, FSJESS, Rabat, Morocco",Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan; Mohammed V University in Rabat,"Nechad, A (通讯作者)，Abdelmalek ESSAADI, ENCGT, Tetouan, Morocco.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,1,9,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000001,0

So far, the attention of Latvian researchers has mostly been devoted to the so-called ratings of separate political institutions and politicians, but no attempt has been undertaken to investigate the political system as a whole through the prism of legitimacy. The aim of the present article is to explore whether there is a sufficient resource of legitimacy of the Latvian political system in order to provide stability and efficiency of the regime. The empirical basis of the research mostly consists of the results of the sociological research conducted in Latvia during the past six years (2011-2016). The data analysis of the present research is based on David Easton and Pippa Norris' conceptual approach to the study of legitimacy of political systems. One of the conclusions that can be made is that the political system of Latvia is characterised by insufficient diffuse support, which then indicates that the political system experiences the problem of legitimacy. As there is a divided society in Latvia, both communities lack a shared national identity, which could connect the society. In addition, it can be stated that around half of the society is not satisfied with the functioning of the political regime. The analysis performed in the article allows concluding that the trust in political institutions is extremely low and the assessment of the political authority performance is highly negative.","[Ozolzile, Gunars] Rigas Tehniska Univ, Riga, Latvia",,"Ozolzile, G (通讯作者)，Rigas Tehniska Univ, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,315,329,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2246,0.0,,,15,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200028,0

This objective is achieved in two stages. During the first one, using PCA, we describe the distribution of energy sources in 26 EU countries in 1995. We find four main principal components distinguishing countries in terms of energy source consumption in 1995, and then, during the second stage, use them as potential determinants of renewable energy development. We also consider several factors related to energy security, environmental concerns, economy and politics. Applying two methods of variable selection, namely, the best subset regression and the lasso method, we demonstrate that the present (in 2014) share of RES in the energy mix significantly depends on the condition of the EU countries in the middle of 1990s. Our study reveals that the distribution of energy sources in 1995 is the main determinant of renewable energy development. Countries without their own fossil fuel sources are the ones with the greatest development of renewable energy. Other factors affecting RE development include: GDP per capita, the Shannon Wiener index (SWI) reflecting the concentration of energy supply, and the cost of the consumption of energy obtained from fossil fuels in relation to GDP.","[Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir; Frodyma, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Papiez, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl; frodymak@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018; Frodyma, Katarzyna/I-4596-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Frodyma, Katarzyna/0000-0003-3201-4805","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) [2015/17/B/HS4/02685]","National Science Centre (NCN, Poland)","This paper is supported by funds from the National Science Centre (NCN, Poland) through grant No 2015/17/B/HS4/02685.",,11,3,3,0,4,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,270,279,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000028,0

Why? This paper brings together and further develops the concepts of cross-border externalities derived from the hierarchical network structure of the international financial system and domestic regulatory capacity. The US and the UK had the incentives (externalities) to promote and the domestic capacity to shape international standards. By contrast, the EU was mainly exposed to regional (intra-EU) cross-border externalities and lacked regulatory capacity on the matter. Paradoxically, international standards contributed to developing EU resolution capacity by facilitating an agreement on EU (and later on, euro area) rules.","[Quaglia, Lucia] Univ York, Dept Polit, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Quaglia, L (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Polit, York, N Yorkshire, England.",lucia.quaglia@york.ac.uk,,,Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) - BIGSSS (University of Bremen) - Visiting Fellowship,Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) - BIGSSS (University of Bremen) - Visiting Fellowship,This work was supported by Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) - BIGSSS (University of Bremen) - Visiting Fellowship.,,78,6,6,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This paper analyses the varying impact of these initiatives on the diverse types of Wealth Chains running through two stereotypical havens, Liechtenstein and the Seychelles, and one G20/OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) member rarely associated with illicit financial flows, Australia. Recent campaigns have had a significant impact on illicit Global Wealth Chains connected to micro-state tax havens, while leaving those to Australia unaffected. Even with reference to the micro-state havens, however, outside regulatory shifts have in some cases changed the flow or form of Wealth Chains by unintentionally creating new opportunities for offshore finance. Evidence is drawn from interviews and fieldwork in all three countries, secretly recorded footage of intermediaries explaining the workings of illicit Wealth Chains, and corporate and property records collected by a private investigator engaged by the author.","[Sharman, J.

In EU SMEs make up more than 99% of all companies and provide around 75 million jobs. They are a key source of job creation and stimulation of entrepreneurial spirit and innovation and are therefore essential for fostering competitiveness and maintaining employment in the EU. Yet SMEs often have problems in raising funds to finance fixed investments and inventory and working capital. SMEs mostly use internal sources while the most important external sources of SMEs are bank loans, which are not easily accessible. Hence, one of the priorities of the European Commission is stimulating SMEs through EU funds and programs in order to enable SMEs development and finally to contribute to economic growth. SMEs sector also dominates the economic structure of Croatian economy and they have similar financing problems. However, Croatia in period 2014 - 2020 have at disposal a total amount of 10.676 billion of euros from European structural and investment funds, of which 8.397 billion are aimed for cohesion policy objectives and 470 million euros are aimed for the development and competitiveness of SMEs. Besides, EU programs COSME and HORIZON 2020 are intended to provide direct support to SMEs and to create a favorable environment for their development. However, even though the number of successful project applications for small and medium-sized enterprises in the total share of Croatian project applications is relatively high, fund absorption has not reached satisfactory levels. Using the sample of Split-Dalmatia County's SMEs, this study finds out reasons for low absorption capacity from SMEs point of view: SMEs are interested in funds from European Union, but are not sufficiently familiar with their availability i.e. funds at their disposal, especially programs COSME and HORIZON 2020; SMEs state that they know how to apply for EU funds but considered the procedure as complicated and demanding regarding documentation, and that the needed knowledge and know-how for proposal is beyond their scope; SMEs are not satisfied with the cooperation with state institutions, especially Ministry of Regional Development and EU funds and Croatian Chamber of Economy. We point out four main conclusions: (1) SMEs are not enough aware of EU financing possibilities; (2) additional promotion of EU programs directly to SMEs is required; (3) additional education of SMEs regarding project proposal and documentation is needed and (4) more proactive policy of state institutions and cooperation with local authorities is expected. Finally, greater awareness and professional help might be a key in strengthening the SMEs, whose entrepreneurial spirit and innovation process is a prerequisite for economic growth and development.","[Viskovic, Josip; Udovicic, Martina] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Viskovic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",jviskovi@efst.hr,"Visković, Josip/D-5966-2017",,,,,,24,0,0,0,6,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,319,332,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.666,0.0,,,14,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200024,0

In accordance with the relevance between project performance evaluation and cash movement, the concept of Cash Value Added (CVA) is proposed with its theoretical foundation, calculation method and driving factors. A new post evaluation model based on CVA which combines discounted cash model with actual operating cash flow is designed. The financial situation of the project is analyzed from the perspectives of measuring current earning ability, assessing surplus value, revising internal return rate, and finding driving factors, the new model is an effective evaluation tool in line with the actual situation.","[Wang Shengyu; Li Tao] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Wang, SY (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-402-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,106.0,,,,,,494,497,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI9GR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416081200111,0

Next, we consider situations where different agents have different admissible sets of single-peaked preferences. We show by means of an example that unanimous and strategy-proof SCFs need not be tops-only in this situation, and consequently provide a sufficient condition on the admissible sets of preferences of the agents so that unanimity and strategy-proofness guarantee tops-onlyness. Finally, we characterize all domains on which (i) every unanimous and strategy-proof SCF is a min-max rule, and (ii) every min-max rule is strategy-proof.

It discusses why the reception of IGO signals may be problematic within the mass public: many individuals lack the attention and knowledge to process them. And among those who are attentive and knowledgeable, pre-existing negative attitudes about IGOs may lead them to process the signal differently than intended. Using an experimental research design, it presents evidence consistent with an IGO signaling effect from two different scenarios. In an economic scenario, a negative signal from the World Trade Organization reduces support for the government's economic policy. In a security scenario, a positive signal from the United Nations Security Council increases support for the government's military policy. However, both IGO signals are conditional on certain individual-level attributes, and the IGO signal in the security scenario is generally stronger than in the economic scenario.","[Bearce, David H.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cook, Thomas R.] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, MO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Bearce, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",david.bearce@colorado.edu,,"Cook, Thomas/0000-0001-8048-5949; BEARCE, DAVID/0000-0001-6239-4066",Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder,Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado at Boulder,"The views expressed in this paper are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City or the views of the Federal Reserve System.

This study examines the Indian wholesale price index inflation from 1951 to 2012 using P-star (or P*) models after accounting for the nonlinearities in the data by establishing the presence of a nonlinear long-run equilibrium. The paper establishes the presence of a threshold vector error correction model (TVECM) between prices and their long-run equilibrium with three optimal regimes to explain the short-run and long-run dynamics based on an error correcting transition term. Based on these results, the study classifies the various regimes that Indian inflation goes through based on historical economic events. The P* models (price gap, output gap and velocity gap models) were implemented regime-wise. The price gap models (output gap and income velocity gap determine inflation) were found to be optimal in the first and second regimes and consistent with theory. The velocity gap model (which has monetarist foundations) was found to be optimal in the third regime.","[Chaubal, Aditi] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, IITB, 1st Floor,HSS Dept Bldg, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Chaubal, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, IITB, 1st Floor,HSS Dept Bldg, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",aditichaubal@gmail.com,"Chaubal, Aditi/W-9665-2019","Chaubal, Aditi/0000-0002-7229-826X",,,,,34,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Their financing conditions were greatly eased by lower policy rates and a huge expansion in central bank balance sheets in major advanced economies. This has allowed these companies to increase their gearing, notably by greater foreign currency borrowing, thereby greatly increased the risk of currency mismatches. Microeconomic data show that it was not only companies providing tradable goods and services but also those producing non-tradable goods which have increased their foreign currency borrowing. The across-the-board decline in EME companies' profitability from mid-2010 to mid-2015 brought to light significant vulnerabilities and appeared to have constrained business fixed investment, and therefore growth, in the near term.

While concerns about the sustainability of China's growth model are rising, we assess to what extent rebalancing through a hard landing in China would impact other countries. After reviewing the main arguments pointing to a hard landing scenario-historical rebalancing precedents, overinvestment, unsustainable debt trends and real estate bubble-we use a global VAR methodology adapted to conditional forecasting to simulate the impact of a Chinese hard landing. We model metal and oil markets separately to account for their different end-use patterns and consumption intensity in China. According to our estimates, emerging economies would be hardest hit-with a 7.5% cumulated growth loss after 5 years-in particular in Emerging Asia and in commodity-exporting regions such as Latin America. The growth gap between emerging and advanced economies would be considerably reduced, leading to partial recoupling. In the light of these results, both the commodity supercycle and sustained convergence observed in emerging economies over the past decade could be to a large extent attributed to the high and unbalanced growth pattern in China.","[Gauvin, Ludovic] Banque France, Paris, France; [Rebillard, Cyril C.] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",European Central Bank; Bank of France; International Monetary Fund,"Gauvin, L (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,"Gauvin, Ludovic/0000-0002-6327-9737; Rebillard, Cyril/0000-0001-8972-2701",,,,,73,12,13,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2018,41.0,12,,,SI,,3379,3415,,10.1111/twec.12631,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HE7HH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000453601800007,0

This paper adds to the debate about the accuracy of travel demand prediction by addressing the technical problem of spatial autocorrelation. This paper aims to systematically assess the predictive performance of spatially explicit models that take spatial autocorrelation into account vis-a-vis more conventional models. We compare the performance of both types of models in predicting the transit passenger flows for alternative transit network designs in the region of Arnhem-Nijmegen, the Netherlands. We find that models taking spatial dependence into account outperform the conventional models in nearly all respects: model fit, parameters of variables, and the quality and stability of the predictions. Results show that taking spatial autocorrelation into account is not only important for the analysis of spatial interactions, but also result in different and more accurate predictions of the impact of interventions. We conclude that travel demand models should account for spatial dependence in order to avoid overprediction of the impact of transport system changes. We end with a discussion about the relevance of our findings for the debate about the causes for the observed systematic overestimation of travel demand in the practice of transport planning.","[Kerkman, Kasper] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Martens, Karel] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel; [Martens, Karel; Meurs, Henk] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Meurs, Henk] MuConsult, Amersfoort, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Kerkman, K (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",k.kerkman@fm.ru.nl,"Martens, Karel/G-5988-2011","Martens, Karel/0000-0002-5690-0556",BRENG Kenniscentrum,BRENG Kenniscentrum,"This research was supported by the BRENG Kenniscentrum (www.brengkenniscentrum.nl).We would like to thank Hermes/Connexxion (the local bus operator) for providing the anonymous transit passenger flow data that made this research possible.

While all these factors have potential implications for individuals' earnings, less is known about the connection between labour market change, patterns of sectoral growth and decline, and household poverty outcomes. This article shows distinct patterns of poverty outcomes by sector of employment, after controlling for other factors. However, household characteristics, in particular the presence of a second earner, do strongly mitigate the poverty risk.

The article aims to highlight in particular the cultural bias in destination choice by foreign tourists and its importance as a barrier for eradicating economic inequality between countries. We consider international tourism here as a mixed type of tradable service that leads to - short-time, but potentially massive - cross-border movements of people that can impact income redistribution among countries. Our claim is that this short-time movement is positively biased towards culturally closer localities. The recognition of this role of cultural proximity in the tourist choice destination can help fine-tune empirical models of international goods or services to reality. To test our hypothesis, a unique big data set for the EU28 and all the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (4031 observations on the shares of outbound tourists per country) is composed for the year 2014. We use data from the UN World Tourism Organization, Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales (CEPII, Paris; especially on linguistic proximity), and the six well-known Hofstede indices of cultural dimension: individualism, power-distance relationship, masculinity, uncertainty, indulgence and long-term orientation. To fully specify our tourist destination model, we include also climate-related explanatory variables, reflecting sun, rain and wind differences between sending and recipient countries. Regression analysis with fixed effects and a hierarchical (multilevel) model both lead to consistent empirical estimates. Our results clearly demonstrate that tourism is a significant counter-balancing factor for the B-S effect that seems to be present and related to non-trade sectors and wages across the countries involved. Moreover, we find that linguistic proximity is statistically and economically the most powerful quantitative proxy for cultural factors, which determine the outbound tourists' destination choice.","[Tubadji, Annie] Univ West England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Poznan, Poland; [Nijkamp, Peter] JADSs Hertogenbosch, Shertogenbosch, Netherlands",University of West England; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Tubadji, A (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",atubadji@hotmail.com,"Tubadji, Annie/IUP-4828-2023","kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132",,,,,95,14,15,1,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Using household data from the American Housing Survey and Public Use Micro-data Sample, we find that first-generation Asian and Hispanic/Latino immigrants are more likely to live in coresidence households; and this is influenced by immigrant gender, age, education, income, employment and density. Education and income are inversely related to coresiding, while higher immigrant density increases the propensity to coreside. Contextual effects reveal that neighborhoods with a relatively large Caucasian average household size increase coresidence behavior among immigrants; and the income of Caucasians living in the area is inversely related to immigrant coresiding behavior. Second-generation Asian immigrants are more likely to live independently, while second-generation Hispanic/Latino immigrants have a higher propensity to coreside; however, they are influenced contextually by geographic household and income patterns. We further specify findings by considering local housing price, the fusion of immigrants in the United States, agglomeration of immigrants in central city and a comparison between immigrants in United States and similarly aged natives in China. Our results are robust to potential sample-selection bias and social interaction boundary selection bias.","[Wu, Yi] Jinan Univ, 601 Western Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sah, Vivek] Univ San Diego, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Tidwell, Alan] Columbus State Univ, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA",Jinan University; University of San Diego; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, 601 Western Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",angeliawuyi@gmail.com; viveksah@sandiego.edu; atidwell@columbusstate.edu,,"WU, YI/0000-0003-0354-5658",,,,,90,8,10,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2018,46.0,4,,,,,783,835,,10.1111/1540-6229.12178,0.0,,,53,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,HA1BQ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449946800002,0

This article explores how the EU behaves as a global power, and how the illiberal turn may diminish it. We present Moravcsik's four core claims about the EU as the second superpower using the lens of Liberal Intergovernmentalism. We argue that the EU is more a potential than an actual superpower because its considerable hard and soft resources are not always converted into global influence. We focus on two challenges to this power conversion, which we illustrate in the areas of trade and enlargement: first, the uneven transfer of competences to the EU level and, second, the presence of illiberal regimes in the EU, which makes it more difficult to agree on common policies and tools anchored in democratic values.","[Meunier, Sophie] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Vachudova, Milada Anna] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",Princeton University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Meunier, S (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Robertson 437, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",smeunier@princeton.edu,,"Meunier, Sophie/0000-0003-1866-7308; Vachudova, Milada Anna/0000-0001-8587-5081","European Union [649281]; Jean Monnet Chair of European Integration; Center for European Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649281] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme","European Union(European Union (EU)); Jean Monnet Chair of European Integration; Center for European Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme)","We wish to thank the participants to the Ninth Annual Princeton Workshop on European Integration on 8 May 2017; the participants at the workshop 'Liberal Intergovernmentalism and Its Critics' at the European University Institute in Florence on 15-16 March 2018; our discussants Robert Keohane, Maria Snegovaya, Richard Maher and Federicha Bicchi for comments on an earlier version of this article.

We use a database of body mass index (BMI) estimates across countries over four decades published by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. We find that BMIs converge among European countries but not in the rest of the world. Consistent with the theoretical model, our long-run estimates suggest that European nations will show an average BMI above healthy levels. In particular, females and males will show average BMIs classified as overweight levels (BMI = 28.3). Confidence intervals and sensitivity analysis suggest that males might reach long-term BMI levels associated with obesity (BMI > 30).

However, this highlights an interesting puzzle: subnational authorities in unitary and centralized polities usually lack the formal competence and have limited resources to engage beyond their territorial limits. Why, then, do they engage at the European level? This article addresses this question by exploring their motivations for participation in European transnational networking. These motivations are assessed against a Europeanization framework, exploring whether subnational authorities adopt the logic of consequentialism' or the logic of appropriateness' when engaging in transnational networking. The article argues that subnational authorities are rational actors, maximizing the opportunities presented by the EU without subscribing to its normative aims. In a context marked by financial pressures and Brexit, these findings provide a useful foundation for analyzing the on-going EU-local relationship, and for explaining changes to subnational authorities' approaches to European engagement.","[Huggins, Christopher] Univ West Scotland, Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland",University of West Scotland,"Huggins, C (通讯作者)，Univ West Scotland, Sch Media Culture & Soc, Paisley Campus, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland.",christopher.huggins@uws.ac.uk,,"Huggins, Christopher/0000-0002-0108-7887",,,,,70,12,14,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Using NLSY data supplemented with Geocode data, we estimate the effect of benefit replacement rates on changes in individual alcohol consumption following job loss. Identification relies on variation in replacement rates across states and over time. Results indicate that a 100% increase in benefit replacement rate, roughly equivalent to a state moving from the lowest to the highest replacement rate, would, on average, result in unemployed individuals consuming 19.1 additional drinks a month. Looking at the change in an individual's binge drinking upon job loss, individuals receiving the highest level of benefits are 14.7% more likely to increase their binge drinking than those receiving the least generous benefits. We find that individuals' responsiveness to changes in replacement rates vary based on drinking history, industry labor market conditions, education, and age. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We then conduct counterfactual analyses to investigate the short and long-run roles of factor allocation in the income distribution across provinces. The results show that SP, FME and FE can explain 23%, 8.5% and 68.5% of economic growth, while labour, capital and energy reallocation account for aggregate productivity growth of about 47%, -4.8% and -0.1%. Furthermore, when the factors are efficiently allocated, transferring labour (capital, energy) from agriculture (service, industry) to the other sectors will increase the income per capita by 29.5% and 42.5% in the short and long term. Meanwhile, efficient factor allocation accounts for 32% and 29.7% of aggregate productivity and reduces the income variation across provinces by 25.5% and 23% in the short and long run, respectively.","[Liu, Guanchun; Liu, Yuanyuan] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guanchun; Liu, Yuanyuan] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Liu, GC (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Liu, GC (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,"liu, yuanyuan/HSG-8372-2023; liu, 园园/HJI-4438-2023; liu, yuanyuan/GWZ-5838-2022; liu, yuanyuan/IQS-2755-2023",,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17XNLG01]; Ministry of Education of China [16JJD790057],"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",The research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 17XNLG01).

This study examines the impacts of MLS-member information sharing intensity on housing market outcomes, with information sharing intensity measured as the average daily number of times MLS members view an individual house's listing during its marketing period. We develop a theoretical model and derive the equilibrium. The model predicts that increased information sharing intensity leads to greater probability of sale, reduced time on market, and higher house prices. Analysis of data from 32,102 listing records validates the model's propositions.

The need to evaluate these tradeoffs is, in part, driven by the emergence of environmental impact mitigation, i.e., emissions reductions, as a critical concern of transit operators and governments around the world. To address these concerns, we present an optimization model to support the design of transit bus fleets while accounting for costs, level-of-service requirements, and environmental impact. Methodologically, the work bridges applications of Economic Input-Output analysis to conduct environmental lifecycle assessment, with seminal work in production economics. We apply the framework to support design of bus fleets consisting of 4 bus types differing in their fuel-propulsion technology: ultra-low sulfur diesel, hybrid diesel-electric, compressed natural gas, and hydrogen fuel-cell. The 4 bus types were assessed in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory transit bus evaluation and demonstration studies conducted over the period 2003-2009. The nominal problem herein is to minimize acquisition, operation and disposal costs. Constraints in the model are used to impose a minimum frequency of service, i.e., headway, and to ensure that route capacity satisfies passenger demand. Environmental impact is considered along the following dimensions: energy consumption, and emissions of greenhouse gasses, particulate matter, and nitrous oxides. Results show that fleet heterogeneity increases in scenarios where demand fluctuates, i.e., peak vs. off-peak. Perhaps even more interesting, we show how the dual/shadow prices provide a (monetary) measure of the tradeoffs among level of service and environmental impact, and discuss how they can be used to obtain robust fleet configurations.","[Durango-Cohen, Pablo L.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd,A332, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [McKenzie, Elaine C.] Cambridge Systemat, 115 S La Salle, Chicago, IL 60603 USA",Northwestern University,"Durango-Cohen, PL (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd,A332, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",pdc@northwestern.edu,"Durango-Cohen, Pablo L/B-6939-2009",,,,,,27,4,4,4,51,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The EBLUP assumes normal and independent random small area effects as well as normal and independent random sampling errors. Under these assumptions, the variable of interest also follows a normal distribution. In practice, however, the above assumptions are often violated. The variable of interest is often non-normal and highly skewed, and the small areas are frequently spatially dependent. In this paper, we propose the spatial empirical Bayes predictor (SEBP) of the small area mean of a positively skewed variable of interest in the presence of spatial dependence among the random small area effects. We assume that the variable of interest follows a normal distribution after a log transformation and that its log transform is linked to some auxiliary variables by a nested error regression model. The SEBP is derived under the log-transformed nested error regression model. By way of simulation, we show that compared to its alternatives, i.e., the direct estimator which is solely based on the survey data for the small area under study, the EBLUP which does not take into account spatial dependence and skewness, the empirical Bayes predictor which takes into account skewness but not spatial dependence among the small areas, the SEBP has the smallest average relative bias and average relative root-mean-squared error for various combinations-though not all-of skewness and spatial correlation.","[Handayani, Dian] State Univ Jakarta, Dept Stat, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Handayani, Dian; Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Groningen, Netherlands; [Handayani, Dian; Kurnia, Anang; Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Stat, Bogor, Indonesia; [Folmer, Henk] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Universitas Negeri Jakarta; University of Groningen; Bogor Agricultural University; Northwest A&F University - China,"Notodiputro, KA (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Stat, Bogor, Indonesia.",dianh@unj.ac.id; h.folmer@rug.nl; anangk@apps.ipb.ac.id; khairil@apps.ipb.ac.id,"Handayani, Dian/GPC-7317-2022; Kurnia, Anang/CAE-9008-2022; Kurnia, Anang/AAG-9094-2020; Launggu, Kani/JJC-0851-2023; Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar/CAG-2604-2022","Kurnia, Anang/0000-0001-9409-2361; Kurnia, Anang/0000-0001-9409-2361; Launggu, Kani/0009-0000-7774-951X; Handayani, Dian/0000-0002-2721-1946",,,,,18,2,2,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

With the rapid growth in volatility-based financial innovations and market, it is beneficial and essential to look beyond the traditional restrictive assumptions. This paper discusses Bayesian analysis of the variance changepoints problem in linear models with flexible error distributions. Specifically, we consider the class of scale mixtures of normal distributions, which not only exhibits symmetric heavy-tailed behavior, but also includes many common error distributions as special cases, such as the normal and Student-t distributions. Our proposed approach can reduce the influence of atypical observations and thus offer a robust technique for detecting the variance changepoints in many financial and economic data. We propose an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure to generate posterior samples and in turn to perform Bayesian inference.

If this is not done, the structure can be revised later, although by then the opposition will be greater. The appropriate form and focus of airport regulation will and should evolve over time, as experience accumulates and as economic and technical opportunities themselves evolve. As competition develops, the extent of airport regulation can with advantage be reduced over time, with a correspondingly increased role for airlines and their customers.","[Littlechild, Stephen] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Littlechild, Stephen] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England",University of Birmingham; University of Cambridge,"Littlechild, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.;Littlechild, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England.",sclittlechild@tanworth.mercianet.co.uk,,,,,,,115,10,11,1,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In models with a homogeneous sector, local market size is generally more strongly correlated with a country's industry share, whereas accessibility better explains a country's wage. We analytically show that result in a simplified case and then confirm it using simulations with random trading networks. In models with only differentiated sectors, both local market size and accessibility are highly correlated with wages. The impact of local market size on industry location is more robust than the impact of local market size on wages in economic geography models.","[Barbero, Javier] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Growth & Innovat B, Terr Dev Unit, Seville, Spain; [Behrens, Kristian] Univ Quebec Montreal, ESG UQAM, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Behrens, Kristian] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Behrens, Kristian] CEPR, London, England; [Zofio, Jose L.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Barbero, J (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Growth & Innovat B, Terr Dev Unit, Seville, Spain.",Javier.BARBERO-JIMENEZ@ec.europa.eu; behrens.kristian@uqam.ca; jose.zofio@uam.es,"Zofío, José Luis/K-5178-2014; Zofío, José L./HTQ-2877-2023; Barbero, Javier/K-5741-2014","Zofío, José Luis/0000-0003-1170-9501; Barbero, Javier/0000-0002-2155-3996","Spanish Ministry of Education [AP2010-1401]; CRC Program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-21643, ECO2013-46980-P, ECO2016-79650-P]; Russian Academic Excellence Project [5-100]","Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); CRC Program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Russian Academic Excellence Project(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian FederationProject 5-100, Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","We thank the editor, Laurent Gobillon, and two anonymous referees for very useful comments.

To address this question, we use the Exporter Dynamics Dataset, which contains new data on the microstructure of exports for 34 developing countries between 1997 and 2011, and investigate how exporter behaviour is affected by financial crises. We find that financial crises in both the origin and destination countries have a large negative effect on firm, product and destination dynamics, particularly in industries dependent on external finance. Financial crises make the costs of exporting more difficult to meet and in turn reduce firms' ability to start exporting, introduce new products and sell to new destinations. We also find that the impact of financial crises is less pronounced in exporting countries with relatively more open capital accounts, suggesting that portfolio inflows may be a good substitute for underdeveloped domestic financial markets.","[Jaud, Melise; Kiendrebeogo, Youssouf] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Jaud, Melise] Lausanne Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",The World Bank; University of Lausanne; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jaud, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Jaud, M (通讯作者)，Lausanne Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange/0000-0001-8920-4699; Kiendrebeogo, Youssouf/0000-0002-3051-8930",Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir ANR-10-LABX-14-01.,,49,3,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1640,1663,,10.1111/twec.12596,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434646400007,0

We develop a measure of local credit supply that is based on the market shares of the banks that serve a local economy and the national change in each bank's lending that is attributable to supply factors (i.e., purged of local demand factors). The decrease in our credit supply indicator, which is strongly correlated to the outstanding loan dynamics, explains the 13% of the contraction in real value added with respect to the pre-crisis period. The negative effects on the value added are heterogeneous across sectors and, in particular, are larger for the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the impact of the credit crunch is concentrated on the small firms, in the areas that are more dependent upon external finance and in the Central-Northern provinces. Finally, credit supply shocks affected lending but not real outcomes in the pre-crisis period.","[Barone, Guglielmo] Bank Italy, Florence, Italy; [de Blasio, Guido; Mocetti, Sauro] Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy; [Barone, Guglielmo] RCEA, Rimini, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Mocetti, S (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Directorate Gen Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy.",sauro.mocetti@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,19,15,16,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

We describe the implementation of this procedure in the US-REGEN model and compare impacts on energy system decisions with more common approaches. The results demonstrate how power sector modeling and capacity planning decisions are sensitive to the representation of intra-annual variation and how our proposed approach outperforms simple heuristic selection procedures with lower resolution. The representative hour approach preserves key properties of the joint underlying hourly distributions, whereas seasonal average approaches over-value wind and solar at higher penetration levels and under-value investment in dispatchable capacity by inaccurately capturing the corresponding residual load duration curves.","[Blanford, Geoffrey J.; Bistline, John E.

Employing a novel district-level panel data set, we find that mass mobilization produces a dramatic decrease in cultivated area. Surprisingly, farms with communal land tenure exhibit greater resilience to the labor shock than private farms. The resilience stems from peasants reallocating labor in favor of the commune because of the increased attractiveness of its nonmarket access to land and social insurance.

The effect of grandparents on grandchildren's weight outcome is under-analyzed. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we examine the effect of grandparents' coresidence on childhood weight outcome with a sample of 2-13-year-old children in China. We use instrumental variables to address the potential endogeneity of grandparents' coresidence. We show that the effect of grandparents' coresidence on childhood weight outcome is significantly positive. Grandparents' coresidence affects a grandchild's weight outcome through changes in dietary patterns and physical activity. The effects on dietary patterns exist in urban areas and significantly lower in rural areas. Grandparents' coresidence decreases physical activity more in rural areas than in urban areas. Furthermore, the effects of coresidence on protein intake and physical activities of children above 6 are significantly higher for males than females. A robustness check, including an ordered logit model with a body mass index category and estimation with additional data, validates our findings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study combines the widely-applied attitudinal factors with three low-carbon-related factors: low-carbon awareness, low-carbon knowledge and low carbon habits, and then investigates the relationship between these factors and the behavior guiding the choice of commuting mode. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted in Beijing, Hangzhou and Jinan. The results of the survey show that low-carbon knowledge and low-carbon habits have direct influence on commuting mode choice, and low-carbon knowledge and instrumental factor are two strongest predictors affecting the choice of commuting mode. Further, great gap exists between behavior intention and actual choice. The results also demonstrate that there are significant differences among the three cities.

We find that people on average learn to be overconfident faster than they learn their true ability and we present an intuitive-Bayesian model of confidence which integrates confidence biases and learning. Uncertainty about one's true ability to perform a task in isolation can be responsible for large and stable confidence biases, namely limited discrimination, the hard-easy effect, the Dunning-Kruger effect, conservative learning from experience and the overprecision phenomenon (without underprecision) if subjects act as Bayesian learners who rely only on sequentially perceived performance cues and contrarian illusory signals induced by doubt. Moreover, these biases are likely to persist since the Bayesian aggregation of past information consolidates the accumulation of errors and the perception of contrarian illusory signals generates conservatism and under-reaction to events. Taken together, these two features may explain why intuitive Bayesians make systematically wrong predictions of their own performance.","[Levy-Garboua, Louis; Gazel, Marco] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Levy-Garboua, Louis; Askari, Muniza; Gazel, Marco] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Lévy-Garboua, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.;Lévy-Garboua, L (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",louis.levy-garboua@univ-paris1.fr; muneeza_askari@hotmail.com; marco-antonio.gazel@univ-paris1.fr,,,"French Ministere de la Recherche (ACI Contextes sociaux, contextes institutionnels et rendements des systemes educatifs)","French Ministere de la Recherche (ACI Contextes sociaux, contextes institutionnels et rendements des systemes educatifs)","We thank the French Ministere de la Recherche (ACI Contextes sociaux, contextes institutionnels et rendements des systemes educatifs) for generous support, Claude Montmarquette for offering an opportunity to conduct part of the experimental sessions at CIRANO (Montreal), and Noemi Berlin for numerous discussions.

We find REITs with higher liquidity risk are more likely to manipulate earnings prior to equity offerings and uninformed trading is higher following real earnings management.

Moreover, variation in the density of universities is explained partly by variation in the density of earlier educational institutions, and the variation in the density of these earlier institutions is associated with medieval exposure to religious and ethnic diversity. Support for EU membership is known to be correlated with liberalism, and this paper shows that patterns of voting in the 2016 referendum are also associated with the density of universities and earlier educational institutions, and with medieval exposure to religious and ethnic diversity.","[Fielding, David] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Fielding, D (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.",,,"Fielding, David/0000-0003-0506-4233",,,,,36,5,5,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41.0,4,,,SI,,1131,1146,,10.1111/twec.12621,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430113300010,0

In theory, the capitalization of subsidies into grassland rents has become increasingly important as a result of the decoupling of direct payments from production in 2005. The focus is on the pass-through of both coupled and decoupled direct payments on grassland rentals in Western Germany. The empirical investigation is based upon farm-level data of grassland rental rates from the six farm census surveys carried out between 2001 and 2013. The results of spatial econometric models show that landlords of grassland have benefited strongly from the decoupling of direct payments. For the period prior to the decoupling of direct payments, the estimates point to low capitalisation of the livestock payments into grassland rentals. For the period after decoupling, the estimations reveal a significant pass-through of direct payments to landowners, with the marginal capitalisation increasing over time. At the end of the observation period, after regional standardisation of the payments, the estimates show marginal capitalisation rates of 87-94 cents per additional premium euro, suggesting almost complete capitalisation of the funding into the rental price for grassland.","[Hennig, Solveigh; Breustedt, Gunnar] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Agr Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Breustedt, G (通讯作者)，Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Agr Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",gbreustedt@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,53,9,9,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In practice, it can be simply dispensed as a discount of the access charge the railway undertaldngs should pay to the rail network infrastructure manager. It also differs by type of train, to account for their different infrastructural needs, and can be adjusted on a yearly basis to account for ongoing network improvements. The main methodological challenge lies in the quantification of the infra structural gap, defined as the difference of the unit transport costs in the current and in the optimal scenario, as a consequence of the non-additivity of concerned costs. For this aim, a specific procedure is illustrated and applied to the railway intermodal transport in Italy, to show the feasibility of the approach and highlight the differences with respect to the current incentive schemes.","[Marzano, Vittorio; Tocchi, Daniela; Papola, Andrea; Cascetta, Ennio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Naples, Italy; [Simonelli, Fulvio] Univ Sannio, Dept Engn, Benevento, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Sannio,"Marzano, V (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Naples, Italy.",vmarzano@unina.it,"Papola, Andrea/HTQ-2942-2023","TOCCHI, Daniela/0000-0001-5918-6258; SIMONELLI, Fulvio/0000-0002-8636-1194; PAPOLA, Andrea/0000-0002-7357-6401",University of Naples; Compagnia di San Paolo,University of Naples; Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo),"The authors would like to thank Rete Ferroviaria Italian (RFI) and the Struttura Tecnica di Mission of the Italian Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport for providing rail freight data, and the master students at the University of Naples Francesco Capobianco and Dania Pone for their help in running the example in Section 4.

We code the contents of the respondents' self-reported reasons for driving (i.e. the instrumental rationalities attributed to driving with respect to varying purposes) to identify keywords representing motivation to drive; we then analyse the keyword data using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Study 2 examines how the dimensions discovered through study 1 relate to propensity to carpool, using structural equation modelling (SEM). Data for Study 2 are the survey responses of commuters (N = 1028) based in the United States. The MDS reveals four key dimensions of motivation to drive. These capture instrumental rationalities for driving within four situational domains which we term: (1) Family; (2) Public transport impractical changes; (3) Rigid schedule; and (4) Non-urban areas. The SEM results show that the regression coefficients on propensity to carpool of Public transport impractical changes and Rigid schedule are significant and negative; the Family domain has a positive but non-significant regression coefficient. Regarding demographics, men's mean values on all four domain variables are significantly higher than those for women, except for the Family domain where the mean value for women is higher; meanwhile, age predicts decreasing propensity to carpool. Additionally, the situational domains of Public transport impractical changes, Rigid schedule and Non-urban areas significantly positively correlate. Consequently, overall, the results imply that addressing commuters' instrumental rationalities for driving, namely increasing schedule flexibility and providing more direct or quicker public transport, could indirectly encourage commuters to carpool. The study makes an original contribution by estimating the causal relationship between commuters' motivation to drive and propensity to carpool.","[Neoh, Jun Guan] PwC, Southampton, Hants, England; [Chipulu, Maxwell; Marshall, Alasdair; Tewkesbury, Adam] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Chipulu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Room 4044,Bldg 2,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",junguan.neoh@gmail.com; m.chipulu@soton.ac.uk; A.Marshall@soton.ac.uk; A.J.Tewkesbury@soton.ac.uk,"Chipulu, Maxwell/C-2308-2013","Chipulu, Maxwell/0000-0002-0139-6188; Marshall, Alasdair/0000-0002-9789-8042",,,,,124,29,32,4,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Existing methods for spatial discrete choice models become infeasible in micro-level data applications due to large sample sizes. We propose an extension of Klier and McMillen's (2008) generalized moments estimator to multinomial choice models with spatial lag dependence that is computationally simple. Simulations indicate that the proposed estimator captures accurately the degree of spatial dependence in the data, provided spatial dependence is not too high. The methodology is employed to analyze the conversion process to various land uses using parcel-level data from a rural-urban fringe county within a large metropolitan area. We find evidence of positive spatial dependence of about 0.36 a result consistent with the widely-accepted idea that land-use conversion is a spatial process. This suggests that uncoordinated local land-use policies designed at a small scale, while attempting to manage growth at a local level, may fragment urban development and result in suboptimal land-use patterns at a regional level.","[Carrion-Flores, Carmen E.; Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] GLO, Geneva, Switzerland; [Guci, Ledia] Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC USA",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Flores-Lagunes, A (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",cecarrio@maxwell.syr.edu; afloresl@maxwell.syr.edu; ledia.guci@bea.gov,,,,,,,80,4,5,1,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

While there are some promising theoretical and empirical findings pointing to positive contributions of Islamic finance, there is still a need for Islamic finance to distinguish itself from the conventional finance and to further demonstrate its real effect.","[Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Sch Grad Studies, Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Alam, Nafis] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia; [Alam, Nafis] Sunway Univ Malaysia, Sunway Univ Business Sch, Bandar Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia",INCEIF; University of Nottingham Malaysia; Sunway University,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Sch Grad Studies, Int Ctr Educ Islamic Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020; Alam, Nafis/AAN-6699-2021; Alam, Nafis/D-5071-2014; Alam, Nafis/AAG-5557-2021","Alam, Nafis/0000-0002-7096-3692; Alam, Nafis/0000-0002-7096-3692",,,,,31,14,14,7,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,668,673,,10.1111/twec.12506,0.0,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300001,0

Since the late 1980s monetary policy has been delegated to independent central banks. By contrast, fiscal stabilization remained in political hands but has progressively been constrained by rules; the Stability and Growth Pact in the EU is a prominent case in point. While delegation and independence eliminated the inflation bias, fiscal policy still suffers from a deficit bias as enforcement of rules remains difficult. A logical extension of all attempts to progressively tie the hands of politics would be to carve out the stabilization function from the broader field of fiscal policy and to delegate it to national independent fiscal councils. Apart from addressing the political economy behind the deficit bias, such a step would facilitate a better co-ordination of macroeconomic policies in Economic and Monetary Union.","[Larch, Martin] European Commiss, Rue Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Braendle, Thomas] Univ Basel, Swiss Fed Dept Finance, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Larch, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Rue Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",martin.larch@ec.europa.eu,"Larch, Martin/AAI-7587-2021",,,,,,50,15,15,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The main contribution is the demonstration of the heterogeneous effects on host country competition of the two main channels of foreign market penetration that have been assigned fundamental differences by economic theory: imports and foreign direct investment. The results of dynamic estimates of firm-level markups reveal a pro-competitive effect of imports, while foreign direct investment shows no clear overall impact, suggesting a cancelling out of competitive pressure and spillovers. These findings matter for both future empirical research and policy considerations that must weigh the positive and negative effects of foreign market integration on the competitive environment and consumer welfare.","[Weche, John P.] Monopolies Commiss, Bonn, Germany; [Weche, John P.] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Weche, JP (通讯作者)，Monopolies Commiss, Bonn, Germany.;Weche, JP (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Luneburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,72,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2018,41.0,3,,,,,801,830,,10.1111/twec.12590,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FY7DH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427021300009,0

Changes are conditioned by the shifts in the economic structure and there is a tendency to create the highest economic development rates possible with the intensification of production providing a large quantum of new value and greater export possibilities. The most important goal of the development path must be functionally achievable with a clearly defined strategy of what to produce': how to produce': when to produce and 'for whom to produce so that each country could achieve higher efficiency and wider equality. The structural changes so far have not created new production sectors which would keep the pace with innovative technological changes. New directions of geoeconomic flows imply permanent changes in the development structure of small countries with constant technological innovation that requires the engagement of high quality personnel. There is a necessity of structural changes in the main production and export activities and it should be based on medium and high technology intensive products and services within the scientific-innovative directions of digitization. Bringing foreign direct investments must be intensified in the upcoming period, which will then contribute to the strengthening of the competitiveness of national economies and individual sectors of small countries and therefore providing a functional solution to the problems of regional differences and employment, The agglomeration effects of new growth poles should bring greater business cooperation between countries and regions.

In this paper we produce improved short-term forecasts of the demand for energy produced from five different sources in the UK averaging from a set of 6 univariate and multivariate models. The forecasts are averaged using six different weighting functions including Simple Model Averaging (SMA), Granger-Ramanathan Model Averaging (GRMA), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Smoothing Akaike (SAIC), Mallows Weights (MMA) and Jackknife (JMA). Our results show that model averaging gives always a lower Mean Square Forecast Error (MSFE) than the best/optimal models within each class however selected. For example, for Coal, Wind and Hydro generated Electricity forecasts generated with model averaging, we report a MSFE about 12% lower than that obtained using the best selected individual models. Among these, the best individual forecasting models are the Non-Linear Artificial Neural Networks and the Vector Autoregression and that models selected by the Jackknife have often superior performance. However, MMA averaged forecasts almost always beat the predictions obtained from any of the individual models however selected, and those generated by other model averaging techniques.","[Barassi, Marco] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Zhao, Yuqian] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Birmingham; University of Waterloo,"Barassi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.r.barassi@bham.ac.uk; yuqian.zhao@uwaterloo.ca,,"Barassi, Marco/0000-0001-8945-2457",,,,,49,6,6,3,30,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2018,39.0,,,,1,,209,239,,10.5547/01956574.39.SI1.mbar,0.0,,,31,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ4BL,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457118600013,0

Yet, governments are responding to this backlash differently. Some countries heavily targeted by investor claims have terminated BITs while others have sought only moderate reforms to key provisions. Despite the rich literature on BITs, we know little about the dissonance in government approaches toward investor rights: Why do some countries terminate BITs while others seek to reform them? This article explores the strategies governments used to defend public and political interests during investor-state disputes in Argentina and Ecuador. Governments in both cases adopted policies they knew were likely to infringe on investor rights and employed strategies to mitigate the costs of investor claims with some success. Variation in government approaches, namely Ecuador's decision to terminate BITs and Argentina's decision to maintain them, stems from ideological differences and state-society relations. Ideological differences, which reflect their social bases, caused policy-makers to weigh the costs and benefits of BITs relative to domestic interests differently. This demonstrates that governments are not passive recipients of international rules, but instead will knowingly break with such rules where domestic interests are perceived to necessitate it.","[Calvert, Julia] Univ Edinburgh, Int Polit Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Calvert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Int Polit Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,,71,15,15,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

China's phenomenal rise as a global power, its transformed relations with the West and diaspora communities, and its toughening control over political dissent inside and outside the country have created an increasingly arduous and complex mobilising terrain for the dissidents in exile. Meanwhile, Taiwan's democratisation, political nativisation, and China-focused economic exchanges have minimised Taipei's role as the mainland exiles' traditional backer. Finally, the shifting norms, demographics, and practices of the overseas Chinese diasporas have further compounded these challenges.","[Chen, Jie] Univ Western Australia, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",jie.chen@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,,26,6,7,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,1,,,,,108,129,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1418297,0.0,,,22,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FU3JI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423746700006,0

I argue that professionals in moral philosophy have a significant role to play in discussions of the meaning and moral relevance of animal welfare, and that my own account provides a superior alternative to address moral issues in the two key areas addressed in Haynes's work: the use of animals for biomedical science, and their use for human food.","[Deckers, J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med Educ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Deckers, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Med Educ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",jan.deckers@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,72,77,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_9,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000009,0

However, under the background of full circulation, China's listed companies' equity concentration anomalies have not been fundamentally relieved, while the largest shareholders have lost their holding position in the capital market. Thus, a new round of vision of transfer of the control right of the first largest shareholders emerged. On the basis of combing and analyzing the existing research literature system at home and abroad, the empirical findings of the transfer of control rights of first largest shareholder in the A stock market of China from 2012 to 2016 are found: after full circulation, the transfer control rights of first largest shareholder is still serious; the first largest shareholder of listed companies involved in the transfer of control rights is the computer, communications and other electronic equipment manufacturing industry, followed by the electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing industry; corporate investors, other corporate investors, and public shares (circulating A shares) investors account for the majority of the shares transferred by the first largest shareholder of the listed company; Judging from the nature of the company, private enterprises are more vulnerable to the transfer of control of the first largest shareholder.

The most common instrument is a feed-in tariff (FIT). This paper empirically tests whether or not FIT policies have been effective in encouraging the development of photovoltaic solar (PV), explicitly taking into account the structure and consistency of FITs. Panel data estimations are employed for 30 OECD member countries in the period 1990-2011. We find a positive effect of the presence of a FIT on the development of a country's added yearly capacity of PV per capita. This is in line with the results found in the existing literature. However, our study shows that the literature underestimates the potential impact of FITs, as the effect of a well-designed FIT is much larger than the average effect of the currently applied FITs. Not only the height of the tariff is important, but also the duration of the contract and the absence/presence of a cap have an impact. We also show that consistency greatly affects the effectiveness of FITs. Consistency is especially important when the tariff of a FIT is low. The total effect of a FIT can be seven times larger if it is well designed. Our results are robust for differences between countries with respect to the availability of other policy instruments, the use of nuclear or hydro power and the level of CO2 emissions.","[Dijkgraaf, Elbert] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Dijkgraaf, Elbert] Tinbergen Inst, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Dorp, Tom P.] Solarplaza Int BV, Conradstr 38 D3-135, NL-3013 AP Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Maasland, Emiel] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Dijkgraaf, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Dijkgraaf, E (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dijkgraaf@ese.eur.nl; emaasland@ese.eur.nl,,"Maasland, Emiel/0000-0002-6134-3395; Dijkgraaf, Elbert/0000-0003-3568-1558",,,,,39,38,40,0,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2018,39.0,1,,,,,81,99,,10.5547/01956574.39.1.edij,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS0PR,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419476700004,0

The majority of local self-governments struggle with the problem of balanced budget. Therefore, in order to implement many public tasks, including those concerning revitalization, pooling of funds is needed. Public-private partnership can constitute a significant instrument used in the aforementioned pooling of funds since it enables combining budget funds with private capital. The PPP is a form of implementing public tasks recommended by the European Commission. The experiences of EU countries show that the PPP model constitutes an attractive format for carrying out revitalization projects. This may be substantiated by the projects implemented in Western Europe (Germany, Great Britain) as well as in East-Central Europe (Hungary). In Poland, the market of PPP projects is in the initial phase of development and it is dominated by the investments implemented by territorial self-government units. The objective of this paper is to present the results of the revitalization project of degraded urban areas carried out in Poland with the application of the PPP model in the context of the solutions adopted in selected EU countries. The research method applied in the paper consists of a study of literature on the subject, a presentation of the legal regulations with regard to revitalization and the PPP as well as an empirical analysis of the revitalization project carried out in the City of Sopot with the application of the PPP model. The project implemented in Poland is of a pioneer and hybrid nature. The experience gained during the project enabled the preparation of a set of Good PPP practices in the area of revitalization in Poland, and is an inspiration for other cities, which translated into the implementation of another PPP project in revitalization.","[Hajdys, Dagmara; Slebocka, Magdalena] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Hajdys, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.",dagmara.hajdys@uni.lodz.pl; magdalena.slebocka@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,201,211,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300021,0

Based on a modified version of the obsolescing bargain model, the paper argues that governments opt to co-produce corporate social responsibility when they face pressures to reform the firm's relationship with society but are unable or unwilling to change the legal framework that governs it. In this regard, institutional stickiness can result in the displacement of bargaining from the formal rules and regulations that govern foreign direct investment, to the unregulated and informal practices associated with the social responsibilities of business. The argument is confirmed through a qualitative examination of state-firm relations in the mining sectors of Argentina and Peru.","[Haslam, Paul Alexander] Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Haslam, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",phaslam@uottawa.ca,,"Haslam, Paul/0000-0003-3336-425X",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada [410-2009-0950],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This study was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada [grant number 410-2009-0950].,,83,11,13,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The first factor consisted of five rice varieties i.e. IR-64, Mekongga, Inpari Sidenuk, Ciherang, and HIPA-18. The second factor was irrigation, consisting of two levels, i.e. SRI and conventional methods. The results of this research showed that the Harvest Index of IR-64 was higher than those of Ciherang and HIPA-18. Inpari Sidenuk variety had the lowest Harvest Index. The grain weight and unfilled grain weight of Ciherang, HIPA-18 and Mekongga were better than those of Inpari Sidenuk. SRI irrigation affected the fresh weight and root length of rice plants. SRI irrigation conditions produced heavier fresh weight and longer root than conventional irrigation. SRI irrigation conditions produced heavier fresh weight and longer root than conventional irrigation. Productive tillers of IR 64 variety with irrigation treatment using SRI was higher than Mekongga and Inpari Sidenuk using SRI, and Inpari Sidenuk using conventional irrigation method.","[Isnawan, Bambang Heri; Susila; Mulyono] Univ Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Fac Agr, Dept Agrotechnol, Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta,"Isnawan, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Fac Agr, Dept Agrotechnol, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",bambang_hi@yahoo.com,"Isnawan, Bambang Heri/AAZ-1102-2020","Isnawan, Bambang Heri/0000-0002-3739-4504",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-619-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2018,172.0,,,,,,155,160,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BP7HZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000562072800031,0

It is possible to improve the economic aspect of the business by applying Multi-criteria Decision Analysis and geographic information systems as a support to decision-making, especially if the user has limited resources or if there are plenty of options at hand, as, for instance, in agricultural production. Through Multi-criteria Decision Analysis and previous research on the subject of analysis, the possibility of modelling the impact on the individual segment of agricultural production is created, not only separately, but as a whole as well. That way, resource management gives the user a realistic possibility for a faster and better production, as well as greater income than it would be possible in the situation of having immense resources available, but which would not be used economically. The paper concludes with recommendations on further actions needed to exploit the full potential of GIS and MCDA.","[Jurisic, Mladen; Plascak, Ivan] Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Ravlic, Sanela] Croatian Employment Serv, Kneza Trpimira 2, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jurisic, M (通讯作者)，Fac Agr Osijek, Vladimira Preloga 1, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",mladen.jurisic@pfos.hr; ivan.plascak@pfos.hr; sanela.ravlic@hzz.hr,"Plaščak, Ivan/AHC-5334-2022; Jurišić, Mladen/AAT-7528-2020","Plaščak, Ivan/0000-0001-8700-4773; Jurišić, Mladen/0000-0002-8105-6983",,,,,19,1,1,3,10,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1705,1721,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300096,0

This article fills that gap. Stalin's war cabinet is characterised according to several criteria: first, the formal status of members of the leadership; second, the system of delegating authority; third, the functioning and competency of the structure of collective leadership; and fourth, Stalin's loyalty to his top associates and the degree of their political immunity. The article demonstrates that the war years saw a relative normalisation' of the dictatorship. These important changes influenced the subsequent development of the Stalinist system of power and the evolution of Soviet authoritarianism after the dictator's death.","[Khlevniuk, Oleg] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Hist & Sociol World War & Its Consequence, Staraya Basmannaya 21-4, Moscow 105066, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Khlevniuk, O (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Hist & Sociol World War & Its Consequence, Staraya Basmannaya 21-4, Moscow 105066, Russia.",okhlevniuk@hse.ru,"Khlevniuk, Oleg V/H-3526-2015",,Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100',"Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian FederationProject 5-100, Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","I am grateful to Yoram Gorliki, Aaron Hale-Dorrell, Natalie Belsky and Seth Bernstein for their valuable comments.

Business education is a relatively new phenomenon in the Ukrainian market of educational services. The constant increase in the need to update knowledge and the increase in requirements for its quality under the conditions of globalization of the educational space require a corresponding offer in the market. The growth of competition in the context of increasing the influence of global factors of the international environment requires to utilize the efficient methods of attracting and retaining customers in most world markets as well as in the markets of Ukraine. Business education is one of the most dynamic sectors of the educational field. The processes of providing services in the business education market require the study and development of certain criteria and standards. The failure of higher educational institutions to solve the development problems of enterprises in the conditions of hyperinflation created the necessity of mastering new market knowledge and skills in the shortest possible time. The experience of economically developed countries also points to the fact that education in entrepreneurship and management is one of the most important factors to successfully complete the transition period to the market economy. However, the foreign experience requires adaptation and rethinking in order to apply the integration of Ukrainian education into the world educational space. During the last decade, Ukrainian business education has demonstrated the activity, dynamism and abilities associated with the assimilation of foreign experience. The significant advantage was the absence of negative attitudes toward any managemental schools of science in particular. In a good sense, such whateverism made it possible to accumulate the educational experience of managers in both American and European business schools. Both occupational education as a whole and business education as an integral part of it are undoubtedly the most important factors of economic growth and socio-economic development at the present stage of the transition to an innovative type of economy. The term business educationis traditionally understood as supplementary education programs, the top of which are MBA programs. The classical understanding of MBA (Master of Business Administration) is post-graduate specialized occupational training of managers of the highest qualification in the field of business. The urgent character of business education in the national practice is countered by the almost completely irregular way of providing this extremely important type of modern education. The point at issue is that at both the state and private levels, business education should become increasingly more international in its nature.","[Kryvoruchko, Viktoriia] Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture,"Kryvoruchko, V (通讯作者)，Odessa State Acad Civil Engn & Architecture, Odessa, Ukraine.",vitycy@rambler.ru,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,66,75,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300008,0

Meanwhile, according to another EU regulation, one criterion for organic food production is its contribution to sustainable development (Regulation (EEC) No. 834/2007). Against this background, one might argue that in spite of their distance to nature RAS are innovative solutions to deal with sustainability issues in food production. The paper will deal with the claim that RAS for aquaculture could be one innovative solution to sustainability issues. In this respect, the picture is ambivalent. In the past, the organic movement (OM) has searched for innovative alternatives to industrial forms of agriculture and food production that are non-sustainable. Hence, the majority of the OM cannot warm to industrial RAS, even though one might argue that these systems comply with many of the European OM's founding principles. While there are potential positive effects for a sustainable development, we might still regard these systems as techno -scientific solutions to social problems. This paper discusses innovation narratives related to RAS from the perspective of post-normal innovation critique. It first presents potential contribution to a more sustainable food sector. It then contrasts these arguments within critical assessments of innovation narratives for sustainable development. Finally, it discusses pitfalls that the OM needed to avoid if it wants to lobby for or against organic certification of RAS.","[Meisch, S.] Univ Tubingen, Int Ctr Eth Sci & Humanities, Wilhelmstr 19, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Stark, M.] Seafood Advisory Ltd, Ey 16, CH-3294 Buren An Der Aare, Switzerland",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Meisch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Int Ctr Eth Sci & Humanities, Wilhelmstr 19, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",simon.meisch@uni-tuebingen.de,,"Meisch, Simon/0000-0003-3388-2305",German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture [2815OE026],German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture,"This paper builds on the report of the project Stakeholder-Studie 'Kreislaufanlagen -Positionen des Okosektors' (Bergleiter et al., 2017) funded by German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (project no. 2815OE026).",,23,0,0,2,7,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,444,449,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_70,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000070,0

Authorizing foreign investors and corporations to bring disputes against governments for the costs associated with regulations negatively impacting future profitability or market share, ISDS has become highly controversial in debates over trade agreements. This article surveys the constellation of early investor-state disputes arbitrated under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to provide analysis of the politico-juridical ideology articulated by this regime and the nature of the class struggle underlying it. The evidence presented suggests that arbitrators have selectively chosen from a body of unsettled US jurisprudence to expand the boundaries of expropriation and, thus, property rights. Such a development has dramatic theoretical and practical consequences. Concretely, it impacts political accountability and has the potential to generate regulatory chill. Theoretically, it illuminates the class struggle unfolding in the current era of de-centered capitalism characterized by transnational production and financial flows. This article asserts that ISDS dispossesses citizens of the ability to successfully translate popular demands for social protection into regulations when such measures conflict with corporate profitability.","[Nichols, Shawn] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Polit, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Nichols, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Polit, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",,,,UC Santa Cruz Regent Fellowship; UC Santa Cruz Politics Department's Summer Research Fellowship; UC Santa Cruz Politics Department's Summer Writing Fellowship,UC Santa Cruz Regent Fellowship; UC Santa Cruz Politics Department's Summer Research Fellowship; UC Santa Cruz Politics Department's Summer Writing Fellowship,The UC Santa Cruz Regent Fellowship; the UC Santa Cruz Politics Department's Summer Research Fellowship and Summer Writing Fellowship.,,80,13,13,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

How to do this is a highly relevant topic not only in Latvia, but also in the euro area overall, where many banks continue to struggle with the legacies of the crisis. The aim of this paper is to characterize the contours of the optimal stability strategy for banks with an emphasis on banks operating in Latvia. Because the development of an effective asset management strategy is an essential part of the stability strategy of any commercial bank, the second aim of this paper is to provide a way of summarising information about the quality and profitability of bank assets as well as to propose some strategies for effective asset management. The authors used both quantitative and qualitative economic methods of including comparative analysis and synthesis, graphical illustration methods, as well as quantitative methods to analyse commercial bank profitability, liquidity, and asset quality. As a result of the empirical analysis, the authors conclude that active liquidity and profitability management allows banks to increase their overall stability and lower the influence of external factors on their performance. A successful asset management strategy should control both for the structure and profitability of assets as well as liabilities (sources of financing).","[Saksonova, Svedana; Solovjova, Irina] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Saksonova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Solovjova, Irina/HLQ-2495-2023","Solovjova, Irina/0000-0002-2790-0848",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,587,599,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500055,0

In order to equalize hospital cost structure and stimulate hospital performance and quality at the same time, the Croatian Government introduced in 2006 the diagnosis-related groups payment scheme called DRG methodology. DRG is a system for classification of acute hospital inpatient treatments which enables standardization of hospital procedures, controlling costs, measuring efficiency, and quality in secondary and tertiary (hospital) health care. If hospitals improve their efficiency, an improvement in the efficiency of the health care system may also be expected. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate relative efficiency of public hospitals in Croatia based on DRG procedure K60B -diabetes without very severe and severe comorbidity and complications. The hospital level data were analysed using Data Envelopment Analysis which indicated that Croatian hospitals, regarding DRG K60B, operate at a similar efficiency level. This leads to the conclusion that introduction of the DRG payment system in Croatian hospitals has justified its purpose, at least within the observed DRGs. If we cumulatively observe the sources and the amounts of relative inefficiency, days of lying should be reduced the most -on average by 16.71%. The research results may serve to health policy makers as guidelines for more efficient use of health resources as this paper provides theoretical and practical contribution to the evaluation of relative hospital efficiency regarding the DRG reimbursement scheme.","[Samarzija, Nikolina Dukic; Blecich, Andrea Arbula] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Najdek, Tomislav] Hlth Ctr Zagreb West, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Samarzija, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",nikolina.dukic.samarzija@efri.hr; andrea.arbula.blecich@efri.hr; tomislav.najdek@dzz-zapad.hr,"Arbula Blecich, Andrea/JMQ-7081-2023; Samaržija, Nikolina Dukić/S-4727-2018; Blecich, Andrea Arbula/R-6647-2018","Arbula Blecich, Andrea/0000-0002-1379-6410; Blecich, Andrea Arbula/0000-0002-1379-6410",Croatian Science Foundation [6558]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.09],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,"This study was founded by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project 6558 Business and Personal Insolvency - the Ways to Overcome Excessive Indebtedness, and by the University of Rijeka under the project: Approaches and Methods of Cost and Management Accounting in Croatian Public Sector (No. 13.02.1.2.09).",,25,2,2,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,358,366,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300036,0

It has become one of the prominent societal problems and therefore on the agenda of many governments as a key problem to cope with. So far it can be observed that great attention of both academic and government communities has been directed towards only one agent in the debt generation process - the borrower/household and its responsibility in mitigating the present level of indebtedness as well as accountable management of future new debt. The neglected problem area is the role of the second agent in the debt contract relationship, and that is the lendermainly the banking sector. The problematization of the responsibility of banks in unsustainable levels of household indebtedness is founded on multiple phenomena as sources of inequality in debt contracting. The first phenomenon that makes banks the superior side of the relationship is massive information asymmetry. Banks are far more knowledgeable on all matters of financial nature than their counterparts (borrowers). The second phenomenon is banks' enormous advantage in resourcefulness, both material (technological) and intangible (intellectual capital) resources. Therefore, it is only fair to focus the research on shedding light on banking sector operations as drivers of excessive household indebtedness. To gain market share and stimulate demand for their financial services, mainly expansion of credit, banks heavily rely on non-price competition tools such as advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, and publicity. Hence, the goal of this research is development of causal links among banking sector advertising activities, their outcomes in credit market developments and personal indebtedness. The empirical analysis of the 15-year time series is performed by using quarterly data on Croatian banking sector advertising expenditures and household sector credits. The results of the Granger-causality analysis indicate that there is a one-way predictive causality in which the advertising expenditures of the banking sector can be used to predict household sector credits as a principal indicator of personal indebtedness.","[Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunja; Dimitric, Mira] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka, Croatia; [Guscic, Darja Kupinic] Media Net Doo, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Skalamera-Alilovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka, Croatia.",dunja.skalamera-alilovic@efri.hr; mira.dimitric@efri.hr; medianet@medianet.hr,"Škalamera-Alilović, Dunja/R-6910-2018; Dimitric, Mira/R-9274-2018","Škalamera-Alilović, Dunja/0000-0003-2346-154X; Dimitric, Mira/0000-0001-6941-5392",Croatian Science Foundation [6558]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.09],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project 6558 Business and Personal Insolvency: The Ways to Overcome Excessive Indebtedness and by the University of Rijeka under the project: Approaches and Methods of Cost and Management Accounting in Croatian Public Sector (No. 13.02.1.2.09).,,34,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,94,105,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700009,0

Every trading position will have the risk-reward ratio (RRR) 3 to I. In addition, another trading positions on the GBP/USD currency pair will be opened at the same time each day, without technical analysis. The time of entry into position will be indicated by past high liquidity on a given currency pair at a given time with a similar risk-reward-ratio (RRR) 3 to 1. We want to answer the question whether it is preferable to use the technical analysis indicators or to open a trading position randomly in intraday trading. In other words, this article aims to compare the strategy of technical analysis and the random strategy in intraday trading concerning the profitability of these trades.

This article's perspective - indicators of turnover are based on the data of the financial reports of the companies from the 19th century. Eventually the annual statements of the companies were enhanced with new components such as: Accrued income, Accrued liabilities, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, Investment property which in the 19th century were not shown on debtors and liabilities reports. Studying international scientific literature and articles - the authors analyzed methods of turnover ratio calculations from various schools of financial analyses. In the analyses of financial statements not all the components of turnover ratios should be used for an accurate and reliable result of turnover ratio calculations.

We find that the adjustment process is asymmetric and depends on the type of risk, its magnitude, the firm's current leverage, and its financial status. We also show that firms with financial surpluses and above-target leverage adjust their leverage more rapidly when firm-specific risk is low and when macroeconomic risk is high. Firms with financial deficits and below-target leverage adjust their capital structure more quickly when both types of risks are low.

In particular, we present empirical evidence to address this issue based on the Colombian experience. This study relies on two main issues. The first is to verify whether the adoption of inflation targeting in Colombia affected the discretionary fiscal component in the period 2004-2014. The second issue is to analyze whether the monetary credibility amplified the effect of the monetary policy on changes in the discretionary fiscal component. The results denote that inflation targeting causes an impact on fiscal policy in Colombia.

We tackle this question using the well-established Laubach-Williams model to estimate the unobservable equilibrium real interest rate and compare it to the actual real rate. In light of the considerable increase in heterogeneity among EU member countries since the beginning of the financial crisis, we apply our approach to 12 euro-area countries to provide country-level answers to the question of secular stagnation. The presence of secular stagnation in a number of euro-area countries has important implications for ECB decision-making (such as, voting power in the Governing Council) and EU governance. Our results indicate that secular stagnation is not a significant threat to most euro-area countries, with one possible exception: Greece.","[Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] Ctr European Policy Studies CEPS, Brussels, Belgium",University of Duisburg Essen,"Klose, J (通讯作者)，Tech Hsch Mittelhessen Business Sch, Eichgartenallee 6, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",jens.klose@w.thm.de,"Klose, Jens/H-3800-2019","Klose, Jens/0000-0001-6234-5272",,,,,47,16,16,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The research design of this paper is to restrict the sample to sibling pairs who are separated between schools, where one enters high school and the other middle school. Because of school separation, sibling pairs face independent health shocks from own school peers. The identification strategy further exploits variations in individual health across symptoms to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity, which flexibly partials out family correlated effects. Estimation results show that the sibling spillover effect is large as a one-standard deviation increase in one sibling's frequency of developing a stomach ache or a loss of appetite increases the other sibling's frequency of having the same symptom by about 55% of a standard deviation. Further investigation suggests that the effect is not due to spillovers in drinking alcohol or depression, but probably due to the spread of contagious illnesses like the stomach flu.

Under the stochastic volatility and jump diffusion stochastic volatility models, the distributions of the hedged portfolio return are symmetric and have more Gaussian-like thin-tails.","[Lee, Kyungsub] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Stat, Gyongsan 38541, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Seo, Byoung Ki] UNIST, Sch Business Adm, Ulsan 44919, South Korea",Yeungnam University; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Seo, BK (通讯作者)，UNIST, Sch Business Adm, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",bkseo@unist.ac.kr,"Seo, Byoung Ki/G-3607-2019","Seo, Byoung Ki/0000-0002-0114-9347; Lee, Kyungsub/0000-0001-9499-0671",UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) [1.120071.01]; Yeungnam University Research Grant,UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology); Yeungnam University Research Grant,Byoung Ki Seo was supported by the 2012 Research Fund (1.120071.01) of UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology).

However, despite the large number of accessibility measures available in the literature, they are not widely used to support urban planning practices. Much has been said about the implementation gap of Planning Support Systems with a significant attention paid to usability and more recently to the usefulness of Accessibility Instruments. The paper aims to assess the usefulness of a specific accessibility instrument the Structural Accessibility Layer (SAL) and by doing so exploring the strengths of accessibility instruments holding similar characteristics. To this end, we follow a multidimensional assessment framework under development in the Planning Support System literature. This paper explores the main findings of a workshop bringing together local planning practitioners and the developers of the SAL in an experiment using the SAL. The assessment of usefulness of SAL identified the instrument's strengths with regard to insight into participants' assumptions, communication, commitment and development of shared language. Regardless, the low fit between planning concerns of participants (in this case study context) and of the SAL seemed to limit its potential use in practice and as such undermines the strengths identified in the usefulness assessment. The assessment developed here only partially confirmed objectives and purposes defined for the SAL. Results confirm the usefulness of the SAL as diagnosis tool, however, the ability of the SAL to contribute to a joint thinking of land use and transport constraints on mobility was not confirmed. Finally, this research raises questions on the role of PSS in changing strategic thinking in planning and how this might conflict with the current PSS research concern in improving usefulness of tools.

Using quarterly data for a sample of EMU countries during the period 2000-13, we estimate fixed-effect panel models with Driscoll and Kraay standard errors that are robust to general forms of spatial and temporal dependence. Our main results can be summarised as follows: first, we suggest that the sudden stop' of capital inflow towards the peripheral sovereign debt triggered a re-segmentation of financial markets and economic systems along national borders, with negative implications for risk-sharing and the efficient allocation of capital. The home bias' effect - that is the increase in the share of sovereign debt held by domestic banks - worsened the country-specific risk because the twin crisis (sovereign and banking) began to be conceived as more closely intertwined within countries than before. Second, the structure of international trade helps to account for the geographic scope of contagion, even after controlling for macroeconomic and fiscal vulnerabilities. Finally, the substitution effect' of public debt securities of stand-alone emerging countries has affected more the sovereign spreads in the core than in the periphery.","[Cutrini, Eleonora; Galeazzi, Giorgio] Univ Macerata, Dept Law, Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"Cutrini, E (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dept Law, Macerata, Italy.",,,"Cutrini, Eleonora/0000-0001-7007-6076",,,,,61,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1718,1749,,10.1111/twec.12470,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900002,0

Generating technologies can substitute via two distinct, but interdependent mechanisms: i) utilization-i.e. adjustment of operations of existing capacity and ii) expansion-i.e. decommissioning and construction of capacity. We develop a framework for analyzing these interdependent mechanisms, then construct and validate an empirical model of the U.S. electricity sector using recent data. Assuming current low gas prices persist, increasing utilization of gas (at the expense of higher-emitting coal) will drive higher returns to gas capacity. As a result, under our business-as-usual scenario for 2030 (no CPP) we project approximately 26% less CO2 emissions than 2005 levels, indicating that the CPP target could be met with only limited policy intervention.","[Peters, Jeffrey C.] Stanford Univ, Complex Syst Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.] GTAP, W Lafayette, IN USA",Stanford University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Peters, JC (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Complex Syst Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jcpeters@stanford.edu; hertel@purdue.edu,,,,,,,51,8,9,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2017,38.0,5,,,,,39,66,,10.5547/01956574.38.5.jpet,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FE2PY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408059400003,0

There is some evidence of exchange rate volatility to have significant impact on real total exports in the long run, but more evidence of exchange rate volatility is found to have significant impact on sub-categories of real total exports in the short run. The impact of exchange rate volatility differs across bilateral exports. The impact of exchange rate volatility on exports can be negative or positive.

Height is linked to various health outcomes such as morbidity and mortality and has consequences on the societal level. The aim of this study was to describe small-area variation of height and associated factors among young men in Switzerland. Data from 175,916 conscripts (aged between 18.50 and 20.50 years) was collected between 2005 and 2011, which represented approximately 90% of the corresponding birth cohorts. These were analysed using Gaussian hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework to investigate the spatial pattern of mean height across postcodes. The models varied both in random effects and degree of adjustment (professional status, area-based socioeconomic position, and language region). We found a strong spatial structure for mean height across postcodes. The range of height differences between mean postcode level estimates was 3.40 cm according to the best fitting model, with the shorter conscripts coming from the Italian and French speaking parts of Switzerland. There were positive socioeconomic gradients in height at both individual and area-based levels. Spatial patterns for height persisted after adjustment for individual factors, but not when language region was included. Socioeconomic position and cultural/natural boundaries such as language borders and mountain passes are shaping patterns of height for Swiss conscripts. Small area mapping of height contributes to the understanding of its cofactors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Results of panel logit, ANCOVA and change-score analysis are indicative of positive impacts from use of a number of FWAs, including homeworking having positive effects for men and women on job and leisure satisfaction. However, findings reveal gaps in availability and use of FWAs, and highlight the gendered nature of flexible employment. Flexi-time, the most common FWA among men, has positive effects as it facilitates management of household responsibilities while maintaining full-time employment. Part-time and homeworking are also positive, consistent with men using FWAs with a greater degree of choice. Women more often are constrained in their use of FWAs, often into working reduced hours. Consequently, FWAs have negative impacts for some women, on job (part-time when used for extended periods, flexi-time), leisure (job-share, flexi-time) and life satisfaction (job-share).","[Wheatley, Daniel] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England",Nottingham Trent University,"Wheatley, D (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England.",daniel.wheatley@ntu.ac.uk,,"Wheatley, Daniel/0000-0002-6753-2867",,,,,53,112,134,32,234,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In particular, the core-stability concept produces an encouraging result that does not seem to be supported by reality. We extend the game-theoretic model based on this concept by introducing macroeconomic effects of emission reduction measures in multiple countries. The computable general equilibrium model DART and damage functions from the RICE model are used to quantify the theoretical model. Contrary to the classical model, we find that, under damages in the IPCC range, the core of the resulting cooperative game is empty and no stable global agreement exists. This is mainly due to fossil fuel exporting countries, which are negatively affected by lower fossil fuel prices resulting from emission reduction measures.","[Kersting, Jan; Duscha, Vicki] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Weitzel, Matthias] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Weitzel, Matthias] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Kersting, J (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",jan.kersting@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Weitzel, Matthias/AFM-9374-2022","Weitzel, Matthias/0000-0003-3764-3731","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LA1127A, 01LA1127C]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Previous versions of this paper were presented at the 27th PhD Workshop on International Climate Policy in Berlin, May 2015, and at the 21st Annual EAERE Conference in Helsinki, June 2015.

However, this view has recently been challenged by findings from another research domain, public health research, reporting little or no effect of PTP-based interventions. We argue that these conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of PTP-based measures are due to different understandings of which research designs should be used: Transportation research tends to be based on large-scale quasi-experimental designs whereas public health research tends to favor experimental designs such as randomized control trials (RCTs). Consequently, we argue, the discrepancy may at least partly be resolved by a more nuanced position on what empirical evidence really matters when evaluating if an intervention is effective or not. In the empirical part of the paper, we meta-analytically re-analyze ten quasi-experimental PTP evaluation studies and report an experimental RCT-based study testing the effectiveness of a PTP strategy implemented in a major German city. Including all information in one meta-analytical synthesis yields a standardized effect size estimate of Cohen's h = 0.12, documenting a small but reliable effect of PTP interventions. When implementing a PTP like one of those analyzed in this paper, in other words, we can expect an average reduction of the car modal split share of about 5 percentage points. We close by discussing the implications of our results for future PTP evaluation studies and the dispute about what kind of empirical evidence really matters when evaluating the effectiveness of PTP measures.

The methodology used is a survival analysis to assess the tourists' repeat patterns. To test the model, a database of 4612 observations was employed, which was obtained from a survey of international tourists. Only repeat visitors with more than two visits over the years were considered for the purpose of the research. The study finds that a combination of socio-demographic characteristics, expectation/satisfaction, trip purpose, pull motivations and regional destination has a positive effect on repeat patterns, confirming that tourists' willingness to repeat visits to Portugal is far from ceasing. Based on those tourists to Portugal who declared when they started to visit the country, and the number of years of their repeat visits, the article contributes to the literature by introducing new methods of assessing tourists' repeat patterns for destinations.","[Correia, Antonia] Univ Algarve, CEFAGE, Faro, Portugal; [Correia, Antonia] Univ Europeia, Faro, Portugal; [Serra, Jaime] Univ Evora, CIDEHUS, Evora, Portugal; [Artal-Tur, Andres] Tech Univ Cartagena UPCT, Murcia, Spain",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade Europeia; University of Evora; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Correia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia, Faro, Portugal.;Correia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Algarve, Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ CEFAGE UE, Faro, Portugal.",ahcorreia@gmail.com,"Serra, Jaime/H-6740-2019; Correia, Antónia/A-5353-2010","Serra, Jaime/0000-0002-0299-4649; Correia, Antónia/0000-0002-6707-8289; Artal-Tur, Andres/0000-0003-3423-8570","FCT - National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology; COMPETE; FEDER, Portugal [UID/HIS/00057/2013 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007702)]; European Union within the context of the European Commission-FEMISE project on 'Support to economic research, studies and dialogue of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership' [ENPI/2014/354-494]; [UID/ECO/04007/2013 UID/ECO/04007/2013 COMPETE: POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659 - CEFAGE-UE]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/04007/2013, UID/HIS/00057/2013] Funding Source: FCT","FCT - National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology; COMPETE; FEDER, Portugal(European Union (EU)); European Union within the context of the European Commission-FEMISE project on 'Support to economic research, studies and dialogue of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership'; ; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded with a grant from the FCT - National Funding Agency for Science, Research and Technology, COMPETE, FEDER, Portugal 2020 under the project UID/HIS/00057/2013 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007702) - CIDEHUS (Jaime Serra), and UID/ECO/04007/2013 UID/ECO/04007/2013 COMPETE: POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007659 - CEFAGE-UE (Antonia Correia).

This paper introduces a new dataset on earmarked aid, which alternatively has been referred to as multi-bi, restricted, non-core or trust fund aid. The data make it possible to track the rise of the new aid channel over an extended time period and in greater detail regarding, e.g., the implementing multilateral organizations. The data include more than 100,000 earmarked projects of 23 OECD donors to 290 multilateral institutions from 1990 to 2012. We graphically illustrate the patterns in earmarked aid for all actors: donor governments and their aid-providing agencies, multilateral organizations, and recipient countries. We also highlight promising research questions that can be analyzed with the multi-bi data. In a first empirical application of the data, we analyze four suggested donor motives for earmarked aid at the donor-recipient level. Contrary to donor claims, we find that earmarked aid and bilateral aid target the same recipients. We also find evidence that some donors use earmarked aid to bypass recipient countries with weak governance. Overall, our explorative analysis suggests that earmarked aid serves many purposes and that donors use it in different ways. This calls for more fine-grained research on the reasons and implications for earmarked aid.","[Eichenauer, Vera Z.] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Eichenauer, Vera Z.] KOF ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Reinsberg, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Reinsberg, Bernhard] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Zurich; University of Cambridge,"Reinsberg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.;Reinsberg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",br385@cam.ac.uk,,"Eichenauer, Vera Z./0000-0002-0440-3136",Swiss Network for International Studies,Swiss Network for International Studies,"The authors thank Tilman Bruck, Axel Dreher, Andreas Fuchs, Hinnerk Gnutzmann, Elena McLean, Alexandra Rudolph, Rainer Thiele, Felicity Vabulas, participants at the Beyond Basic Questions Workshop 2015 (Hannover), the Conference on Development Economics Group of the German Economic Association 2015 (Kiel), and the Political Economy of International Organizations Conference 2016 (Salt Lake City, UT) for helpful comments on previous versions of this paper, Franziska Volk and Sven Kunze for valuable research assistance, and Jamie Parsons for proofreading.

This paper suggests a novel, two-dimensional concept to measure the financialisation of sovereign debt management (SDM): (1) the reliance on financial markets as a governance mechanism and (2) the adoption of a sense-making framework grounded in financial economics. We split this concept into nine indicators and apply it to data from 23 OECD countries between 1980 and 2010.

The variables of a common border and geographical distance showed that proximity was essential to explain tourism demand for Brazil. The exchange rate was positively correlated with tourism demand.

The reforms have varied in terms of structure, market mechanisms, and regulation. However, the passage of time calls for taking stock of the performance of the reforms in developing countries. This paper surveys the empirical literature on electricity sector reforms and draws some conclusions with a view to the future. Overall, the reforms have tended to improve the technical efficiency of the sector. The macroeconomic benefits of reforms are less clear and remain difficult to identify. Also, the gains from the reforms have often not trickled down to consumers because of institutional and regulatory weaknesses. In order to achieve lasting benefits, reforms need to adopt measures that align their pursuit of economic efficiency with those of equity and provision of access. Reforms can deliver more economic benefits and alleviate poverty when the poor have access to electricity. New technologies and institutional capacity building can help improve the performance of reforms.","[Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Nepal, Rabindra] Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Timilsina, Govinda R.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Durham University; Charles Darwin University; The World Bank,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206",Development Research Group of the World Bank,Development Research Group of the World Bank,"The authors are thankful to insightful comments from John Besant-Jones, Mike Toman, Stephen Littlechild, Subhes Bhattarchryya, Anupama Sen, Jevgenijs Steinbuks, four anonymous referees, and the editor on earlier versions of this paper.

The sample period is 1975 M01 to 2015 M06. The study utilizes the housing price index of each of the 50 states and Washington DC to form nine census region-based markets, or portfolios and then employs switching and quantile regressions to examine the spatial and time-varying disparities of housing return dispersions and investors' herding behavior. The study finds that the degree of herding varies across regimes, regions and conditional distributions. The regime-specific herd formation may be partially originated by extreme housing market conditions, bull and bear housing market conditions, uncertainty in national financial markets, economic recessions and uncertainty of economic policies. The bull housing markets exhibits stronger effects on return dispersion than down markets, which is consistent with the flight-to-safety consensus behavior of investors. The study also finds that positive and negative linear and nonlinear returns magnify dispersions in an asymmetric manner. The increase in co-movement and interdependence of state and regional-level housing markets returns among geographically diverse states and regions offer little hope of successful geographical portfolio diversification strategies for U.S housing market investors. Moreover, time-invariant modeling may yield incorrect inferences regarding herd formation in regional housing markets.","[Ngene, Geoffrey M.; Sohn, Daniel P.] Mercer Univ, Stetson Sch Business & Econ, 1501 Mercer Univ Dr, Macon, GA 31207 USA; [Hassan, M.

Lundtorp and Wanhill find that the logistic growth model represents the first phases of the TALC model. However, since the logistic model assumes a fixed tourism market ceiling, it fails to explain the poststagnation stage, where rejuvenation, decline, or any other intermediate possibility may arise. Taking into account the data of passenger flows to Bornholm from 1912 to 2001 collected by Lundtorp and Wanhill, the authors find that the superposition of several logistic growth models fits better with these data. Then they propose a multilogistic growth model, where investment or innovation in the tourism sector boosts the addition of new logistic curves which superpose the old ones. The continuous birth and superposition of these new life cycles is not free; it requires the purposive effort of entrepreneurs and governments seeking new markets and the improvement of infrastructures.","[Albaladejo, Isabel P.; Pilar Martinez-Garcia, Maria] Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Albaladejo, IP (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Metodos Cuantitat Econ, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",isalba@um.es,"Martínez-García, María Pilar/K-7693-2014; Albaladejo, Isabel P./F-2388-2016","Martínez-García, María Pilar/0000-0003-2845-9799; Albaladejo, Isabel P./0000-0001-7441-7392","MEC [ECO2013-45698, ECO2008-01551/ECON, ECO2011-24352]; FEDER funds; COST Action IS1104 The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation","MEC; FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); COST Action IS1104 The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the support from the MEC under projects ECO2013-45698 (I.

Obtained distributions of the hidden variables demonstrate that the considered industries migrate asynchronously trough credit classes. Since downgrading probabilities are less affected by the unobserved tendencies, estimated by Monte-Carlo simulations distributions of defaults, exhibit lighter, than for the known coupling models, tails for schemes with asynchronously moving industries.

Electrification, via mass market adoption of plug-in vehicles (i.e. battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles), has emerged as a front runner for road transport across the globe, but there are concerns that the pace and extent implied by many modeling studies is problematic and that assessment of (a) the heterogeneity in the market, (b) other low carbon vectors (e.g. conventional hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell) and (c) life cycle energy and environmental impacts have been relatively neglected. This paper aims to fill these gaps by examining the timing, scale and impacts of the uptake of plug-in vehicles in the heterogeneous UK car market from a consumer perspective. To achieve this aim it (a) brings together a bespoke disaggregated model of the transport-energy environment system (the UK Transport Carbon Model) with previous work by the authors on heterogeneity in the demand for and supply of plug-in vehicles and (b) applies the improved model to develop future low carbon scenarios that assess the potential impact of different investment pathways and policy approaches to the electrification of cars with the view to meeting the UK's legally binding carbon budgets to 2050. The results show the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity in and dynamic nature of the car market in terms of new technology adoption by private consumers, so called 'user choosers' and fleet managers, as well as accounting for potential effects on wider life cycle emissions resulting from different uptake pathways. It allows an assessment of the effectiveness of different policy instruments, market conditions (vehicle supply, private vs fleet market, vehicle segments) and social factors (consumer awareness, range anxiety, perceived charging requirements) on different consumer segments, thus providing more policy-focused conclusions on the likely pathways to high penetration of plug-in vehicles that may be required to meet future carbon and air quality targets.

(European Finance Review 2:135-156, 1998) results using log daily returns on S&P 500 Index from January 1992 to September 1994. This failure leads to a close investigation of the computational problems associated with finding maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the popular VG model. Both standard econometric software, such as R, low level programming languages, such as Matlab, and non-standard optimization software, such as Ezgrad described in Tucci (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 26:1739-1764, 2002), are used. The complexity of the log-likelihood function is studied. It is shown that it looks very complicated, with many local optima, and may be incredibly sensitive to very small changes in the sample used. Adding or removing a single observation may cause huge changes both in the maximum of the log-likelihood function and in the estimated parameter values. An intuitive procedure which works nicely both when implemented in R and in Matlab is presented.","[Cervellera, Gian P.; Tucci, Marco P.] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Piazza S Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Tucci, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dipartimento Econ Polit & Stat, Piazza S Francesco 7, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",cervellera@unisi.it; tucci@unisi.it,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We use a two-stage data envelopment analysis window analysis, to detect efficiency trends and resort to both semiparametric pooled-truncated and panel data estimators to evaluate the determinants of the efficiency changes in TDs over time. Moreover, we test for the presence of spatial dependence in the efficiency of TDs. The results reveal that the WHL does not play a significant role in enhancing technical efficiency of TDs. These empirical findings are robust to alternative estimators and model specifications.

The authors examine the impact of tourism using two separate indicators - tourism receipts per capita and visitor arrivals per capita. Using the augmented Solow production function and the autoregressive distributed lag bounds procedure, they also incorporate trade openness and financial development and account for structural breaks in series. The results show the evidence of cointegration between the variables. Assessing the long-run results using both indicators of tourism demand, it is noted that the elasticity coefficient of tourism is 0.13 and 0.10 when considering visitor arrivals and tourism receipts (in per capita terms), respectively. Notably, the impact of tourism demand is marginally higher with visitor arrivals. The elasticity of trade openness is 0.19, that of financial development is 0.09 and that of capital share is 0.15. In the short run, the coefficient of tourism is marginally negative, and for financial development and trade openness, it is 0.01 and 0.18, respectively. The Granger causality tests show bidirectional causation between tourism and output per capita, financial development and tourism and trade openness and tourism demand, duly indicating the feedback or mutually reinforcing impact between the variables and providing evidence that tourism is central to enhancing the key sectors and the overall income level.","[Shahbaz, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ Bolton, Bolton, England; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Ivanov, Stanislav] Varna Univ Management, 13A Oborishte St, Varna 9000, Bulgaria; [Loganathan, Nanthakumar] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); University of the South Pacific; University of Bolton; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Varna University of Management; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ivanov, S (通讯作者)，Varna Univ Management, 13A Oborishte St, Varna 9000, Bulgaria.",stanislav.ivanov@vumk.eu,"Loganathan, Nanthakumar/I-7325-2012; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Ivanov, Stanislav Hristov/D-7692-2012","Loganathan, Nanthakumar/0000-0002-3221-6629; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896; Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Ivanov, Stanislav Hristov/0000-0002-6851-5823",,,,,72,54,55,1,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Li zehou proposed the equation in order to illustrate the complexity and richness of aesthetic feeling, but it cannot withstand scrutiny in many aspects. The number of the elements, the definition of the four elements and the relationship between each other are all difficult to give a clear explanation.

Thanks to various commercializing (or 'neoliberalizing') reforms introduced in the early 2000s, in the form of a new for-profit business model and a deregulated and de-supervised 'enabling environment', after zow the microcredit sector began to experience explosive growth, and it soon became one of the world's largest and most profitable microcredit sectors. The standard narrative emerged to the effect that it has been responsible for a large number of positive outcomes, especially with regard to poverty reduction, rural agricultural development and all-round sustainable local economic development. As in very many developing countries of late, however, and against the background of a mounting over-indebtedness-driven microcredit crisis in Cambodia that could potentially destmy the sector, this positive interpretation has come under serious independent scrutiny for perhaps the first time. The author finds that the upbeat narrative governing Cambodia's microcredit sector does not hold true in practice. The paper reflects on what the major drawbacks to the microcredit model are. that have emerged in recent years. It concludes that microcredit has contributed to frustrating and blocking Cambodia's post -war reconstruction and development objectives while, not coincidentally, spectacularly enriching the narrow domestic, expatriate and foreign elite that now manages and owns Cambodia's microcredit sector.","[Bateman, Milford] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Bateman, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia.",milfordbateman@yahoo.com,,,,,,,60,1,1,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

Writers such as Geoffrey Ingham and David Graeber have revived the chartalist position that money is essentially a creature of the state, whose primary function is to measure value or debt. In this paper, I argue that this is a wrong turning. I first clarify the conceptual underpinnings of Ingham's treatment of money as an 'institutional fact', a concept drawn from Searle. I clarify the sense in which this argument establishes that the state 'creates' money and show that this sense is quite limited. It is a theory of how something comes to be accepted as money, rather than a theory of why there is money in the first place, and it gives no account of money's value. Finally, I sketch an alternative way of looking at the relationship between states and money.

The challenges connected with import substitution as well as new opportunities opening before agro-industrial enterprises make us analyze questions of food security more deeply. The main objective of our research is to estimate the level of regional food security, to identify the factors providing food security, to create the model of food security, and to develop recommendations for agrarian policy improvement. In the article we consider the conditions and state of agro-industrial complex in Chelyabinsk Region. Discovered features and main tendencies in this sector define key problems, including imperfection of the contractual relations, high entrance barriers, and technological lag. The existing agrarian policy in Russia demonstrates low level of effectiveness. It must be directed to improve the contractual relations in the sector as the main condition of regional food security achievement, which demands to reduce a chain of contractors farmers-manufacturers-merchandisers-consumers by effective regulation of all agents' relationship.","[Bents, Daria; Silova, Elena] Chelyabinsk State Univ, Inst Econ Business & Adm, Chelyabinsk, Russia",Chelyabinsk State University,"Bents, D (通讯作者)，Chelyabinsk State Univ, Inst Econ Business & Adm, Chelyabinsk, Russia.",benz@csu.ru,"Benz, Daria/M-9750-2016; Silova, Elena/F-4228-2017","Benz, Daria/0000-0003-1257-248X;",[MK-6017.2015.6],,The article is prepared within program of the President's grant No MK-6017.2015.6.,,11,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-39919-5; 978-3-319-39918-8,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2017,4.0,,,,,,217,229,,10.1007/978-3-319-39919-5_17,0.0,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2AH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407615400017,0

The goal of the investigation undertaken in the paper is to assess usefulness of these distant poles of equity styles and evaluate their performance against trending patterns of the market. The method is experimental and in order to assure robustness of results it employs 5 consecutive four-year datasets from 2009 to 2016 and three conceptually different methods of portfolio selection, setting the S&P 500 Index as benchmark. The results indicate that superiority of equity styles and selection methods is contingent on market cycle: in bull markets with steady growth, equity styles with small/low polarity seem more dependable, but when market price patterns change between bull and bear markets, big/high poles seem guarantee better performance.","[Boda, Martin; Kanderova, Maria] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Boda, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Quantitat Methods & Informat Syst, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; maria.kanderova@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898",[1/0554/16],,The paper arose in fulfilment of the VEGA project # 1/0554/16 Alternatives to replicating portfolio selection in the conditions of frequent rebalancing.,,17,0,0,0,1,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,43,57,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.04,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200004,0

The presented contribution concentrates on the perception of the concepts SELF and the CELEBRITY by adolescents. The study presents results of original exploratory research composed of two phases. The first phase of study applies a method of semantic differential reflecting how adolescents perceive selected celebrities with regards to attractiveness, credibility and likeability. Profiles of the SELF and CELEBRITY concepts are then analysed concentrating on the activation of the transactional analysis ego states. Results of the second phase of the study present how age cohorts of adolescents perceive examined concepts along the lines of dominant ego states. The design of the research study demonstrates the application of transactional analysis as the original psychological theory in the research of marketing communications. Using this innovative method we have recorded the perception of celebrities in social advertising among adolescents. It highlights the specific perception of the phenomenon of celebrity at the level of the mensa ego state-Parent, Adult and Child within the defined target group. The application of transactional analysis concentrated solely on the category of recommended celebrities introduces an innovative approach of examining this phenomenon with a high potential for forming the basis of the further practical application of celebrity support.","[Bulanda, Ivana; Chalanyova, Olga; Koprda, Tomas] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Dept Mass Media Commun & Advertising, Drazovska 4, Nitra 94974, Slovakia",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Bulanda, I (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Dept Mass Media Commun & Advertising, Drazovska 4, Nitra 94974, Slovakia.",ibulanda@ukf.sk; olga.chalanyova@ukf.sk; tkoprda@ukf.sk,,,project VEGA: Celebrity in social advertising and their preference at adolescents [1/0216/15],project VEGA: Celebrity in social advertising and their preference at adolescents,The paper was supported by a grant for scientific project VEGA No. 1/0216/15: Celebrity in social advertising and their preference at adolescents.,,36,0,0,1,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,343,353,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000035,0

We improve on existing estimates by accounting for emissions attributable to domestically and internationally imported goods using data describing bilateral trade between U.S. states and with international countries and regions. This paper presents two major findings. First, attributing emissions to states on a consumption basis leads to very different state-level emissions responsibilities than when attributed on a production basis; for example, California's emissions are over 25 percent higher. Second, heterogeneity of emissions across trading partners significantly affects the indirect emissions intensity of consumption (kg of carbon per $ of consumption), so regional differences in intensity across the U.S. go well beyond direct energy consumption. These findings have implications for evaluating the distributional impacts of national climate policies and for understanding differing incentives to implement state-level policies.","[Caron, Justin; Metcalf, Gilbert E.; Reilly, John] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caron, Justin] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA USA; [Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Tufts University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Caron, J (通讯作者)，3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",justin.caron@hec.ca,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-FG02-94ER61937]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [XA-83600001-1]; Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science under DE-FG02-94ER61937, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under XA-83600001-1 and other government, industry, and foundation sponsors of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

While the former has attracted considerable research efforts for decades the latter, home parking, has recently become subject to increasing research interest. We use evidence from the 2013/14 Norwegian National Travel Survey, and combine this with additional geographical context data. In this way, we analyse the impact of parking availability at home and at destination on car use, while controlling for different urban contexts like housing and job density, and population density. The analysis is divided into three. The first part links car use to availability and payment arrangements of workplace parking. The second is concerned with the impact of home parking accessibility and car use. The third set of regressions looks at the combined effect of parking at trip start and the trip end on car use. Reduced access to free workplace parking stands out as one of the most effective ways of reducing car use on work trips. Maximum parking standards are therefore important parts of an urban planner's toolbox. Workplace parking fees can be effective when parking capacity is abundant and especially so if payment is made on a daily basis. Car use is in fact almost doubled where employees can pay monthly instead of daily. Limited access to parking at home also affects car use. The decision to drive decreases with increasing walking distance to the car park, especially in densely built-up areas. Restricted parking both at home and at the trip destination add up to very low odds of car use. Parking restrictions will have the greatest effect in compact cities. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Since 2011, there are ongoing negotiations on the proposal for a Directive on the unified European financial transaction tax (FTT). The initial EU-wide proposal came into question, mostly because of the Member's disagreement about the issues of how the tax will apply to derivative trades, and to transactions executed by pension funds. It is intended that FTT will be applied in just ten member states under the enhanced cooperation legislative mechanism. Altough the scope and objectives of the original FTT proposal have been limited in the latest modified proposal, it is expected that general impacts on EU financial system and economy are still significant. The aim of this paper is to present all the potential effects, implications and restrictions of the FTT introduction. These effects concern trading volume and speculation, liquidity, asset price volatiliy, asset prices and the cost of capital, cascading and intersectoral distortions, financial stability and budget revenues.

In the world of business for many years accounting has been a system which delivers financial information as well as information supplementing data presented in financial reports. The annual report of an enterprise is the main tool used for communicating this information to external stakeholders. The needs of stakeholders expand the scope of the information reported by a business adding new areas in which the company has become involved in. In accounting the term innovation has not been defined in relation to financial reporting. As a result our research issue has been formed as a following question: should annual reports contain information regarding innovations and the innovativeness of enterprises? Does this area of a company's activity find reflection in annual reports and does the management acknowledge this information to be important enough to present it to stakeholders? The industrial era put more emphasis on production and product innovation and accounting related literature reflects this point of view. However, nowadays it is activities other than production that require more and more attention. With the end of the 20th century and within the postindustrial age the role of trading in economy has become more pronounced. The analysis of the issue of innovation from the perspective of a trading company will allow reaching conclusions regarding the character of marketing innovation in the reporting process of these enterprises.","[Dyhdalewicz, Anna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Dyhdalewicz, A (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Bialystok, Poland.",a.dyhdalewicz@pb.edu.p,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education,"Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The research has been carried out the framework of work S/WZ/02/15 and funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education,,20,3,3,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,629,638,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300062,0

These means are replaced by the state in the form of public income and have to be returned to them in the form of qualitative budgetary funds. During the state decentralization, there were used such progressive techniques as: programmer and target method; strategic and medium-term planning; horizontal transfers; dissertation method; key performance indicators.","[Goncharova, Victoria; Golynska, Olesia] Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Odessa Reg Inst Publ Adm, Odessa, Ukraine",National Academy of Public Administration under the President of Ukraine,"Goncharova, V (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Publ Adm President Ukraine, Odessa Reg Inst Publ Adm, Odessa, Ukraine.",vicamai@mail.ru; alesiaa@ukr.net,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,420,425,,,,,,6,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300033,0

We show that if the socio-economic institution that structures interactions between individuals can be represented by a supermodular game, individuals tend to become more homogeneous in terms of altruism as spillover effects increase. This implies that people living close to one another and engaging in joint production, such as irrigation agriculture in a rural village, are more likely to exhibit similar levels of altruism than those living apart and engaging in more or less independent work.","[Goto, Hideaki] Int Univ Japan, Grad Sch Int Relat, 777 Kokusai Cho, Minami Uonuma, Niigata 9497277, Japan",,"Goto, H (通讯作者)，Int Univ Japan, Grad Sch Int Relat, 777 Kokusai Cho, Minami Uonuma, Niigata 9497277, Japan.",h-goto@iuj.ac.jp,,,Waseda University [2012A-937],Waseda University,"The author is indebted to two anonymous referees and the coordinating editor, Luis Santos-Pinto for their detailed and insightful comments.

The local Japanese rating agencies were widely understood to be compromised by their links to government and banks. Why have the influences of the American agencies in Japan diminished, while the local Japanese agencies survived? We emphasise the concept of 'systemic support' as a solution to this puzzle. Our broadened definition of systemic support incorporates dominant elites' support and protection of subordinates in exchange for loyalty and obedience. We argue Japanese society's anti-liberal, anti-free market norms (epitomised by systemic support) are a form of counter-hegemony, and this has resisted American financial hegemony and prevented capitalist dominance from severing long-term social relations (including management-labour alliances). Credit rating in Japan is an ideational battlefield between the market liberalisation and anti-free market camps within the Japanese elite. The American agencies' market friendly, short-term profit-seeking mental framework clashes with the continuing attachment to systemic support in Japan. Similar conflicts can be witnessed in other constrained market economies in Asia and Europe, where corporate bailouts often occur, and local agencies compete against the American majors.","[Gotoh, Fumihito; Sinclair, Timothy J.] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Sinclair, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",timothy.sinclair@warwick.ac.uk,"Gotoh, Fumihito/M-6665-2019","Gotoh, Fumihito/0000-0002-3931-8564",,,,,58,6,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Two statuses whether the process is in control or out of control are considered to define the states of Markov Chain. And a numerical example is provided to compare the performances of three control charts in terms of AATS and EL. The results show that the performance of SVSSI control chart is better than other charts. Further, the genetic algorithm is used to search the optimal solution of the SVSSI T-2 control chart.","[Gu, Li-Jun; Tang, Qing-Guo] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Gu, LJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gulijunsho@outlook.com; tangqguo@163.com,,,Humanity and Social Science Research and Planning Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [14YJA910004]; National Social Science Foundation [16BTJ019]; Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [BK20151481],Humanity and Social Science Research and Planning Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; National Social Science Foundation; Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province),"This research was financially supported by the Humanity and Social Science Research and Planning Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 14YJA910004), National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 16BTJ019), Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. BK20151481).",,5,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-357-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,21.0,,,,,,94,99,,,,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6JA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426729800017,0
