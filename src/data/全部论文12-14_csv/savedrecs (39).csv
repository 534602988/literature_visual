We use a monthly index of banking system fragility, which captures almost every source of risk in the banking system, to estimate the effect of regulatory measures (entry restriction, reserve requirement, deposit insurance, and capital adequacy requirement) on banking stability in the context of a Markov-switching model. Our methodology is less prone to selection and simultaneity bias which are common in this type of study. We apply this method to the Indonesian banking system, which has been subject to several regulatory changes over the last couple of decades, and at the same time, has experienced a severe systemic crisis. We draw the following findings from this research: (i) entry restriction reduces crisis duration as well as the probability of such an occurrence; (ii) larger reserve requirements reduce crisis duration, but increase banking instability; (iii) deposit insurance increases banking system stability and reduces crisis duration; (vi) capital adequacy requirement improves stability and reduces the expected duration of banking crises. Finally, we find that previous studies present a negative simultaneity bias for deposit insurance and a negative selection bias for capital adequacy requirement We can infer from these findings that any relevant assessment of the impact of a regulation, which has been introduced during the recent period of banking instability, should account for simultaneity.

The theoretical grounding of the paper is done by discussing board composition and board compensation related studies, mainly belonging to the corporate governance literature. The main objective of the paper is to contribute to the debate on whether certain board characteristics can be documented to represent best practices. In doing so, we investigate if such board characteristics significantly influence companies' financial performance. We use econometric regression models in order to assess the impact of a series of corporate governance board related characteristics on the performance of companies (constituents of FTSE100) listed on the largest European capital market (London Stock Exchange), for the 2010-2011 period. An accounting measure of operating performance, namely the operating return on assets (ROA), is used. The profoundness of a potential impact of corporate board characteristics on companies' performance is investigated by considering both contemporaneous and subsequent operating performance. Results document best practices through the existence of several significant associations between considered board characteristics and firm performance.","[Mueller, Victor-Octavian; Ienciu, Ionel-Alin; Bonaci, Carmen Giorgiana; Filip, Crina Ioana] Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Bonaci, CG (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",carmen.bonaci@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Müller, Victor-Octavian/AFG-6428-2022; Bonaci, Carmen Giorgiana/IQS-0099-2023",,,,,,34,8,9,0,20,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2014,16.0,36,,,,,672,683,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AT0DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344607400016,0

It differentiates between demand side and supply side reactions as well as between intra- and inter-temporal shifts in greenhouse gas emissions. In our model, we integrate a stock-dependent marginal physical cost of extracting fossil fuels into Eichner and Pethig's (Int Econ Rev 52(3):767-805, 2011) general equilibrium carbon leakage model. The results are as follows: Under similar but somewhat tighter conditions than those derived by Eichner and Pethig (Int Econ Rev 52(3):767-805, 2011), a weak green paradox arises. Furthermore, a strong green paradox can arise in our model under supplementary constraints. That means a green policy measure might not only lead to a harmful acceleration of fossil fuel extraction but to an increase in the cumulative climate damages at the same time. In some of these cases there is even a cumulative extraction expansion, which we consider disastrous.","[Ritter, Hendrik] Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Schopf, Mark] Univ Paderborn, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; University of Paderborn,"Schopf, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Fac Business Adm & Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",hendrik.ritter@ovgu.de; mark.schopf@wiwi.upb.de,,,,,,,17,38,39,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This article analyzes the contested development of Jatropha biofuel sector in Tanzania by anchoring two new concepts of organizational models and institutional arrangements to the sectoral systems of innovation perspective. The notion of organizational models brings into relief the heterogeneity of actors in an innovation system and the ways in which the actors form networks, within and across national borders, to organize innovative activities. The concept of institutional arrangements refers to the ensemble of formal and informal institutions assembled during Tanzania's colonial and postcolonial eras, which directly govern innovative activities in specific organizational models. Based on a location-specific and historically grounded institutional analysis within the innovation system framework, implications are drawn for the future development of Tanzania's Jatropha sector including its links with European markets and for the regulation of next-generation biofuels.","[Arora, Saurabh; Romijn, Henny A.] Eindhoven Univ Technol TUE, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Caniels, Marjolein C.

We use data on microenterprises and crime incidence from victimization surveys. We find that higher rates of property crime are associated with a significantly lower probability an enterprise plans to expand or experiences income growth in the subsequent 12 months.

This article aims to explain this empirical fact by considering a growth model that incorporates a two-way relationship between corruption and government spending. That is, government spending gives rise to corruption and rent seeking, which feeds back by distorting the structure and size of government spending. In addition, the cost of corruption depends on the wage rate. Therefore, in low-income economies, increases in government spending tend to generate larger social losses caused by a higher level of rent dissipation and a concomitant rise in corruption and government inefficiency. Consequently, in such economies, an increase in government spending is more likely to result in a decline of economic growth.

The two-stage conditional maximum likelihood estimation technique is employed to take care of endogeneity between schooling and collection intensity decisions. The results revealed that a 50 per cent increase in collection intensity reduces the likelihood of child schooling by approximately 11 per cent.

The literature differentiates between structural models that are based on modeling of the evolution of the balance sheet of the issuer, and reduced-form models that specify credit risk exogenously by a hazard rate process. Until now, there has been no common agreement in academia and practice on which model framework better captures credit risk. As major difference we focus on the discriminative modeling of the default time. In contrast to the previous literature, we calibrate both approaches to the same data set, apply comparable estimation techniques, and assess the out-of-sample prediction quality on the same time series of credit default swap prices. As our empirical implementations of both approaches rely on the same market information we are able to judge whether empirically the model structure itself makes an important difference. Interestingly, our study shows that the models' prediction power are quite close on average indicating that for pricing purposes the modeling type does not greatly matter compared to the input data used. Still, the reduced-form approach outperforms the structural for investment-grade names and longer maturities. In contrast the structural approach performs better for shorter maturities and sub-investment grade names.","[Guenduez, Yalin] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Uhrig-Homburg, Marliese] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Finance Banking & Insurance, D-76049 Karlsruhe, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Gündüz, Y (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",yalin.gunduz@bundesbank.de; uhrig@kit.edu,"GUNDUZ, YALIN/JEF-5632-2023","Gunduz, Yalin/0000-0003-4173-3625; Uhrig-Homburg, Marliese/0000-0003-1671-2566",,,,,62,5,5,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Each signal incorporates both public and private information: the correlation of a signal's realizations across the economy determines its publicity. If information sources differ in their publicity then price-formation and expectations-formation processes separate, causing output gaps to open. An output-stabilizing central bank prefers averagely public information, and sometimes limits the clarity of its policy announcements to achieve this. The bank's incentive to engage privately in costly information acquisition and transmission is strongest not for the most influential signals, but instead for those which drive the largest wedge between prices and expectations: signals that are far from averagely public.

We argue that the heterogeneity of entrepreneurship influences how the level of entrepreneurial activity varies with age. Using a sample of 2,566 respondents from 27 European countries, we show that entrepreneurial activity increases almost linearly with age for individuals who prefer to only employ themselves (self-employers), whereas it increases up to a critical threshold age (late 40s) and decreases thereafter for those who aspire to hire workers (owner-managers). Age has a considerably smaller effect on entrepreneurial behaviour for those who do not prefer self-employment but are pushed into it by lack of alternative employment opportunities (reluctant entrepreneurs).

In this research, each of these factors had six elements. The results of the regression analysis are that Value for money in stores (beta=0.387, p=0.000) has the greatest impact on satisfaction when shopping quality performance is concerned, and that Retailer support for (national/local) cultural and sport events (beta=0.333, p<0.001) has the greatest impact on satisfaction in the case of CSR performance. Further analysis showed the difference in consumer perception of corporate social responsibility, depending on their occupation and level of education. It is also important to mention that consumers with environment and empathic concern have higher scores perception of CSR.

It first analyses whether the last cycle has been different compared to previous cycles in terms of length, amplitude, asymmetry and changes of these parameters during expansions and contractions. We also study the degree of economic and financial cycle synchronization between OECD countries but also of economic and financial variables within a given country and gauge the extent to which cycle synchronization changed over time. We next describe the connection between the great moderation and the last cycle. Finally, the study discusses the synchronization between the real economy and the financial sector and provides some new evidence on the banking sector's pro-cyclicality by using aggregate and bank level. The main findings show that the amplitude of the real business cycle was becoming smaller during the great moderation, but asset price cycles were becoming more volatile. In part, this was linked to developments in the banking sector which tended to accentuate pro-cyclical behaviour. Greater synchronization of cycles may help explain the severity of the crisis.","[Egert, Balazs] Univ Paris X Nanterre, Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,,,,,,,,,58,11,12,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Since most developing countries tilt their spending toward higher education, our analysis suggests that efforts that concentrate only on expanding mass education, such as the UN's Millennium Campaign, could end up raising inequality in much of the developing world.

This allows to analyze counterfactual scenarios that assess the impact of changes in exogenous variables on the intra-distribution dynamics of the firm size distribution. We find that a counterfactual decrease in average firm age increases the exit hazard of young firms, and at the same time reduces the probability of observing high-growth firms. An increase in the industry-wide entry rate and an increase in market growth, by contrast, have virtually no impact on the intra-distribution dynamics of the firm size distribution.

Promotion of the management and utilization of non-timber resources, as well as reforms aiming to increase the efficiency of forest protection and management, reduced timber harvests and increased investment, which in turn led to improvements of forest resources, although the effects were small.

This paper contributes to the process by exploring the economics of equity and mez zanine tranche retention in the context of systemic risk, moral hazard, accounting frictions and funding distortions. It shows that loan screening activity is maximized when the loan originating bank retains the equity tranche. However, in case capital structure irrelevance does not hold a profit maximizing bank is likely to favor retention of the less risky mezzanine tranche. From a regulator's perspective this is a problem because the implied loan screening activity is substantially lower in this case. Policy attention is even more warranted if performing due diligence is costly, the economic outlook is positive or loan profitability is high. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is some evidence that, as these banks improve their efficiency, state-owned banks are the least efficient banks while joint-venture and foreign-owned banks are the most efficient.","[Riyanto, Yohanes E.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Parinduri, Rasyad A.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia",Nanyang Technological University; University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Riyanto, YE (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, 14 Nanyang Dr HSS 04-83, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",yeriyanto@ntu.edu.sg,"Parinduri, Rasyad A./E-9684-2011; Riyanto, Yohanes E./C-2939-2009","Parinduri, Rasyad A./0000-0001-7540-8906; Riyanto, Yohanes E./0000-0001-7343-4043",,,,,23,11,11,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Consequently, a one-factor conditional consumption-based asset pricing model can be rejected without making any arbitrary assumptions on the dynamics of the price of risk or the conditional moments. Empirical evidence is somewhat more consistent with a consumption-based model augmented with an aggregate wealth growth factor, which can be motivated by either recursive preferences or relative wealth concerns.

Its key distinguishing feature from other resource-rich economies consists in its strong economic welfare objective function, which in line with its exceptional oil wealth renders its population amongst the wealthiest nations in the world. However, the guardian state also illustrates some of the negative externalities associated with resource wealth, namely the policy dilemma of directing seemingly abundant financial resources into the economy. The state faces a high propensity for waste, and for the systemic dilution of market incentives, thereby rendering sustained and self-generating economic growth more difficult than in less resource-rich economies.","Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford OX2 6FA, England",University of Oxford,"El-Katiri, L (通讯作者)，Oxford Inst Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6FA, England.",laura.elkatiri@oxfordenergy.org,,,,,,,74,9,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

However, although discussion of these issues goes back at least to Keynes (1936), a substantial literature on the ways in which firms manage liquidity has developed only recently. We argue that many of the key issues in liquidity management can be understood through the lens of a framework in which firms face financial constraints and wish to ensure efficient investment in the future. We present such a model and use it to survey many of the empirical findings on liquidity management. In addition, we discuss agency-based theories of liquidity, the real effects of liquidity choices, and the impact of the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis on firms' liquidity management.","[Almeida, Heitor] Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Almeida, Heitor; Campello, Murillo; Weisbach, Michael S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Campello, Murillo] Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Cunha, Igor] Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Weisbach, Michael S.] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Dept Finance, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Weisbach, Michael S.] Stockholm Inst Financial Res, S-11360 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Almeida, H (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Business, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",halmeida@illinois.edu; campello@cornell.edu; igor.cunha@novasbe.pt; weisbach@fisher.osu.edu,"Campello, Murillo/E-9433-2016",,,,,,87,80,94,0,61,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4806-9,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

But, there is growing interest among these countries to initiate trade policies and improve quality of institutions as a way to promote trade and boost foreign direct investment. This article extends the gravity model of trade to include proxies for trade reform policy and institutional quality among the 15 countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for data spanning 1984-2006. Alternative methods of estimation based on ordinary least squares, Heckman two-step procedure, and Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood produce predictions that are consistent with the standard gravity model.

Human actions are the cause of the VI major event of extinction of species, which induces radical changes in the interactions between the different components of the ecosphere. Understanding the structure, the functioning and changing of ecosystems under the impact of human activities, allows the evaluation of the consequences and taking the appropriate measures that are imposed. Correct and accurate information on the status and the evolution trends of ecological systems are necessary for this. This information can be obtained by carrying out effective and quality programs that try to answer a series of questions such as: Why? What? Where? When? And How? To measure parameters that allows characterizing ecosystems. Various types of media use the concept of monitoring. Scientists and managers talk about monitoring ecosystems, some populations, air, water and soil quality or pollution. So what is monitoring? Why? And How? to monitor. The information for different user categories is quantified through the processing and analysis of empirical data. In the case of natural resources, monitoring involves repeated measurements and for an unlimited period of time of the resources or the parameters of interest. Monitoring is done for the following reasons: to detect trends, to investigate the impact of an event, and to determine the basic conditions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Marketers are aware of difficulty of product development and implementation of strategies focused on consumer satisfaction. In this respect, competition is very strong; therefore, there must be taken appropriate strategies and marketing tactics that will lead to achieving these objectives. Building customer relationship marketing is considered a very important goal that can turn into a genuine organizational competence. This article aims to show the role played by sales forces, on the one hand, and marketing events, on the other hand, building a solid relationship, in the long term, with the customers. As components of integrated marketing communication, both sales forces and marketing events should be developed and supported by effective strategies and marketing tactics able to determine the competitive position of the organization. To capitalize on the benefits of sales forces, their position ought to be known in relation to marketing activities within the organization. It is also a must that advantages created by using marketing events should be acquainted by managers. But some of the most visible benefits refer to direct contacts directly with consumers through sales forces and create special moments through marketing events. Based on the literature in marketing at presenting the advantages orientation, these two communication techniques for developing and maintaining customer loyalty constitute a strong case for developing directions of action focused on these concepts. For this purpose, the article proposes several management measures in the use of sales forces and marketing events to build customer relationships. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, we test the flexible price monetarist variant and the sticky price Keynesian variant of the monetary model. We conduct our analysis employing a sample of 14 advanced economies using annual data spanning the period 1880 - 2012. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical background of the paper relies on the monetary model to the exchange rate determination. We provide a thorough econometric analysis using a battery of unit root and cointegration testing techniques. We test the price-flexible monetarist version and the sticky-price version of the model using annual data from 1880 to 2012 for a group of industrialized countries. Findings - We provide strong evidence of the existence of a nonlinear relationship between exchange rates and fundamentals. Therefore, we model the time-varying nature of this relationship by allowing for Markov regime switches for the exchange rate regimes. Modeling exchange rates within this context can be motivated by the fact that the change in regime should be considered as a random event and not predictable. These results show that linearity is rejected in favor of an MS-VECM specification which forms statistically an adequate representation of the data. Two regimes are implied by the model; the one of the estimated regimes describes the monetary model whereas the other matches in most cases the constant coefficient model with wrong signs. Furthermore it is shown that depending on the nominal exchange rate regime in operation, the adjustment to the long run implied by the monetary model of the exchange rate determination came either from the exchange rate or from the monetary fundamentals. Moreover, based on a Regime Classification Measure, we showed that our chosen Markov-switching specification performed well in distinguishing between the two regimes for all cases. Finally, it is shown that fundamentals are not only significant within each regime but are also significant for the switches between the two regimes. Practical implications - The results are of interest to practitioners and policy makers since understanding the evolution and determination of exchange rates is of crucial importance. Furthermore, our results are linked to forecasting performance of exchange rate models.

This methodology was applied because it discloses a measurable way in assessing the system economic viability. The model is based on the definition of an objective function (i.e. maximization of the annual worth of the cogeneration system) with terms including all costs and revenues from its operation. These terms correspond to the quantification of the investment, operational and maintenance costs, revenues from selling electricity to the grid, avoided costs from using renewable energy sources and from not having a full separate system to produce the heat, and the avoided carbon dioxide emission costs. Concerning the thermal systems case, the cost-benefit analysis should include not only the internal financial evaluation, but also the evaluation of the external variables (i.e. social and environmental aspects arising from the use of cogeneration technology). Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to discuss the development of a thermaleconomic optimization model for a cogeneration system based on the cost-benefit approach. The system operates accordingly to the Stirling engine cycle able to deliver 1-5 kW of electricity and a larger heat load, i.e., to fulfil the main energy needs of a residential building. The relevance of heat crediting electrical feed-in-tariffs and interest rates in combined heat and power plants is also discussed along the paper. The present work allowed to conclude that the evaluation of the economic feasibility of the system may be processed in three main steps: (1) assessment of the technical data; (2) definition of the costing methodology; and (3) evaluation the economic indicators. The costing methodology permits the characterisation of the expenditures, so that the options are validated and compared in an equitable way. Furthermore, the economic indicators may, or may not, turn an investment in an appraisal choice. The levelized cost of electricity has become one of the most popular methodologies for comparing electricity production costs from different scenarios. Considering the weight of revenues from the electricity sold to the grid in the total economic balance, the developed thermal-economic model seems to be very sensitive to the electricity tariffs.","[Ferreira, Ana Cristina; Martins, Luis B.; Nunes, Manuel L.; Teixeira, Senhorinha F.] Univ Minho, Sch Engn, Dept Prod & Syst, Guimaraes, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Ferreira, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",acferreira@dps.uminho.pt,"Nunes, Manuel/AAH-6496-2020; Teixeira, Senhorinha F C F/I-7713-2015; Nunes, Manuel J.

We estimate the causal effects of this admissions guarantee on a sequence of connected decisions: students' application behavior, admission decisions by the university, students' enrollment choices conditional on admission; as well as the resulting college achievement. We identify these effects by comparing students just above and just below the top 10% rank cut off. We assume that other student characteristics and incentives are continuous at this cut off. We find that students react to incentives created by the admissions guarantee-for example, by reducing applications to competing private universities. The effects of the admissions guarantee depend on the university and the type of students it attracts. The 10% law is binding and alters the decisions of the admissions committees. We find little evidence that the law increases diversity or leads to meaningful mismatch for the marginal student admitted.

These regional disparities in the enlarged EU must be reduced and dealt with an effective cohesion policy, part of which is the development of cross-border cooperation. According to the European Outline Convention of Madrid (1980), trans-frontier cooperation means any agreed transaction intended to encourage and cultivate the relationships between neighbouring local authorities of two or more parties. Euroregions promote cross-border cooperation between border regions and social partners in areas such as culture, education, tourism and the economy. From a purely economic standpoint, the preservation of natural or invisible borders is an obstacle to economic development. Since invisible barriers (languages, cultural problems, etc.) are hard to eliminate, the need to turn the boundaries in contact zones is stressed. These areas should he bridges between states, channels for the mutual understanding of peoples, prosperity borders and cradles of development. Factors that promote cross-border cooperation is, among others, the tradition and experience in collaboration, adequate common mechanisms by local authorities, the availability of sufficient financial resources, etc. On the contrary, factors that impede this cooperation are legal restrictions, disputes about the responsibility of the various levels of government, the limited experience of local authorities in the implementation of development programs, etc. It is estimated that, regarding the economic situation of regions bordering to candidate countries and the potential consequences of EU enlargement on them, the border areas of Greece and especially continental border areas, are among the least favoured regions, since they are faced with the most difficult situation regarding income, labour market dynamics, infrastructure and human resources. The prefecture of Series, a border region, according to the predictions of General and Regional Framework for Physical Planning, is indented to become a regional growth pole of the transborder cooperation. In this paper, based on the results of empirical research in institutions of Series, we examine the collaboration of institutions of Serres with their respective Bulgarian ones. More particularly we explore areas of cooperation, opportunities and obstacles, results, and impacts on Series by the accession of Bulgaria to the EU. The majority of institutions consider Bulgaria's endorsement to the EU as a positive progress for Serres and the extended region. Half or more of the institutions began their collaboration after the Bulgarian accession, aiming mainly to economic-development benefits and the exchange of experience and expertise, in fields of environment, culture, education, employment, entrepreneurship, etc. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Despite more intense contagion effects according to global markets connectivity, the importance of country specificity in the assessment of sovereign risk, which is decisive in dimensioning the borrowing costs, has grown. In the case of Romania, a sharp deterioration of its fiscal framework strength has been observed during post-crisis period, the public debt-to-GDP ratio currently reaching around 40%, thus doubling as compared to 2008. The structural analysis of government debt portfolio highlighted the main drivers of excessive public indebtedness and the increase in refinancing (rollover) risk on short term, which is supposed to overlap with the exchange rate and interest rate risks on medium and long term. Several indicators of Romania's debt sustainability are already on the warning levels edge which requires appropriate policies focusing on economic growth recovery, fiscal consolidation ongoing, increasing capacity of generating budgetary revenues, public debt management improvement.

Theoretical grounds of the paper are contemporary didactical concepts of emancipatory learning, implying intellectual autonomy as outcome of didactic approach to learning in teaching, meaning that those who learn manage themselves during learning so that they gradually take responsibility for their own learning. Basic finding refers to the following: there is a small number of students with developed metacognitive abilities, expected levels of critical thinking and efficient learning strategies, implying poor reaches of higher education teaching in view of meta-components of intellectual autonomy, anticipated as components of European qualification framework. Furthermore, this implies that more attention in teaching is paid to self-organized and self-determined learning, so that the greatest change introduced by realization of learning autonomy and anticipated by European qualification framework is the change of didactic approach to learning in teaching, arising out of contemporary didactic concepts of emancipatory learning, according to which teaching and learning lead in the direction opposite to the one which existed before, meaning that those who learn manage themselves during learning so that they could gradually take responsibility for their own learning.","[Gojkov, Grozdanka] PreschTeacher Training Coll M Palov Vrsac, Belgrade, Serbia; [Stojanovic, Aleksandar; Gojkov-Rajic, Aleksandra] Univ Belgrade, Teacher Training Fac, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,,g_gojkov@open.telekom.rs; aleksandar.stojanovic@uf.bg.ac.rs; rajis@open.telekom.rs,"Aleksandar, Stojanovic/GNW-6318-2022",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,978-953-253-126-8,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2014,10.0,,,,,,657,669,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347262000049,0

Of 402 articles citing the EFW index, 198 used the index as an independent variable in an empirical study. Over two-thirds of these studies found economic freedom to correspond to a good outcome such as faster growth, better living standards, more happiness, etc. Less than 4% of the sample found economic freedom to be associated with a bad outcome such as increased income inequality. The balance of evidence is overwhelming that economic freedom corresponds with a wide variety of positive outcomes with almost no negative tradeoffs.

In order to achieve the objective, the authors have selected relevant research papers and state of the art documents. Since the Venice and its territory are prone to various hazards, multi-hazard scenarios have been taken into consideration. Hazard impacts are the following: earthquake, tsunami and meteotsunami, flooding/acqua alta, subsidence, coastal erosion, salt wedge intrusion, pollution. The paper classifies potential impacts and recognises possible combinations of hazards that may occur in case study territory. A multi-hazard scenarios analysis considers impacts which, either occurring at the same time or shortly following each other, are dependent from one another or because they are caused by the same triggering event or hazard, or merely threatening the same elements at risk (vulnerable or exposed elements) without chronological coincidence (EU, 2010). The research presented in the paper serves as a support for cross-border multi-hazard assessment in other North-Eastern Adriatic Sea areas. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present survey explores farmers' acceptance of sugar beet supply contracts. We find that the farmers' responses are not in line with forecasts that are based on critical prices derived from naive gross margin comparisons. Instead, farmers take into account that the contractual obligation to supply a certain amount of beets in combination with the volumetric production risk produces an asymmetry in revenues. They also consider risk and dynamic changes of the relative competitiveness of sugar beet and competing crop alternatives. We furthermore find that the past matters: a subsequent improvement of a contract offer that is made after an initial offer has been rejected by farmers finds lower acceptance than an initially better offer.","[Musshoff, Oliver; Fahlbusch, Markus] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Hirschauer, Norbert] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Musshoff, O (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Farm Management Grp, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",oliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe (FNR); ScienceCampus Halle,Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe (FNR); ScienceCampus Halle,The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees and the editors of the German Journal of Agricultural Economics for helpful comments and suggestions.

Findings suggest that collective action affects safety in that it provides members with technical assistance and monitoring for pest management at the farming level. They confirm the U-shape hypothesis of the effect of group size on safety performance which derives from the trade-off that exists between economies of scale and free-riding.

The communication climate of an organization may influence the atmosphere in the organization which either encourages or hinders horizontal, upward or downward communication among the employees. In organizations with defensive climates, employees have the tendency to abstain from communicating their needs, as they become very cautious in making statements, and may have low level of motivation. On the other hand, organizations with supportive environments encourage active participation, healthy exchange of information and constructive conflict resolution. Instilling collaborative communication climate in an organization however requires effective management of conflicts. This paper reports a study conducted in a high risk work environment of an oil and gas company, in which the personnel have to work with volatile chemicals and heavy machines. The communicative behaviors in such hazardous environments are not to be taken lightly as communication errors could lead to fatal incidences. The study thus investigates the impact of communication conflict strategies used by the personnel on the overall organizational communication climate in a high-risk workplace environment. A set of questionnaires were administered to employees at all levels in the organization working at the administrative office and at the gas plant. One hundred and twenty five employees responded to the questionnaire, which attributed to more than fifty percent of the total population. The findings discuss the impact of various communicative strategies used in conflict management on the organizational communication climate. The overall findings suggest that conflicts management is related to the roles the personnel play in the organization. In assuming the leadership role, the top management's approach to conflicts include confrontational and compromise, instead of non-confrontation and control, which have a degree of impact on the communication supportive climate.

Unlike previous episodes of major consolidation in our history, our economy cannot rely on a soft cushion in the form of favourable global economic situation, integration and launch of new capacities in the automotive industry, as it was in 2003-2005 and 2011. The main objective of this paper is to estimate the size of fiscal multipliers in Slovakia in order to quantify the impact of fiscal packages in 2011 and 2013. The results show that the expenditure oriented consolidation has higher costs in form of lost growth. However, in the medium to long term it is less painful. Effect of consolidation package on GDP growth in 2011 is estimated at -0.99 percentage points. In 2013, we estimate that the fiscal consolidation cuts the growth of 0.68 percentage points.","Minist Finance Slovak Republ, Financial Policy Inst, SK-81782 Bratislava, Slovakia",,"Pécsyová, M (通讯作者)，Minist Finance Slovak Republ, Financial Policy Inst, Stefanicova 5,POB 82, SK-81782 Bratislava, Slovakia.",mpecsyova@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

To prove the existence of this pay gap and measure for its decomposition, we used Mincer wage equations and Blinder-Oaxaca-based decomposition techniques. Using data from the IV/2012 Quarterly Survey of Average Earnings, an econometrical model intended for regression and decomposition analyses was set. The most important part of the model is the dummy variable representing pertinence to the public sector of the national economy. We found that this dummy was statistically significant throughout the wage distribution, and that the value of its coefficient was negative and rising. This means that public sector employees up from the lowest deciles can be discriminated against in their salaries, and that this potential for discrimination increases as we look at the higher deciles. This finding was further examined by decomposition analysis which showed that on average, public sector employees are better equipped (have better characteristics) but have worse return on them (lower regression coefficients).","Univ Econ, Dept Publ Finance, CZ-13000 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Picka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Publ Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13000 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",jakub.picka@centrum.cz,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Through the case study, we analyse how CoPs increase personnel capabilities to improve company performance and achieve strategic goals. In this study, we use qualitative methods to answer the research question 'How are communities of practice used as a strategic tool in the case company?' The literature related to CoPs for strategic advantage is reviewed. Then, in the empirical portion, participant observations, document analysis and semi-structured interviews with experts from the case company are carried out. Based on the literature review and empirical findings, the model for virtual collaboration is constructed. The model provides practical guidelines for effective competence creation. Five organisational development areas are identified: (1) the strategy of a firm, (2) motivation to work in CoPs according to the strategy, (3) knowledge creation and sharing through CoPs, (4) feedback and benefits and (5) strategy improvements and best practices (business processes) for CoPs. Findings indicate that the case company should work on all five development areas simultaneously. We conclude that top management should encourage personnel to improve personal skills and support an open learning atmosphere. Our main suggestion for improving virtual collaboration on an organisational level at the case company is the establishment of informal networks. The relationship between CoPs and their stakeholders should be strengthened because, in the absence of these relations, the collaboration will never begin. In particular, the case company should improve its social networks and encourage personnel to join CoPs. This study paves the way for further research into experiments on the practical implementation of CoPs.","[Pohjola, Ilpo] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Business, Joensuu, Finland; [Iskanius, Paivi] Univ Oulu, Dept Mech Engn, Oulu, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; University of Oulu,"Pohjola, I (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Business, Joensuu, Finland.",ilpo.pohjola@carelian.fi; paivi.iskanius@oulu.fi,,,,,,,23,0,1,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,145,152,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000018,0

The journey of transformation was extremely challenging as the owners had to embrace concepts that were foreign to them. Quantum leaps in practice will challenge the mind-set of any small farmer immersed in an undeveloped agricultural world. The most difficult concept to rise above was the myth that labor is cheap.

Taking into account the technical criteria, scenarios with high coal power share are favoured. However, under a pure social approach, the best scenario would be a 100% RES electricity system.

It is evident that current maintenance working circumstances are more complex and therefore need to be managed by multiple and interlinked activities. Hence, an integrated high-level maintenance system which contains multiple sub-systems requires the collaboration of many stakeholders such as departments or units to improve resources, information sharing and maintenance practices.

According to specialists' calculations, an optimal utilization of the ecological resources of agricultural land in Romania would make it possible to cover the agri-food consumption needs for more than 38.5 million people, yet our country's agri-food trade balance has been deficient after 1989. The present paper attempts to make an inter-census analysis of one of the main factors responsible for the current poor performance and competitiveness of the Romanian agri-food sector: the utilization modality of the main resource in agriculture land. The bipolarity in land operation remains the defining reality for Romania's agriculture, with significant consequences on the production structure and performance in land operation. Thus, 30% of UAA is operated by the small-sized farms (under 5 ha), whose agricultural production mainly goes to self-consumption and only a very small amount is sold on the market. The productivity on these holdings is low, with a precarious technical endowment and a deficient investment capacity. Only half of Romania's UAA is operated by commercial farms, which are better capitalized. The specialization of the large-sized farms in field crops can transform Romania into a cereal exporter, yet it generates a deficit in the self-sufficiency of the domestic market in certain agri-food products for which Romania has adequate agro-pedo-climatic conditions.

This is one of ASEAN's strategies to accomplish to be ASEAN Economic Community in 2015. This paper presents a preliminary result from the first phase of a research project that explores the emergence of domestic and foreign investment in the Northern border zone of Thailand. It focuses on case studies conducted in Chiang Khong border area of Chiang Rai province in Thailand, and examines the design of investment promotion policies in this potential border zone. Using in-depth semi-structured interview method, the preliminary findings reveal that borderization is as a starting point to open up border and cross-border economic activities, whereas border city identity, the influence of emerging border city and the role of mutually inclusive growth between border cities are as a driver to bring them together. Hence, economic and investment promotion policies should be initiated from the onset of the context of border zone in order to trigger the actual border circumstances.

For example, many scholars promote improved governance as a means to slow resource use, whereas others have found that better governance increases extractive resource activities. In this paper we use within-country variation in Russia to test the impact of governance on timber harvesting. Using a reduced form fixed-effects model and satellite-based estimates of forest cover we find a statistically significant and non-linear effect of governance on the area of timber harvested: for a marginal improvement in governance timber harvesting increases, but this effect decreases at high levels of governance. These results are robust to alternative specifications and when instrumenting for economic growth. Governance could impact timber harvesting in Russia through ownership risk (i.e., tenure security), through the costs of doing business (i.e., bribes), or both. Nonparametric regressions and qualitative evidence suggest that both factors are at play in Russia. This analysis provides additional evidence that improving governance may increase natural resource extraction. This has important implications for policy prescriptions that suggest good governance will slow resource use in developing and transitional economies.","[Wendland, Kelly J.] Univ Idaho, Dept Conservat Social Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Lewis, David J.] Univ Puget Sound, Dept Econ, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA; [Alix-Garcia, Jennifer] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Wendland, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Conservat Social Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",kwendland@uidaho.edu,"Lewis, David/AAH-4137-2022; Lewis, David/AFQ-9010-2022; Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/W-1762-2019","Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Lewis, David/0000-0002-2161-4189; Alix-Garcia, Jennifer/0000-0003-0200-0496",,,,,65,19,19,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Very interestingly, it is observed that advanced countries tend to have either treasury bills or central bank bills while less advanced countries use both bills. Also the advanced countries are discovered to use more treasury bills than central bank bills. It is also found that employment of two securities leads to bond market segmentation, profit deterioration of central bank, and increase of government debt. Based on these problems caused by using two bills simultaneously, I suggest that central bank bills should be integrated into treasury bills in those countries in which two bills are used at the same time. As for the integration, I recommend that maturity of two bills need to be adjusted before long, resulting in short- and long-term for treasury securities and mid-term for central bank bills.

External factors consist of determinants regarding the company's environment while the internal ones are determined by the company's specific factors. The objective of this paper is to present an application of the entry modes of the selected Czech entrepreneurial subjects. The companies included in the study are those that have undertaken internationalization activities and are incorporated in the Czech Republic. There were a total of 297 enterprises that participated in the research. The research method was an oral questioning and the main instrument was a questionnaire. A relatively low degree of Czech companies' - that have undergone internationalization has resulted in the dominance of the least advanced forms of internationalization expansion, mainly exports with a small share of more advanced forms of foreign direct investments and a very low level of forms of international cooperation. Czech companies are in decision about the choosing the foreign entry mode influenced by the many factors. The greatest influence on the choice of foreign entry mode has entry mode variables. Entry mode variables constitute variables assessment characteristics of particular entry mode. Among the characteristics can be included flexibility of the method, risk of the method and degree of the method control.","Moravian Univ Coll Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic",,"Zapletalová, S (通讯作者)，Moravian Univ Coll Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",szapletalova@hotmail.com,,"Zapletalova, Sarka/0000-0003-0589-3867",,,,,13,0,0,2,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-3-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,276,286,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4DB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360509300027,0

This study estimates the effectiveness of risk communication frames and insurance policy conditions in increasing demand for flood insurance. It is examined how communication interacts with individual frames about the flood hazard that are rooted in regulatory focus theory. A choice experiment elicits willingness-to-pay (WTP) for annual and multi-year flood insurance, using of a survey of a representative sample of 1250 households. The statistical method is a mixed logit model that accounts for heteroskedasticity arising from stated choice certainty. The communication frames considerably increase WTP compared with a control group. This effect of communication is positively related to an individual's degree of prevention motivation. Moreover, we find that demand for flood insurance can be increased by introducing multi-year policies, as long as the contract duration is not too long. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There is a tendency for beta risk to rise markedly immediately following such announcements and remains relatively high even two years afterwards. This corroborates the view that the newly consolidated big banks resulting from mergers entail higher systematic risk and, instead of providing risk diversification to shareholders, exhibit greater comovement with the market. The broad asset pricing implication here is that the 'too big to fail' mentality that arises from large bank mergers actually translates into more risk for shareholders and susceptibility to adverse movements in the aggregate market.

We introduce the risk of default involved in extending intraday credit to determine the implications on consumer and bank behaviour. The results show that the non-marketable collateral assets model, which provides greater flexibility to banks but does not completely eliminate credit risk, is superior to other models. To minimize the remaining credit risk, financial authorities should analyse the financial condition of banks, establish higher credit standards for collateral and specify particular criteria to accept non-marketable assets.

Banks use equity capital and deposits from agents to finance investments of the productive sector. The sources of financial frictions are default rate and liquidity shock, due to deposits withdrawn in advance. The banking supervisor injects liquidity in the deposit market. Using data for the Brazilian economy in the period from 1995 to 2009, the structural parameters are estimated by Bayesian methods. Impulse response functions are computed to describe the dynamic effects of exogenous shocks. The major results show that credit risk is pro-cyclical and default risk depends on structural features. The banking regulator is able to set up a policy to promote financial stability and efficiently reduce fluctuations in the output. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates the dividend smoothing behavior in Korea where the tax regime and institutional settings of the financial market are different from those of developed countries. The empirical evidence shows that the dividend smoothing decision is influenced not only by a firm's characteristics, but also by macroeconomic factors such as tax and interest rates. Detailed results are as follows. First, application of the Lintner model shows that the extent of dividend smoothing in Korean firms is found to be less than that in the U.S. firms. Second, size, risk, growth and large shareholder ownership are found to be important determinants of dividend smoothing. Larger firms and lower growth firms smooth dividends more. Riskier firms tend to smooth more during the sample period while safer firms smooth dividends more for the post-liberalization period. These results are not consistent with the predictions of information asymmetry models. In addition, contrary to the agency theory based explanations of dividend smoothing, firms with concentrated ownership smooth dividend more. Finally, as for the effect of macroeconomic factors on dividend smoothing, both tax and interest rates are found to have significantly positive relationships with the degree of dividend smoothing. These findings suggest that institutional factors of financial market can play a critical role in understanding the dividend behavior in emerging markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines trips and their CO2 emissions to and from a shopping center from a time-space perspective, and it further considers how this information can be used in relocation planning. It is a case study in the Borlange city in mid-Sweden where trips to the city's largest shopping mall are scrutinized. We use GPS tracking data of car trips starting and ending at the shopping center. Firstly, we analyze the traffic emission patterns from a time-space perspective where the temporal patterns reveal hourly-based traffic emission dynamics. The spatial analysis uncovers a heterogeneous distribution of traffic emissions in spatial areas and individual street segments. Secondly, we find the observed trips mostly agree with an optimal route in terms of CO2 emissions. Drawing on this finding, we thirdly evaluate the location of the current shopping center by comparing it to two competing locations. We conclude that the two competing locations, being in the vicinity of the current one, would induce an insignificant improvement in terms of CO2 emissions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Stricter regulation may be good for bank stability, but not for bank efficiency. This research aims to examine whether banks have met the CBRC's standard of financial regulations and explores how the previously implemented financial regulations have affected bank efficiency and risk in the past. In addition, we also explored the trade-off relationship between efficiency and risk. Unlike other studies, this study used bank assets as a classification standard from the financial risk and differential regulatory perspective. The empirical results indicate that the CBRC regulates the provision coverage ratio and cost-to-income ratio, which seems relevant to large banks and the loan-to-deposit ratio, capital adequacy ratio, and leverage ratio, which seems relevant to small banks. The CBRC regulates the current ratio to reduce the risks of banks. Based on our empirical results, the current ratio did not affect the risks and led to different efficiency results between large and small banks. In an environment with asymmetric information, a bank decision-making is unobservable. The characteristics of financial regulation provide market clues if a bank is operating at the most efficiency and risk condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the value of individual failure experience depends on the level of group success experience. Specifically, group contemporary success experience and group congenital success experience will enhance the learning value of individual failure experience. Each type of higher level of group success experience provides useful experience pools (library effect), offers contrasts that are crucial for causal inferences (contrast effect), and motivates the focal individuals and the group to learn (motivation effect), albeit through distinct microprocesses. We test our theory with an event history analysis of the first licensing agreements for 778 lead patents granted to a major university technology transfer organization between 1971 and 1999, and find support for our theory.

Basis risk refers to the risk of non-payment of the index-linked instrument, given that the hedger's loss exceeds some critical level. The quantification of such risk measures from empirical data can be done in various ways and requires special consideration of the dependence structure between the index and the company's losses as well as the estimation of the tails of a distribution. In this context, previous literature shows that extreme value theory can be superior to traditional methods with respect to estimating quantile risk measures such as the value at risk. Thus, the aim of this paper is to conduct an empirical analysis of basis risk using multivariate extreme value theory and extreme value copulas to estimate the underlying risk processes and their dependence structure in order to obtain a more adequate picture of basis risk associated with index-linked hedging strategies. Our results emphasize that the application of extreme value theory leads to better fits of the tails of the marginal distributions in the considered stock price sample and that traditional methods in regard to estimating marginal distributions tend to overestimate basis risk, while basis risk can in contrast be higher when taking into account extreme value copulas.

However, credit accessibility could also have wider impacts on poverty if it leads to new hires outside the household. This paper contributes to the existing literature on microcredit in two important ways. First, it investigates the routes through which microcredit reaches those in poverty outside the household. We test whether by lending to the vulnerable non-poor microcredit can indirectly benefit poor laborers through increased employment. Second, we conduct the study in the context of urban poverty Mexico. This is relevant when considering that labor often represents the only source of livelihoods to the extreme urban poor. Our findings point to significant trickle-down effects of microcredit that benefit poor laborers; however, these effects are only observed after loan-supported enterprising households achieve earnings well above the poverty line.","World Inst Dev Econ Res UNU WIDER, Helsinki 00160, Finland",,"Niño-Zarazúa, M (通讯作者)，World Inst Dev Econ Res UNU WIDER, Katajanokanlaituri 6B, Helsinki 00160, Finland.",Miguel@wider.unu.edu,"Niño-Zarazúa, Miguel/C-2357-2014","Niño-Zarazúa, Miguel/0000-0003-4713-3890",,,,,25,4,7,2,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The models explain financial stress using both public and proprietary supervisory data from systemically important institutions, regressing institutional imbalances using an optimal lag method. The Systemic Assessment of Financial Environment (SAFE) EWS monitors microprudential information from the largest bank holding companies to anticipate the buildup of macroeconomic stresses in the financial markets. To mitigate inherent uncertainty, SAFE develops a set of medium-term forecasting specifications that gives policymakers enough time to take ex-ante policy action and a set of short-term forecasting specifications for verification and adjustment of supervisory actions. This paper highlights the application of these models to stress testing and policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that between 1975 and 2006 the average exit rate has risen considerably. In order to test various liabilities of establishment survival identified in the literature, we analyzed the impact of establishment size and put a special focus on differences between young and mature establishments. Our empirical analysis shows that the mortality risk falls with establishment size, which confirms the liability of smallness. The probability of exit is substantially higher for young establishments which are not more than 5 years old, thus confirming the liability of newness. There also exists a liability of aging since exit rates first decline over time, reaching a minimum at ages 15-18, and then rise again somewhat. The determinants of exit differ substantially between young and mature establishments, suggesting that young establishments are more vulnerable in a number of ways.","[Fackler, Daniel] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Schnabel, Claus] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, LASER, Nurnberg, Germany; [Schnabel, Claus; Wagner, Joachim] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",daniel.fackler@wiso.uni-erlangen.de; claus.schnabel@wiso.uni-erlangen.de; wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Schnabel, Claus/K-9668-2019; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536; Schnabel, Claus/0000-0001-5979-8879;",,,,,84,65,71,3,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that higher levels of D&O insurance coverage are associated with higher loan spreads and that this relation depends on loan characteristics in economically sensible ways and is attenuated by monitoring mechanisms. This association between loan spreads and D&O insurance coverage is robust to controlling for endogeneity (because both could be related to firm risk). Our evidence suggests that lenders view D&O insurance coverage as increasing credit risk (potentially via moral hazard or information asymmetry). Further analyses show that higher levels of D&O insurance coverage are associated with greater risk taking and higher probabilities of financial restatement due to aggressive financial reporting. While greater use of D&O insurance increases the cost of debt, we find some evidence that D&O insurance coverage appears to improve the value of large increases in capital expenditure for firms with better internal and external governance.

We measure firms' exposures to government interventions with an intervention score that is based on combined information on the firms' structure of bank relationships and their banks' participation in government capital support programs. We find that government capital infusions in banks have a significantly positive impact on borrowing firms' stock returns.

We find that in our current fragile market, advice by influential mavens for underwater homeowners to exercise their put option could result in a flood of strategic defaults causing a contagious downward spiral of residential real estate prices. Asymmetrically, when mavens recommend that homeowners not default, their ability to save a failing market is far more limited.","[Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Collins, Andrew J.] Old Dominion Univ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Fefferman, Nina H.] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",William & Mary; Old Dominion University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",michael.seiler@mason.wm.edu; ajcollin@odu.edu; fefferman@aesop.rutgers.edu,"Fefferman, Nina/AAQ-7378-2021","Fefferman, Nina/0000-0003-0233-1404; Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-8012-2272; Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,70,20,22,0,22,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

In addition, information intermediaries publicly analyze, discuss, and disseminate these disclosures. Thus, greater public firm presence in an industry should reduce uncertainty in that industry. Following the theoretical prediction of investment under uncertainty, we hypothesize and find that private firms are more responsive to their investment opportunities when they operate in industries with greater public firm presence. Further, we find that the effect of public firm presence is greater in industries with better information quality and in industries characterized by a greater degree of investment irreversibility. Our results suggest that public firms generate positive externalities by reducing industry uncertainty and facilitating more efficient private firm investment. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We have imprecise knowledge about the probability distribution of mortality rates in the future. Mortality risk, therefore, can be defined in a broader term of ambiguity. In this article, we investigate the effects of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion on prices of mortality-linked securities. Ambiguity may arise from parameter uncertainty due to a finite sample of data and inaccurate old-age mortality rates. We compare the price of a mortality bond in three scenarios: (1) no parameter uncertainty, (2) parameter uncertainty with Bayesian updates, and (3) parameter uncertainty with the smooth ambiguity preference. We use the indifference pricing approach to derive the minimum ask price and the maximum bid price, and adopt the economic pricing method to compute the equilibrium price that clears the market. We reveal the connection between the indifference pricing approach and the economic pricing approach and find that ambiguity aversion has a much smaller effect on prices of mortality-linked securities than risk aversion in our example.","[Chen, Hua; Sun, Tao] Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Sherris, Michael] Univ New S Wales, CEPAR, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Sherris, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Zhu, Wenge] Shanghai Univ Econ & Finance, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, H (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",hchen@temple.edu; m.sherris@unsw.edu.au; tuc69277@temple.edu; wengezhu@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"; Sherris, Michael/E-6235-2010","SUN, Tao/0000-0002-2035-2260; Sherris, Michael/0000-0002-8077-3649",,,,,44,18,18,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

We develop a structural repeated game to represent buyer-seller relations in a developing country grain market, motivated by observations in Ethiopia. The model generates hypotheses regarding the logic that drives long-term tied transactions, as governed by information access, screening and investment costs, and time preferences. The model's predictions are tested using market transaction data collected in Ethiopia in 2009. Results support the view that a relational contract is driven by access to information and the costs of screening.

Multiple indicators can often be used to communicate similar ecological outcomes. Previous studies using alternative indicators in stated preference surveys suggest that welfare estimates may be indicator-dependent, casting doubt on whether welfare estimates are sufficiently reliable for cost benefit analysis. We suggest that the reason for such indicator dependence may be that indicators used in these prior studies represented different outcomes valued by respondents. This possibility underscores the need for greater attention to selection of indicators and their properties within stated preference survey design. This paper develops a model introducing the concept of outcome equivalent indicators, defined as indicators that provide alternative representations of identical underlying outcomes. To assess empirically whether welfare estimates are indeed robust to indicator choice when alternative indicators are expected to be outcome equivalent, we analyze data from a choice experiment estimating willingness to pay for migratory fish restoration in Rhode Island, USA. Results demonstrate that welfare estimates are robust to the use of alternative ecological indicators within stated preference scenarios.","[Zhao, Minjuan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, Dept Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Johnston, Robert J.] Clark Univ, George Perkins Marsh Inst, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Schultz, Eric T.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Northwest A&F University - China; Clark University; Clark University; University of Connecticut,"Johnston, RJ (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Dept Econ, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",minjuan.zhao@nwsuaf.edu.cn; rjohnston@clarku.edu; eric.schultz@uconn.edu,,"Johnston, Robert/0000-0001-7523-2701; Schultz, Eric/0000-0003-4086-7883",,,,,55,30,36,0,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

These risk models are evaluated and compared based on the unconditional coverage, independence and conditional coverage criteria. The economic importance of the results is also highlighted by assessing the daily capital charges under the Basel Accord rule. The best approaches for estimating the VaR for the individual assets under study and for the three VaR-based optimal portfolios and efficient frontiers are discussed. The VaR-based performance measure ranks the most diversified optimal portfolio (Portfolio #2) as the most efficient and the pure precious metals (Portfolio #1) as the least efficient.

Evidence from the 2003 tax cut,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Capital structure; Personal taxes; Individual ownership,DEBT; ADJUSTMENT; INCENTIVES; DECISIONS; PRICES; COST; ACT,"Because the personal tax treatments of interest and dividend income likely affect the relative cost of debt and equity financing, a sharp change in tax treatment could affect firms' optimal leverage. This paper examines the effect of the 2003 equity income tax cut on firms' debt usage. Because this tax cut affected only individual investors, we can use a difference-in-differences method to identify the effect of personal tax on firms' leverage. Previous research has found that the 2003 tax cut encouraged dividend payouts and reduced the cost of equity, but it provides no link to equilibrium leverage ratios. We estimate that the tax cut causes the affected firms' leverage to decrease by about 5 percentage points. Furthermore, we show that the effects of the tax cut are stronger for firms with lower marginal corporate tax rates and for firms that are not financially constrained, consistent with our theoretical predictions. Overall, we find strong evidence that personal tax is an important determinant of firms' optimal leverage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This should apply to investments in independent enterprises and multi-national enterprises alike. This hypothesis is investigated by analyzing a panel of 407,000 European firms for the years 1985 to 2010. When income is set in relation to invested capital, risk measured by earnings volatility emerges as the most important stable determinant of income. Results indicate that both MNEs and independent firms regularly account for risk as a major determinant of income when pricing international goods and services. Hence international taxation rules for multi-national enterprises should account for risk premia in transfer prices and resulting profits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The shocks were identified as demand, supply, and financial shocks. The demand shock was the most prevalent of the shocks, while the financial shock was least frequent. The SMEs took a spectrum of measures against the demand shock by seeking help from suppliers and financial institutions. We find that the measures taken by the SMEs crucially depended on the bank-firm relationship as well as the customer-supplier relationship. The bank-dependent SMEs asked their closely-affiliated financial institutions for help, while the SMEs less dependent on financial institutions sought help primarily from their suppliers. A long customer-supplier relationship plays an important role in mitigating the supply shock.","[Ogawa, Kazuo] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Tanaka, Takanori] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Econ, Kyoto, Shiga, Japan",Osaka University; Ritsumeikan University,"Ogawa, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka 5670047, Japan.",ogawa@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285068, 22330068] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,23,23,28,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using a unique data set consisting of all bids in all auctions for the main refinancing operation conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and October 2008 we find that funding liquidity risk is typically stable and low, with occasional spikes especially around key events during the recent crisis.

Implicit in this study is the hypothesis that the African environment is unique enough to warrant its own host of strategies, which may be distinctive enough to form part of a new strategic template, or business model. Initially, a review of existing literature is undertaken to profile the African aviation environment and evaluate existing airline business models and their evolution, both globally and in Africa. The methodology consists firstly of a cluster exercise, whereby 57 African airlines are analysed in terms of their network and size, to yield a number of heterogeneous groups which serve to identify the current business models of airlines on the continent. Following this, eight airlines (representative of the groups outlined in the cluster analysis) were subsequently selected for analysis in terms of the Product and Organisational Architecture framework. While it was evident that the traditional models are followed in Africa, in some instances variations were apparent. Full-service network carriers and regional carriers were concluded as being the most prominent and stable in the African market. The applicability of the low-cost carrier model in Africa was also examined at length, with mixed results. The analysis also raised network density and connectivity as essential components of business models for delivering profits in an African context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

I argue that the impact of institutional constraints on country risk premia depends on the government's concern with the country's creditworthiness and its willingness to repay; two variables that are hardly observable. To properly evaluate the relationship between political institutions and sovereign borrowing, I focus on the link between institutional constraints and the risk premia of Argentine bonds between 1822 and 1913. Specifically, I analyze whether a structural break in the government's cost of borrowing time-series exists. I use the Perron-Volesang test for structural change with unknown break dates. The statistical analysis indicates that the adoption of institutional constraints led to significant improvements in borrowing terms: the series has a single structural change; and the distinctive break point is associated with the country's adoption of constitutional checks and balances. Time-series regressions and instrumental variables (IV) estimation reinforce these findings.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Saiegh, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ssaiegh@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,22,9,9,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2013,156.0,1-2,,,,,61,75,,10.1007/s11127-012-0003-4,0.0,,,15,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,164WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000320443600005,0

This study aims to understand the influence these social aspects have on travellers' decision making and behaviour. Furthermore, this research seeks to find out the possibility of utilising this understanding to enhance policies on behavioural change. Social interactions, which may due to an interdependent situation between travellers, social information about other travellers' behaviour and communication between travellers enable social learning and social influence processes between travellers. Social psychology theories have been used to provide the underlying framework for the study as well as the methods for analysing the data using the individual and social learning models. This study utilises a laboratory experiment to capture the role of social interactions and social learning in the dynamics of travellers' decision making over time. A major finding of the laboratory experiment is that social interaction and social learning influence individuals' behaviour. However providing more social information makes people behave in a less cooperative way and be more unstable in making choices. It also influences more people to make contrarian than direct responses. Analyses reveal that people learn individually from their previous experience and socially from other people. It is revealed that confirmation (keeping previous behaviour when observed individuals also chose the same choice) and conformity (following the choice of the majority) are exhibited whenever individuals have access to social information, and therefore could be incorporated into models of travel choice. These findings elicit some behavioural, policy and methodological insights. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By constructing a two-region model, we show that two distribution patterns - segregation and full agglomeration - may be supported as equilibrium outcomes. Their properties closely resemble those of the equilibrium patterns in the standard new economic geography models. In addition, it is shown that the third type of equilibrium pattern - incomplete agglomeration - may emerge when consumers pay different amounts of transport cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The study considers the degree to what a measurement model is useful for examining this boycott process. When the study examines the boycotting of foreign goods as an individual or social process, the study examines the phenomena of nationalism, xenophobia, country-of-origin, and ethnocentrism as antecedents. The conversion of the dimensions obtained from discourse analysis into items and that were tested by means of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis lead to two discoveries: 1) three basic dimensions - hate against foreign products, citizen consumers and economic independence - influenced decisions to boycott and 2) the second-order model (all constructs load on one construct as consumer boycotting) was more valid than the three first-order models.","[Altintas, Murat Hakan; Kilic, Serkan] Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Bursa, Turkey; [Kurtulmusoglu, Bahar F.] Baskent Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Kaufmann, Hans Ruediger] Univ Nicosia, Sch Business, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Harcar, Talha] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Uludag University; Baskent University; University of Nicosia; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Altintas, MH (通讯作者)，Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Bursa, Turkey.",mhakan@uludag.edu.tr,"kurtulmuşoğlu, feride/A-7058-2017; ALTINTAS, murat hakan/AAG-7359-2021","Altintas, Murat Hakan/0000-0001-8517-0540",,,,,107,6,6,3,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2013,15.0,34,,,,,485,504,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,156XV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000319858100014,0

While the occurrence of serious health shocks that required hospital treatment doubled the average debt burden of exposed households compared to the control group, households with nuclear family members (a parent, child, or spouse) in the US did not increase their debts due to health shocks. This finding is consistent with the view that remittances respond to households' demand for financing emergencies and make them less reliant on debt-financing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is important because in most of the literature these policies are indistinguishable. However, Freeman's argument that the central bank should absorb losses associated with default to provide risk sharing stands in stark contrast to the concern that central banks should limit their exposure to credit risk. We extend Freeman's model by introducing moral hazard. With moral hazard, the central bank should avoid absorbing losses and Freeman's argument breaks down. However, we show that policies resembling discount window lending and open-market operations can still be distinguished in this new framework. The optimal policy is for the central bank to make a restricted number of creditors compete for funds. By restricting the number of agents, the central bank can limit the moral hazard problem. By making them compete with each other, the central bank can exploit market information that reveals the state of the economy.","[Chapman, James T.

Since individuals are likely to differ in their attitudes to these salient outcomes, and in their entrepreneurial self-efficacy, we hypothesize that a different strength of intention for entrepreneurship versus intrapreneurship will be due to individual differences in self-efficacy and in their attitudes to the outcomes from entrepreneurial, as compared to intrapreneurial, behavior. We find that while self-efficacy is significantly related to both entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial intentions, attitudes to income, ownership, and autonomy relate only to entrepreneurial intentions, while attitude to risk relates only to intrapreneurial intentions.","[Douglas, Evan J.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Fitzsimmons, Jason R.] U21 Global, Singapore 068808, Singapore",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Douglas, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",edouglas@usc.edu.au; jfitzsimmons@u21global.edu.sg,,"Fitzsimmons, Jason/0000-0002-4389-5268",,,,,79,122,143,5,176,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

While much research has been conducted in terms of motorized modes, the promotion of healthy aging argues for new research to investigate the multi-modal travel behavior of seniors including active travel. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the use of two motorized and one active mode of transportation, and their corresponding trip length. A joint discrete-continuous modeling framework allows us to examine the tendency to travel by different modes using a multinomial structure, and trip length using a hazard formulation. Data are drawn from Montreal's Household Travel Survey of 2008. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes and urban form are used. The results of the analysis reveal a significant degree of geographical variability in the travel behavior of seniors in Montreal. In particular, estimates for seniors with different socio-economic and demographic profiles show substantial intra-urban variability in walking behavior, and the role of neighborhood design attributes in influencing the mobility of seniors.

We overall conclude that current studies are likely to be misstating skill because they ignore the managers' self-reported benchmark in the performance evaluation process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that hard-to-borrow stocks will have distinct return patterns, responding more to shocks in the supply of shares available, and to changes in the heterogeneity of investor beliefs, than other stocks. We conduct two empirical tests in which we find strong support for these equilibrium predictions. In our first test, we take advantage of a tax-driven exogenous shock to share loan supply and find that when supply is reduced around dividend record dates, prices of hard-to-borrow stocks increase 1.1% while prices of easy-to-borrow stocks are unaffected. In our second test, we find that hard-to-borrow stocks have 4.8% lower three-month returns than other stocks, with negative returns concentrated in stocks with high heterogeneity in investor beliefs. Thus, we extend the Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002) result that stocks with a greater dispersion of investor beliefs have lower returns. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One year after inclusion, their mean industry-adjusted cash holdings decline by nearly 32% from the year before inclusion. Several factors explain this decline. The precautionary motive for cash subsides due to these firms becoming more visible, less uncertain, and less constrained to raise cheap external capital. Corporate governance deteriorates after inclusion due to increased managerial entrenchment, which leads to a reduction in cash as suggested by the free cash flow hypothesis. Most index firms face diminishing investment opportunities and decreasing capital expenditures, which implies a lesser need for cash holdings related to the transaction motive. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is a daunting task to use standard numerical methods to solve a constrained portfolio choice problem, especially when there is a large number of state variables. By suitably embedding the constrained problem in an appropriate family of unconstrained ones, we provide some equivalent optimality conditions for the indirect value function and optimal portfolio weights. These results simplify and help to solve the constrained optimal portfolio choice problem in jump-diffusion models.

Through a three-step cluster analysis of 117 published articles on succession in family firms published between 1974 and 2010, we find several themes within which succession can be understood from an entrepreneurial process perspective where both the entry of new owners and exit of old owners are associated with the pursuit of new business opportunities. We identify gaps within each cluster and develop a set of research questions that may guide future research on succession as an entrepreneurial process. Since succession involves implications for individuals, families and firms, we suggest researchers should adopt a multilevel perspective as they seek answers to these research questions.

Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that individual institutions were reluctant to seek public assistance. However, when we correct standard errors for bank-and-time effects, virtually all announcement impacts vanish in Europe, whereas they weaken in the United States.

However, reinvestments could also be motivated by a status quo bias, which describes a behavioral tendency to pursue the status quo option disproportionately often. This paper investigates the role of the status quo bias for institutional investments in private equity funds. Based on our fieldwork and a unique data set of 136 institutional investors and private equity firms in Germany, we show that institutional investors strongly prefer private equity firms in which they have invested before. The magnitude of the status quo bias depends on the nature of the investment opportunity and certain investor characteristics. Our results suggest that reinvestments are a double-edged sword for institutional investors that can result from a rational investment strategy, but also from an irrational investment behavior.","[Freiburg, Markus] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany; [Grichnik, Dietmar] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management; University of St Gallen,"Freiburg, M (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Burgpl 2, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany.",markus.freiburg@whu.edu,,,,,,,109,8,8,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

First, we develop a stylized banking sector equilibrium model to develop some basic intuition of the effects of margining. We find that a margin requirement can be privately and socially sub-optimal. Subsequently, we extend this model into a dynamic simulation model that captures some of the essential characteristics of over-the-counter derivatives markets. Contrarily to the common belief that margining always reduces default risk, we find that there exist situations in which margining increases default risk, reduces aggregate derivatives' trading volume, and has an ambiguous effect on welfare in the banking sector. The negative effects of margining are exacerbated during periods of market stress when margin rates are high and collateral is scarce.

Then, we generated potential alternative routes using a modified labeling approach, measured the route environment through environment auditing and secondary data, estimated two multinomial probit models, and compared the results between the two neighborhoods and between the alternative choice models. It is found that route choice models based on revealed preferences could be a valid and complimentary method for assessing the pedestrian environment, and they could help to prioritize or justify investment related to pedestrian infrastructure. In contrast, contingent rating based on stated preference may overestimate the importance of more tangible attributes, such as distance and safety, because pedestrians were often unable to articulate intangible amenities, such as streetscapes and facade designs. However, route choice modeling seems to perform well only when the pedestrian system offers many route alternatives and pedestrians do have experience with multiple routes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the benchmark estimation, we find that the FH coefficients of ten Asian economies decrease significantly from 0.65 during the pre-crisis period to 0.32 during the post-crisis period. Furthermore, the coefficient for the post-crisis period is less statistically significant than that for the pre-crisis period. The extended model estimations with additional control variables controlling for the business cycle, different foreign exchange rate systems, and capital control also show the results which are consistent with the benchmark estimation results. Rolling regressions show a consistently declining trend of the FH coefficients in Asia during our sample period. These results provide consistent evidence, according to the FH proposition, of increasing international capital mobility in Asia during the post-1997 Asian financial crisis period.

A significant negative reaction of net loans to the debt ratio indeed characterizes the decisions of both multilateral and bilateral creditors.

While large institutional investors participate early in IPOs managed by high reputation underwriters, high net worth investors appear to do the same in IPOs managed by low reputation underwriters. The varying nature of relationships with investors also has important consequences for IPO pricing. Our analysis of the setting of the offer price shows that reputation matters greatly for high reputation underwriters.

Previous research has generally examined the relationship between this proliferation and market concentration-a correlate of competitive intensity in the center of the market. In this paper, we extend the theory by arguing that resource release also occurs as the degree of competitive overlap among producers in the center intensifies, even when concentration or other structural features do not vary; we expand its implications by demonstrating that increased competitive overlap in the market center can enhance the viability of producers positioned near the center more than those in the periphery; and we enrich and complete it by specifying the additional assumptions needed to extend the theory of resource partitioning to entry processes. Consistent with our expectations, an empirical examination of the Italian broadcast television industry, from 1992 to 2003, finds that the failure rates of both near-center and peripheral stations decline with greater competitive overlap in the programming of the national broadcasters, with the failure rates of the near-center stations falling more than those of peripheral stations. Greater competitive overlap similarly stimulates the entry of near-center stations more than peripheral ones.","[Reis, Samira] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Madrid, Spain; [Negro, Giacomo] Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sorenson, Olav] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Perretti, Fabrizio] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Lomi, Alessandro] Univ Lugano, Fac Econ, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Emory University; Yale University; Bocconi University; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Negro, G (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Goizueta Business Sch, 1300 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",samira.dias@uc3m.es; giacomo_negro@bus.emory.edu; olav.sorenson@yale.edu; fabrizio.perretti@unibocconi.it; alessandro.lomi@usi.ch,"dos Reis, Samira Dias/R-4119-2018; Sorenson, Olav/ABE-5373-2020; Lomi, Alessandro/AFR-0469-2022","dos Reis, Samira Dias/0000-0002-5910-5689; Sorenson, Olav/0000-0002-0599-6738; PERRETTI, FABRIZIO/0000-0002-9073-4774; lomi, alessandro/0000-0002-2858-0022",,,,,34,10,11,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Contrary to standard conventions, domestic households are allowed to invest in foreign housing and vice versa. Using Bayesian methods, the model is applied to data for Hong Kong. We identify strong and robust housing wealth effects, and show that property prices are mainly driven by intratemporal preference perturbations rather than by disturbances in financial frictions or price mark up shocks. These disturbances also explain a non-negligible part of the volatility of consumption, GDP and employment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The European Commission encourages them to do so by conditioning subsidies to the building of joint regional infrastructure. In the face of serious political and legal hurdles to Baltic gas security co-operation, Brussels' approach might be misguided if it prevents the implementation of workable national policy alternatives. Our calculations show that the Baltic States could insure their gas-fired district heating systems for small security premiums. Each country could insure its entire peak gas consumption against even long-lived disruptions for a premium of about 10% by building a national LNG terminal. A joint Baltic LNG terminal is indeed cheaper in most cases, but only marginally so.

Our parameterised version of the lemons' model of Akerlof in the insurance context predicts total crowding-out of low risks when insurers offer a single full insurance contract. The therapy proposed by Rothschild and Stiglitz consists of adding a partial insurance contract so as to obtain self-selection of risks. We test the theoretical predictions of these two models in two experiments. A clean test is obtained by matching the parameters of these experiments and by controlling for the risk neutrality of insurers and the common risk aversion of their clients by means of the binary lottery procedure. The results reveal a partial crowding-out of low risks in the first experiment. Crowding-out is not eliminated in the second experiment and it is not even significantly reduced. Finally, instead of the predicted separating equilibrium, we find pooling equilibria. The latter can be sustained because insureds who objectively differ in their risk level do not perceive themselves as being so much different.

Piece of accounting data is termed value relevant if it is significantly related to the dependent variable, which may be expressed by the stock price. The methods used for gauging information contents of various accounting numbers were Ordinary Least Squared (OLS), Random Effects Model (REM), and Fixed Effects Model (FEM). The findings show that there is a significant relationship between accounting information and share prices of companies listed on the NSE. Dividends are the most widely used accounting information for investment decisions in Nigeria, followed by earnings and net book value. The study therefore recommends that the firms should improve the quality of earnings as manipulated earnings (of which dividends are sub-sets) have large effects on share prices.

The Granger causality (G-causality) test is a method to detect linear causal relationships between time series. However, there exists significant evidence for nonlinear causality between financial time series. Hence, several nonlinear extensions of G-causality (NLG-causality) were proposed. Moreover, a new method called the coupling spectrum (CS) was recently proposed to find the nonlinear causal relationship between two time series. In many financial cases, the direction of causality is changing over time. In this work, we adapt the NLG-causality and CS methods by using a moving window technique to identify possible causality changes over time. We compare the performance of the adapted CS and NLG-causality methods on a simulated temporal nonlinear causal system and a real data set the stock prices of Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corporation. The simulated and empirical results show that the CS method is more robust than the NLG-causality method and that CS is capable of dealing with time-varying nonlinear causality between financial time series.","[Alizad-Rahvar, Amir Reza; Ardakani, Masoud] Univ Alberta, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada; [Cribben, Ivor] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Dept Finance & Stat Anal, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada; [Cribben, Ivor] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R6, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Alizad-Rahvar, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada.",ar.alizad@ualberta.ca; ardakani@ualberta.ca; cribben@ualberta.cabagoom,"Alizad-Rahvar, Amir Reza/AAR-7594-2021","Alizad-Rahvar, Amir Reza/0000-0001-8543-9925",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,11,21,,,,,,11,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100002,0

Governance which is associated with the concept of management and regulation is seen as a mechanism in strengthening the cooperatives. Governance structure has been used in the private and public sectors as key indicator of success; thus, it may be relevant to the cooperatives. An effective organisational control structure, which includes fraud control, will assist an entity to promote ethical and business practices, improve accountability and contribute to quality outcomes. This paper therefore aims to highlight the issues and challenges faced by cooperative organisations worldwide and aspire to suggest that cooperatives will need to embark on governance in order to be successful in the dynamic environment.

Bootstrapping is an approach to statistical inference adherent to computationally intensive statistical techniques. Since it does not require the classical distributional assumption, the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, often used to estimate the parameters of regression models in the bootstrap procedure, is extremely sensitive to outliers and non-normality of errors. The robust bootstrapping method replaces the classical bootstrap mean and standard deviation with robust estimates by using robust regression estimates with a high breakdown-point. Values of the indicator of tertiary education attainment in the European countries depend on many indicators of the general economic background, employment, etc. The values of these indicators vary between the European countries and, consequently, the occurrence of outliers can be dealt with in an analysis.

A positive R&D sensitivity to asset sale proceeds indicates binding financing constraints since cash inflows from tangible asset sales are negatively correlated with productivity shocks and not otherwise connected to intangible investment via non-financial channels. Using a variety of estimation approaches, we document a strong, positive link between cash inflows from fixed asset sales and corporate R&D investment, but only among firms most likely facing binding financing constraints. These results offer robust evidence that financing frictions impact the increasingly important yet understudied intangible corporate investments that drive innovative activity, and they highlight a previously unexplored but potentially valuable use of proceeds from fixed asset divestitures.

In South Africa, notwithstanding the strides that have been made to foster equitable land ownership, land reform policies have been unsuccessful in delivering land to the poor majority. Due to the nature of agriculture as a source of food production and national security, and the lack of farming skills and related competencies' equilibrium, programmes intended to deliver land to black people have been inadequate in their reach. Whereas policy has emphasised the urgency of solving equity issues in land ownership, equally challenging has been finding the right set of programmes to achieve this without triggering a perennial land ownership squabble. After 18 years of democracy, a need remains to find a balance between continuity in food production and equitable redistribution of land in South African agriculture. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to achieve equitable and fair redistribution of land without inhibiting agricultural production, through land sharing. We show that sharing land could help fast-track the development of a farming skills and related competencies' equilibrium between black and white farmers. The paper further demonstrates that the gains in land sharing far outweigh other programmes of land reform that have been used and suggested thus far.","[Dlamini, Thula S.; Verschoor, Aart-Jan] Agr Res Council, Econ Serv, Pretoria, South Africa; [Verschoor, Aart-Jan] Agr Res Council, Biometr Serv, Pretoria, South Africa; [Fraser, Gavin C.

However, thus clear defined (accurate) values are not known in real situations. There is always uncertainty about the time durations of activities. There is the PERT method which computes with uncertainties, but this method is demanding to studying and implementing. The uncertainties of the time durations of activities can be also described by fuzzy sets. This paper shows how fuzzy numbers are used to determine a critical path method in a fuzzy project network, where the duration time of each activity is expressed by a triangular fuzzy number. The described method is compared with Monte Carlo method. The comparison shows that the method described in this paper is simple to calculating a critical path than many methods (e.g. PERT) shown in literature.","[Doskocil, Radek; Doubravsky, Karel] Brno Univ Technol, Dept Informat, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,,doskocil@fbm.vutbr.cz; doubravsky@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Doskočil, Radek/GLN-8159-2022; Doubravský, Karel/GLR-2336-2022","Doskočil, Radek/0000-0002-9716-1411; Doubravský, Karel/0000-0002-6882-1046",,,,,20,3,3,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-1-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,1402,1411,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301500136,0

Model farms represent possibility of farming in different production areas of the Czech Republic (corn and beet, potato growing and potato and oat) with the support of the EU CAP both commodity-oriented (SAPS, Top-Up), and LFA. Model farms are standardized for an area of 100 hectares. Calculation of model farms economy is carried out using Model Farm 4, which calculates optimum economy of farms. The model is based on the production of economic data from model RENT 4, which calculates the profitability of agricultural commodities with and without subsidies during the period 1998-2017. RENT Model 4 is based on a sample survey of costs of selected farms that is annually conducted by UZEI. For plant and animal commodities calculation, producer prices were used for the CR (source: CSO). In order distinguish differences in the production area, producer prices were modified in accordance with the results of the sample survey. Information on future EU agricultural policy is based on the latest available information. Farming in different production areas of the Czech Republic in the case of economically normal conditions is profitable, when proper production focus and agricultural supports are used. This corresponds to the years 2011-2014. In the case of an economic crisis that can be characterized by a significant decrease in market prices, there may be a loss for some model farms - see 2009 and 2010.","[Foltyn, Ivan; Zednickova, Ida; Humpal, Jaroslav] UZEI Praha, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Foltyn, I (通讯作者)，UZEI Praha, Manesova 75, Prague 12056 2, Czech Republic.",foltyn.ivan@uzei.cz,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,35,41,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300003,0

The objective of this study is to analyze specialization and the competitive performance of the Russian agricultural sector and to determine whether or not patterns of comparative advantage for Russia have undergone significant changes over the period 1998-2010. For this purposes we applied complex of methods: classical Balassa's index, Vollrath's index and Lafay index. Moreover we used an analytical tool named products mapping. Balassa's index identified a group of products, which has relatively stable comparative advantage during the whole period. Among those products we can count cereals, their by-products and products of their processing, as well as oilseeds, vegetable oils and chocolate. Vollrath's index showed that the number of products that have revealed competitive advantage was growing during the period and increased from 2% to 8% of all items. Analysis by Lafay's index showed that Russia has comparative advantages in relation to CIS countries and Asian countries due to its geographical location and good trade relations. Analysis by groups of products (according to the degree of processing) revealed a shift of comparative advantage from by-products in 1998-2001 to primary products in 2002-2010. During the second part of the study, we distinguished a group of products that includes 5% of the exported goods, but accounts for about 50% of the value of total agricultural exports. Items in this group have a comparative advantage and positive trade balance. This is the basis of the competitiveness of Russian agricultural exports. This group has been steadily growing. There was also identified the group where 80% of items account for only about 30% of total exports, but 95-99% of the total imports. These items have comparative disadvantage and negative trade balance. There was a reduction in the value of this group. The above trends can be considered as a strengthening of the comparative advantages of Russian agricultural export.","[Ishchukova, Natalia; Smutka, Lubos] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Ishchukova, N (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ, FEM, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",nataliaischukova@mail.ru,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333",,,,,14,0,0,0,8,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2419-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2013,,,,,,,212,218,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338040300019,0

Due to the fact that bribery and other forms of corruption are illegal practices in most countries, the actors of corruption are trying to hide their behavior and revelation of corruption is almost impossible. Negative effects on development of gross domestic product, unemployment rate or credibility of the country discouraging foreign investors have been shown as a result of corruption. For this reason countries spend considerable financial and other resources to build an effective anti-corruption policy. E-government methods could be use as a possible way to reduce corruption by reducing the interaction between officials and the public. The literature focused on e-government methods in relation to corruption suggests that electronic service delivery can reduce corruption by minimizing the interactions with officials, accelerating decisions and reducing human errors. This paper is focused on the potential role of e-government in reducing the level of corruption in the country.

Popular affine jump-diffusion models, however, are still unsatisfactory in describing the options data and the problem is often attributed to the diffusion term of the unobserved state variables. Using prices of variance-swaps (i.e., squared VIX) implied from options prices, we provide fresh evidence regarding the misspecification of affine jump-diffusion models, as variance-swap prices are affine functions of the state variables in a broader class of models that do not restrict the diffusion term of the state variables. We apply the nonparametric methodology used by Ait-Sahalia (1996b), supplemented with bootstrap tests and other parametric tests, to the S&P 500 index options data from January 1996 to September 2008.

In the proposed models, effectiveness of environmental regulation is captured by (i) level of stringency of environmental regulations, (ii) degree of enforcement, and (iii) the achievement of various environmental performance goals. Findings from cross-country regressions support the capture theory where small size and greater availability of resources render industrial groups in SIDS powerful at the legislation level. Rent-seeking behaviour of industrial lobbies appears to be channeled via corrupt practices but is constrained by high dependence of SIDS on international trade as well as improved governance measures and better rule of law. No evidence is obtained on environmental legislative damage caused by agricultural lobbies and tourism sector. At the implementation level, both industry and agriculture are found to be pro-active in terms of noncompliance to environmental legislations causing significant damage to the environment. Weak agricultural lobbies at legislative level in SIDS may be due to extensive government support programs to agriculture, which would serve to dampen or nullify any increment in cost borne by farmers arising from stringent environmental regulations. The impact of tourism lobbies on environmental performance is inconclusive. Tourism lobbies in SIDS have interest in maintaining some level of environmental quality and do not display severe adverse impacts at the implementation phase even after controlling for their interaction with institutional variables (corruption, rule of law and government effectiveness).

Besides, the MS-models show that these empirical relationships are more significant under a higher response regime. At last, the BVAR test yields impulse-response functions showing that shocks in expected rates have more persistent impacts on effective rates than what is observed from the opposite direction.

The biodynamic agriculture is broad topic usually viewed by scholars from the philosophical or biological point of view. The surveys from the economic point of view remind limited. While the organic farming gains the importance in agricultural research with its support from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union, biodynamic stays aside. Both approaches towards the evaluation of the efficiency - parametric or non- parametric - were utilized in the paper. The analysis was done for 4 biodynamic farms in the Czech Republic. Production of the farms was explained by five inputs: material, capital, labor, land and subsidies. Firstly, Farrell's technical efficiency was calculated. Parametric approach was represented by Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and non- parametric by Data envelopment analysis (DEA). The SFA predicted in majority cases lower efficiency level of the input usage by the farms than DEA. While the average efficiency of biodynamic farms varied from 48.67 % to 74.79 % in case of SFA, DEA estimated the efficiency in the interval of 46.85 % to 84.01 %. On the basis of comparison of the analyses results, the appropriate method for further was suggested considering the pros and cons of each method.

A frequently suggested approach to reduce the basis risk is the use of mixed indices composed of several weather variables. The present study compares the risk-reduction potential of a temperature index-based and a precipitation index-based weather derivative to a derivative based on a mixed index including the two weather variables temperature and precipitation. This comparison is based on empirical winter wheat yield data of arable farms in Central Germany as well as on daily weather data of individual weather stations over several years. The hedging effectiveness is maximized using the hedging model by Johnson (1960). The results empirically prove that the improvement of the risk reduction potential of weather derivatives based on a mixed index improves significantly in comparison to single-index derivatives. However, it is more advantageous to use several weather derivatives based on a simple index at the same time than using one derivative based on a mixed index if the weather variables of the mixed index were measured at just one weather station. Hence, providers of weather derivatives would do better by offering different weather derivatives based on a simple index than derivatives that are based on a mixed index. In particular this is worth considering with regard to the fact that weather derivatives based on simple indices will surely attract the interest of other sectors more easily. Furthermore, by showing that farm-individual optimally designed weather indices have a significantly higher risk reduction potential than standardized weather indices, this study provides an important progress for the question about the design of weather derivatives. Hence, providers of weather derivative should better offer different weather derivatives with single index-based, farm-individual, optimally designed indices than a derivative based on a mixed index. The focus of the present study may be relevant for farmers as well as for potential providers of weather derivatives.","[Pelka, Niels; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Pelka, N (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agr Wissensch, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",niels.pelka@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,31,2,2,3,16,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The geological and mineral administrative department should set up a concept of public administration, transform management function, improve management level, reduce management cost and increase efficiency, which finally improves sustainable development of geological and mineral industry in China.","[Song, Wei; Zhou, Jinsheng; Ren, Jianwu] China Univ Geosci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences - Beijing,,897781160@qq.com; zhoujinsheng001@163.com; 404235282@qq.com,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-139-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,34,44,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7HH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337529900007,0

The social value of urban agriculture, such as improving food security, developing a sense of community and promoting ecological conservation, is well documented. But in order to effectively contribute to development agendas, urban agriculture must also present viable, sustainable economic opportunities. This study sets forth vegetable box schemes as a context-appropriate, economically feasible urban agriculture enterprise for which there is growing consumer demand. A survey of 354 subscribers to vegetable box schemes in Cape Town is analysed, finding these households source half of their fresh produce and a quarter of their total groceries from box schemes. The study explores dimensions of consumer satisfaction and considers ways in which box schemes may be expanded. This paper also offers a brief comparison of different box scheme models in order to demonstrate that a development-oriented social enterprise model can compete with other for-profit models in the market.","[Conradie, B.] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7703 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,,amy.thom@uct.ac.za,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300; Thom, Amy/0000-0003-0586-6316",,,,,29,8,9,1,47,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2013,52.0,,,1,SI,,64,86,,10.1080/03031853.2013.770953,0.0,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,103TE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315941000004,0

[3] who analysed how protests affect governments' decisions, but not including class conflict, and Acemouglu [1] who does include class conflict but does not take into account protests. We develop a continuous time framework and obtain a stochastic differential game, where the government as well as the upper and lower social classes represent the players involved in the game. The stationary feedback Nash-equilibrium strategies are derived. Furthermore, we compare the results with another two cases where the government and the upper social class maximize their joint utility and the government transfers some resources to the lower social class. We find that under some specific conditions, the government which transfers some resources to the lower social class is more successful in creating a more harmonious society. (C) 2013 The Authors.

After matching the currency denomination, we examine how the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) was synchronized with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We find remarkably asymmetric responses in market-specific and currency-specific risk during the crisis. The regression results suggest that market-specific credit risk increased the difference across markets, whereas liquidity risk caused the difference across currency denominations. They also support the view that liquidity shortage of the US dollar occurred in international money markets during the crisis. Coordinated central bank liquidity provisions were useful in reducing the liquidity shortage of the US dollar, but their effectiveness was asymmetric across markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We answer this question by estimating a semi-parametric hedonic pricing model for about 90,000 housing units transacted in Hong Kong between 2005 and 2006. We first identify a hedonic price function by locally regressing the rental price of the housing unit on its intrinsic and neighborhood characteristics, one of which is the Gini coefficient for household income of the constituency area. We then combine the estimates with a log utility function to obtain the heterogeneous preference parameters. Finally, we estimate the joint distribution of the preference parameters and demographics. We find that most homeowners have a strong distaste for inequality in their neighborhood, and the distaste increases with income and goes down with education level. Counterfactual experiments show that reallocating public rental housing by half can increase the welfare of homeowners by about HK$8,000 on average per year, an amount which is equivalent to increasing the housing unit by 20 square feet or reducing the age of the unit by 5 years.

Previous literature on local contracting out and on the privatization of state-owned enterprises have offered two competing interpretations on why center-right governments rely more on private providers. Some maintain that center-right politicians contract out more because, like Adam Smith, they believe in market competition. Others claim that center-right politicians use privatization in a Machiavellian fashion; it is used as a strategy to retain power, by `purchasing' the electoral support of certain constituencies. Using a unique dataset, which includes the political attitudes of over 8,000 Swedish local politicians from 290 municipalities for a period of 10 years, this paper tests these ideological predictions together with additional political economy factors which have been overlooked in previous studies, such as the number of veto players. Results first indicate support for the Machiavellian interpretation, as contracting out increases with electoral competition. Second, irrespective of ideological concerns, municipalities with more veto players in the coalition government contract out fewer services.","[Sundell, Anders; Lapuente, Victor] Univ Gothenburg, Qual Govt Inst, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Lapuente, V (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Qual Govt Inst, Box 711,Sprangkullsgatan 19, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",anders.sundell@pol.gu.se; victor.lapuente@pol.gu.se,,"Sundell, Anders/0000-0002-9698-6964",,,,,68,30,34,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2012,153.0,3-4,,,,,469,485,,10.1007/s11127-011-9803-1,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,055SR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312438200013,0

This paper challenges the conventional view by finding a stable demand for M1 in U.S. data from 1959 through 1993. The approach follows previous work in interpreting long-run money demand as a cointegrating relation, and it uses Goldfeld's partial-adjustment model to interpret short-run dynamics. The key innovation is the choice of the interest rate in the money demand function. Most previous work uses a short-term market rate, but this paper uses the average return on near monies-the savings accounts and money market mutual funds that are close substitutes for M1. This choice helps rationalize the behavior of money demand; in particular, the increase in the volatility of velocity after 1980 is explained by increased volatility in the returns on near monies.

In order to capture the long-run impact of tax-financed military R&D on the growth rate, we develop an endogenous growth model in the spirit of Barra [1990]. The model focuses on the optimal sharing of public resources between consumption, civil investment, military R&D and other military expenditures. Taking into account two types of R&D tax-financed military R&D vs private (nonmilitary) R&D allows us to analyze how the government manages the optimal allocation of tax resources between public funding of military R&D on the one side, and the provision of subsidies to private R&D on the other side. The results emphasize the key role played by military R&D in enhancing economic growth and welfare in the long run.","Univ Evry Val Essonne, CNRS, Federat Rech Travail Emploi & Polit Publ FR 3126, EPEE,Dept Econ,Ctr Etud Polit Econ, F-91025 Evry, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay,"Laurent, T (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val Essonne, CNRS, Federat Rech Travail Emploi & Polit Publ FR 3126, EPEE,Dept Econ,Ctr Etud Polit Econ, 4 Bd Francois Mitterrand, F-91025 Evry, France.",laurent@univ-evry.fr,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,26,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Crucially, neoliberal policy-makers found the microcredit concept ideologically compelling, and the international development community soon began to provide massive support to establish and expand the microfinance movement. Today, however, even long-standing microfinance advocates now reluctantly accept that microcredit has actually had no positive impact upon poverty or bottom-up rural development. In fact, those rural communities most exposed to microcredit have been severely damaged in a number of ways, especially through sub-prime-style boom-to-bust episodes. Largely because of its supreme ideological usefulness, the microfinance movement nonetheless still retains some support in the major neoliberal-oriented international development institutions, pro-globalization think-tanks, and in a number of Western governments.","Univ Juraj Dobrila, Pula, Croatia",,"Bateman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Juraj Dobrila, Pula, Croatia.",milfordbateman@yahoo.com,,,,,,,49,35,45,1,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Hence, the higher the potential agency cost as reflected in the firm's stakeholder structure, the more the actual agency cost is reduced by the strong stakeholder's dividend payout decision.

But many believe it led to a holding structure too fragmented to be efficient, and that public efforts to consolidate plots are needed to lay the foundation for greater rural productivity. Farm-level data from the 2005 Albania LSMS allow us to explore this quantitatively. We find no support for the argument that fragmentation reduces productivity. However, producers fail to utilize about 10% of the country's productive land, and this land has, in the majority of cases, been idle for at least 5 years. Farmers quote inefficiently-small plots as the reason for this in very few cases, casting doubt on the scope for land consolidation to solve this issue. Instead, the data are consistent with the notion of land market imperfections, which can be traced to gaps in the legal and policy framework, as well as inefficiencies in registry operations, leading to land abandonment on a large scale. To maintain the productive potential of Albania's rural economy and, if and when needed, the ability to conduct consolidation in a cost-effective and sustainable manner, it will be critical to complement the emphasis on consolidation with an effort to address those gaps and inefficiencies on a priority basis.

The present paper complements their findings by showing that the welfare costs of real rigidities can be substantial compared to nominal frictions.

This result is particularly evident during the second subsample (August 2007-December 2011), where neither macroeconomic variables nor country ratings significantly explain CDS spread changes. Second, measures of US bond, equity, and CDX High Yield returns, as well as emerging market credit returns, are the most dominant drivers of CDS spread changes.

In addition, for market-integrated farmers, intracrop biodiversity does not seem to have a negative effect on yields, which suggests that improved market access does not threaten biodiversity in contexts with similar characteristics to the study site.","[Salazar, Lina] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev & Disaster Risk Management Div, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Winters, Paul] American Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; American University,"Salazar, L (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, Environm Rural Dev & Disaster Risk Management Div, 1300 New York Ave NW,Off SW514, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",lsalazar@iadb.org; winters@american.edu,"Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534",,,,,30,3,4,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We uncover evidence that: (i) the growth rate of deposits is sensitive to bank fundamentals after controlling for macroeconomic factors, diversity in ownership structure, and government intervention; (ii) a bank publicly disclosing more transparent information in its financial reports, is more likely to experience growth in its deposit base; and (iii) banks characterised by high information transparency, well-capitalised and adopted international accounting standards, are more able to attract funds by offering higher interest rates.

Our paper highlights a new channel through which depositors can exercise pressure to control risk-taking. Depositors can reallocate their savings away from their home country to the more protective system of a developed economy. We recover a classical result according to which increased competition resulting from more international financial openness induces banks to take excessive risks. We find however that sufficiently high financial openness is necessary for a positive link between financial transparency and safe risk management.

I argue that this federal program, in many critical aspects, mirrors a governance model developed in the European Union called the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), a model developed in an institutional context whereby the European Commission has no formal authority to coerce member states into coordinating social policy, but nonetheless uses soft or voluntary mechanisms to work toward this goal. Vancouver and Toronto are examined more closely to demonstrate how the flexibility of the OMC-style model manifests itself in practice, and the implications for governance, accountability, and effectiveness. I conclude that while the issue of homelessness is principally plagued by insufficient and unstable funding, further application of principles in the OMC model-uniquely applied to the Canadian context-holds promise for improving governance, coordination, and effectiveness of the public policy response to homelessness. Application of the OMC model thus calls for more attention from Canadian federalism scholars and policy-makers.","Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Dobersten, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,50,4,4,0,26,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The approach combines the behavioural richness of an integrated transport and location choice modelling system (TRESIS) and its outputs to a spatial computable general equilibrium model (SGEM), which uses data at a more aggregate level to compute the additional impacts of transport infrastructure change on the wider economy. This has allowed the development of an integrated transport-location-economy-wide model system known as TRESIS-SGEM.

The Cash for Clunkers program enacted in 2009 is the first nationwide incarnation of such a program in the United States where past programs have been confined to specific regions and states. While measuring the success of such programs in terms of sales is straightforward, measuring their success in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions is not. Much of the difficulty in estimating these reductions relates to projecting how private vehicle owners will use their newer, more fuel efficient vehicles. Using cross-sectional data on how the trade-in vehicles were typically used as well as projected usage increases due to the rebound effect (improvements in fuel efficiency cause more usage), this study estimates emission reductions and their costs for two different vehicle usage scenarios. Estimates from the two scenarios indicate that the nationwide effects of the Cash for Clunkers program on carbon dioxide emissions are modest, at best. Exploration of statewide carbon dioxide emission reductions and costs from Cash for Clunkers indicates that, as suggested by the literature, the environmental benefits of vehicle scrappage programs are limited.

Thus, the suboptimal investment in small companies is one driver of the size effect in PE. A theoretical model and empirical results from a sample of 1,222 funds in the USA support this prediction. The largest 25% of PE funds earn internal rates of return of 5.17% when they invest in the largest 25% of companies but only -2.98% when they invest in the smallest 25%.

Just like most other scholarly work, Hagerstrand's time geography has also received its fair share of criticism from scholars of different philosophical persuasions. In response to these criticisms, Torsten Hagerstrand himself made significant efforts to extend his original framework on time geography to move beyond paths, constraints, prisms, and projects during the last 30 years of his life. Yet these diverse later efforts by Hagerstrand are still scattered in the literature and have not exerted as much influence on time geography research as Hagerstrand's (1970) original paper. The goal of this paper is to take stock of the major extensions Hagerstrand made for time geography between 1970 and 2004. By linking Hagerstrand's shifting views on time geography to the ancient Greek conceptualization of space and time, a unifying framework based upon the Greek manifolds of space and time is proposed for time geography. The new framework not only restores the multiple dimensions of time geography as Hagerstrand envisioned later in his life, but also links the diverse ongoing time geography research efforts to themes derived from the framework. Future research challenges in time geography are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The more recent period is characterized by (i) the absence of a coherent economic policy framework since the end of 2006, (ii) the current account deficit moving to a very high level and no longer being principally determined by the budget deficit as before, (iii) the inadequacy of the institutional framework to address the new, post-stabilization problems, 00 problems such as credit boom, current account and its financing, which are not owned by any policymaking institution being addressed by the Central Bank, and (v) the Central Bank, as it does not have appropriate tools at its disposal to address such problems, creating an efficiency loss in policymaking and an institutional cost for itself In several different contexts we emphasize the importance of giving a mandate to a policymaking institution that has the tools to achieve the mandate.","[Akkaya, Yildtz] Bilkent Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Akkaya, Yildtz] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Boston University,"Akkaya, Y (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Iktisat Bolumu, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",yakkaya@bilkent.edu.tr; refet@bilkent.edu.tr,"GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/Y-9672-2018","GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/0000-0003-4266-7463",,,,,28,10,10,0,16,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

Pollution is regulated by a tradable quota system where some quotas may have been allocated at the outset, i.e. before the quota market is opened. We study how volatility in quota price affects firm behaviour, taking into account the impact of quota price on final-good price. The impact on the individual firm differs depending on how polluting it is-whether it is 'clean' or 'dirty'aEuroand whether it has been allocated quotas at the outset. In the absence of long-term or forward contracting, a grandfathering regime-where clean firms are allocated no quotas and dirty firms are allocated quotas for a part of their emissions-minimizes the impact on firm behavior relative to a risk-neutral benchmark.With forward contracts and in the absence of wealth effects initial quota allocation has no effect on firm behaviour.

Step M1 updates the value, volatility, and expected return on the firm's assets by maximizing the log-likelihood function for the time series of equity prices; Step M2 updates the default barrier by maximizing the equity holders' participation in the firm's asset value. The main contribution of the method lies in the M2 step, which allows for 'endogenizing' the default barrier in light of actual data on equity prices. Using a large international sample of companies, we demonstrate that theoretical credit spreads based on the MM algorithm offer the lowest CDS pricing errors when compared to other, traditional default barrier specifications: smooth-pasting condition value, maximum likelihood estimate, KMV's default point, and nominal debt.

We developed and tested a conceptual model integrating both economic and psychological perspectives. Applying the theory of planned behavior, we examined the economic factors (scientists' human capital, social capital, expected entrepreneurial benefits) as distal predictors (background factors) of academic entrepreneurial intentions. The psychological factors (entrepreneurial attitudes, norms, control perceptions) were examined as proximal intention predictors. Findings were derived from a path analysis utilizing archival and survey data on German scientists (N = 496). We found that attitudes and perceived control predicted entrepreneurial intentions. Social norms in turn had no effect. As regards the economic factors, human and social capital exhibited indirect effects on intentions via entrepreneurial attitudes and control perceptions, while additional direct effects of both capitals showed up significantly as well. Expected benefits from engaging in academic entrepreneurship (i.e., expected financial and reputational gain) only showed indirect effects on intentions via attitudes and perceived control. In addition, longitudinal results indicated that entrepreneurial intentions indeed forecasted entrepreneurial behavior, while certain barriers have a diminishing influence on this relationship. Our results are discussed with an emphasis on the long-neglected importance of the interplay of economic and psychological determinants for scientists' transition to academic entrepreneurship.

Our analysis demonstrates that this feature places limits on catastrophe bond penetration, even if the structure possesses frictional cost advantages over reinsurance. However, we also show that catastrophe bonds have important uses when buyers and reinsurers cannot contract over the division of assets in the event of insolvency and, more generally, cannot write contracts with a full menu of state-contingent payments. In this environment, segregation of collateralin the form of multiple reinsurance companies, as well as catastrophe bond vehiclescan ameliorate inefficiencies due to reinsurance contracting constraints by improving welfare for those exposed to default risk. Numerical simulation illustrates how catastrophe bonds improve efficiency in market niches with correlated risks, or with uneven exposure of buyers to reinsurer default.","[Lakdawalla, Darius] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Zanjani, George] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Lakdawalla, Darius] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",University of Southern California; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; RAND Corporation,"Lakdawalla, D (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",dlakdawa@sppd.usc.edu; gzanjani@gsu.edu,"Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,25,29,34,1,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Following the point-pattern approach proposed by Duranton and Overman (2005), we find the following. First, about half of Japan's manufacturing industries can be classified as localized and the number of localized industries is largest for a distance level of 40 km or less. Second, several industries in the textile mill products sector are among the most localized, which is similar to findings for the UK, suggesting that there exist common factors across countries determining the concentration of industrial activities. Third, the distribution of distances between entrant (exiting) firms and remaining firms is, in most industries, not significantly different from a random distribution. These results suggest that most industries in Japan neither become more localized nor more dispersed over time and are in line with similar findings by Duranton and Overman (2008) for the UK. Fourth, a comparison with the service sector indicates that the share of localized industries is higher in manufacturing than in services, although the extent of localization among the most localized manufacturing industries is smaller than that among the most localized service industries, including financial service industries.

Knowledge of the risk and return of entrepreneurial ventures for outside investors is consequently limited. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the Canadian context, where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are allowed to list on a stock market. We analyze seasoned equity offerings launched by SMEs over the last decade. These public issuers can be considered low quality firms with poor operating performance. Managers issue equity before a large decrease in operating and stock market performance. Individual investors do not price the stocks correctly around the issue and incur significant negative returns in the years following the issue. This is particularly true for constrained issuers. We confirm that entrepreneurial outside equity attracts lemons and that individual investors cannot invest wisely in emerging ventures. Probably as a consequence of individual investors' lack of skill and rationality, the cost of outside equity financing of Canadian public SMEs is abnormally low.","[Carpentier, Cecile; Suret, Jean-Marc] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [L'Her, Jean-Francois] Caisse Depot & Placement Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Suret, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",jean-marc.suret@fsa.ulaval.ca,,"Suret, Jean-Marc/0000-0002-8249-9081; Carpentier, Cecile/0000-0001-6080-9678",,,,,47,8,10,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

With percentage changes in oil spot prices as the predictor, approximately one fifth of industry returns are oil-predictable. We detect a two trading weeks delay in reaction to oil price changes which is consistent with the Hong and Stein (1996) underreaction hypothesis. These results are robust to various alternative specifications, and are shown to be unrelated to time-varying risk premia. Moreover, we demonstrate that trading strategies based on the oil effect generate superior gains in comparison with buy-and-hold strategy in the presence of reasonable trading costs.

Cold water species, such as salmonids, are particularly susceptible to elevated water temperatures. This paper examines the economic value of short-term water temperature forecasts for salmonid management. Forecasts may have economic value if they allow the water resource manager to make better water allocation decisions. This study considers two applications: water releases for management of Chinook salmon in the Klamath River and leasing water from agriculture for management of steelhead trout in the John Day River. We incorporate biophysical models and water temperature distribution data into a Bayesian framework to simulate changes in fish populations and the corresponding benefit from recreational fishing and opportunity cost of water under different temperature forecast accuracies. Simulation results indicate that use of the forecasts results in increased fish production and that marginal costs decline and net benefits increase as forecast accuracy increases, suggesting that provision and use of such stream temperature forecasts would have value to society.

Using this framework, the paper documents four longitudinal case studies of the design and the implementation of management accounting changes. The field studies show how accounting systems are difficult to change despite the formally acknowledged need for change. Findings highlight that the need for change, the technical feasibility of change, the availability of traditional, and the contemporary methodologies are - alone - insufficient reasons to change. A number of other elements interplay in the process of change, namely, the intended MAS use, the stage of the organization life cycle, the potential impact of change on the organization, and the role of key individuals in linking the phases of the change process.","[Zoni, Laura; Dossi, Andrea; Morelli, Marco] SDA Bocconi Sch Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Zoni, L (通讯作者)，SDA Bocconi Sch Management, Via Bocconi 8, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",laura.zoni@sdabocconi.it,"Zoni, Laura/AAK-8540-2021","MORELLI, MARCO/0009-0001-2238-8048; ZONI, Laura/0000-0003-1072-1875; DOSSI, ANDREA/0000-0002-7304-3066",,,,,54,5,8,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

According to Gruner, monetary centralization increases the amplitude of national business cycles, which leads to higher unemployment risk. In order to counter-balance this effect, trade unions lower their claims for wage mark-ups, resulting in lower wage growth and lower unemployment. This paper uses macroeconomic data on OECD countries and a difference-in-differences approach to empirically test the implications of this model.

Following Wood's hypothesis, we allow for the effects of liberalization to vary, depending on the skill intensity of production. The evidence confirms that the role of trade liberalization has been relatively small, but controlling for the presence of endogeneity gives larger estimates.

In this article, we explore this question using a 15-year longitudinal data set from Ethiopia. We compare the findings of an empirical growth model with those derived from a model of the determinants of chronic poverty. We ask whether the chronically poor are simply not benefiting in the same way from the same factors that allowed others to escape poverty, or whether there are latent factors that leave them behind? We find that this chronic poverty is associated with several initial characteristics: lack of physical assets, education and 'remoteness' in terms of distance to towns or poor roads. The chronically poor appear to benefit from some of the drivers of growth, such as better roads or extension services, in much the same way that the non-chronically poor benefit.

While academic research has largely dismissed the procedure owing to its tendency to encourage overbidding, central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of England have continued using it. We investigate this apparent conflict by considering an auction-theoretic setting with private information about declining marginal valuations. Since overbidding entails exposure risk, an equilibrium may exist even if bids are costless and the intended volume is pre-announced. In fact, the allotment quota may be strictly below one with certainty. Also with adaptive expectations, overbidding need not escalate. However, the resulting allocation is typically inefficient. Empirical proxies of exposure risk are significant in both euro and sterling operations.

The historical correlations are consistent with the claim that if in December 2006, the Fed were to have sold off all its Treasury holdings of less than 1-year maturity (about $400 billion) and use the proceeds to retire Treasury debt from the long end, this might have resulted in a 14-basis-point drop in the 10-year rate and an 11-basis-point increase in the 6-month rate. We also develop a description of how the dynamic behavior of the term structure of interest rates changed after hitting the zero lower bound in 2009. Our estimates imply that at the zero lower bound, such a maturity swap would have the same effects as buying $400 billion in long-term maturities outright with newly created reserves and could reduce the 10-year rate by 13 basis points without raising short-term yields.","[Hamilton, James D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Wu, Jing Cynthia] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Chicago,"Hamilton, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",jhamilton@ucsd.edu; cynthia.Wu@chicagobooth.edu,,"Wu, Jing Cynthia/0000-0003-4239-1233",,,,,40,231,268,1,88,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Thus the index has an unusually large number of moving parts, which the producer is essentially free to set. The parsimony of these indices is often appealingcollapsing multiple dimensions into just one, yielding seemingly unambiguous country rankings, and possibly reducing concerns about measurement errors in the component series. But the meaning, interpretation, and robustness of these indices and their implied country rankings are often unclear. If they are to be properly understood and used, more attention needs to be given to their conceptual foundations, the tradeoffs they embody, the contextual factors relevant to country performance, and the sensitivity of the implied rankings to the changing of the data and weights. In short, clearer warning signs are needed for users. But even then, nagging doubts remain about the value-added of mashup indices, and their policy relevance, relative to the dashboard alternative of monitoring the components separately. Future progress in devising useful new composite indices of development will require that theory catches up with measurement practice.","World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mravallion@worldbank.org,,,,,,,57,139,154,1,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

For a given increase in the grant-date firm stock price (and a concurrent increase in return volatility), the increment of total value at the vesting date acts as a proxy for the incentive effects of ESOs. If the option is attached to the existing contract without adjusting cash compensation, we suggest that a firm should not always fix the strike price to the grant-date stock price; instead, the strike price should vary with the length of the vesting period. We also show that, compared with at-the-money options, restricted stock generates greater incentives to increase stock prices in some scenarios, especially when equity-based awards are vested early. If the vesting period is long, the firm could grant options instead of restricted stock to maximize incentives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We find that such a view is consistent with the empirical evidence. Moreover, concerning the real effects of financial shocks within the US, we detect stronger evidence of an asset prices channel, rather than a liquidity channel. Concerning the spillovers to the world economy, we find that while financial disturbances are transmitted to foreign countries through US house and stock price dynamics, as well as excess liquidity creation, the trade channel is the key trasmission mechanism of real shocks.

It introduces a basic framework linking transfers to growth mediating processes and productive capacity outcomes. This is then used to organize and assess relevant findings from program evaluation studies.

Using European micro-level data for 1996-2005, we show that firms in industries with growth opportunities use more external finance in financially more developed countries. This result is particularly strong for firms that are more likely to be financially constrained and dependent on domestic financial markets, such as small and young firms. Our findings are robust to controlling for technological determinants of external finance needs and to using different proxies for growth opportunities. Interestingly, the explanatory power of the measures of technological determinants identified in prior work decreases significantly once growth opportunities are controlled for.

The objectives of this study were to map and quantify the environmental impacts of producing pork in the Western Cape and exporting it to Antwerp in Flanders with the environmental impacts of producing pork in Flanders and delivering it to the same location. The impact categories included are (i) global warming potential (GWP), (ii) eutrophication potential, (iii) acidification potential, and (iv) energy use. By pointing out weak points in the different environmental impact categories, suggestions are made to lower the environmental burdens of pork production. Four main activities of the pork production chain were covered by the LCA, namely: (i) the feed provision activity, which includes the production of raw materials and feed, (ii) the pig farming activity, (iii) the slaughter house activity and (iv) the slurry (treatment) activity. An additional (v) pork shipping activity was added in the case of the Western Cape pork chain. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment was carried out, with a functional unit (FU) of one kg of Western Cape or Flemish pork (carcass weight) delivered to the distribution centre in Antwerp. Flemish GWP, eutrophication potential, acidification potential and energy use are 56%, 65%, 62% and 59% respectively of the Western Cape equivalents. The exporting of pork accounts for less than 8% of environmental impacts in all impact categories. Potential exists in the Western Cape to compete on an environmental par when impacts are measured in terms of a per-area unit. It is therefore recommended that for future comparative South African-European LCA studies of pork or other intensive livestock or poultry production chains, an FU of one kg meat as well as an area unit be used when measuring total eutrophication and acidification impacts.","[Devers, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Louvain, Belgium; [Kleynhans, T.

We first replicate Chemin and extend his analysis in two ways. We test the robustness of propensity score matching results to selection on unobservables using sensitivity analysis, and we investigate propensity score matching estimates of impacts by gender of borrowers. The mainly insignificant impacts of microfinance differ greatly by gender of borrower, but are all vulnerable to selection on unobservables.

In the nearly forty years that energy has been a public policy issue, it has always been characterized by impossible goals concerning reduced oil imports, but in the early years (the 1970s), a reasonably coherent set of measures dealt effectively with the pricing problems that were causing energy shortages. This stands in marked contrast to later energy policy which has evolved into a generalized justification for measures that have little in common other than some relation, however slight, to reducing oil imports. Putting a price on carbon has been a salient aspect of climate policy until recently; however that ambition is fading fast and climate policy has increasingly become, like what remains of energy policy, one among a number of justifications for promoting particular forms of energy, usually renewable energy and energy efficiency The success of latter-day energy policy in achieving the avowed objective, reduced oil import levels, should give pause to those who expect a similar effect on greenhouse gas emissions from the conflation of climate with energy policy.","[Ellerman, Denny] European Univ Inst, Loyola de Palacio Program, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy; [Ellerman, Denny] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ellerman, Denny] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ellerman, Denny] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",European University Institute; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ellerman, D (通讯作者)，Via Boccaccio 151, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",denny.ellerman@eui.eu,,,,,,,9,4,5,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

From the perspective of economic exchange, this relationship is relatively specific, as an uneven rank and position of the agents involved play an important role here. It is argued that this unevenness arises from several different factors, such as education and qualification, work experience, path dependence, and the nature of goods and services provided. The relationship specificity is then discussed from a theoretical point of view while its most important elements are highlighted and put into a wider context. Further, market approach in healthcare system and healthcare services is partially debated and a simple model analyzing the double-standard treatment is developed. Subsequently, this type of treatment is analyzed with the aid of vertical differentiation approach. Based on economic rationale, the authors claim that medical knowledge/information obligation should play a crucial role in all healthcare services.

Childhood lead poisoning presents an interesting case study of the potential of preventive care in reducing the prevalence of a disease. There is a clear, well-defined pathway of exposure (deteriorating lead paint in older homes) and no method of secondary care that effectively mitigates the negative health effects. I find that a one-tenth percentage point increase in the proportion of older housing units that have been remediated is associated with a four-tenths percentage point reduction in the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning, an elasticity of roughly 0.5. Citywide, this is roughly 2.5 cases of lead poisoning averted for every housing unit remediated. Furthermore, I find evidence that the effect of remediations in preventing the disease has improved over time. The lower bound estimates of the benefits associated with the reduction in lead poisoning - increased expected lifetime earnings and reduced medical expenditures - are two to twenty times the estimated costs of the remediations.

J,"Jones, RW",,,,"Jones, Ronald W.",,,Real wages and non-traded goods,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Real wages; Non-traded goods; Terms of trade,TRADE,"This paper examines the connection between a terms-of-trade improvement and the real wage rate for a country that is immersed in a trading world with many traded commodities as well as a non-tradeable. There is an array of commodities that are imported but not produced at home, and the price of one of these commodities is lowered, which would, by itself, raise real wage rates if local wage rates are tied to world prices with sufficient diversity in local production to tie factor prices to world commodity prices. If the improvement is sufficiently great, the home country may cease production of one of its tradeables, and the price of non-tradeables changes to clear its market. Details of how this affects the real wage rate depend upon two attributes: Is the non-tradeable labor-intensive relative to the remaining tradeable, and is the income effect of increasing the demand for non-tradeables overpowered by the substitution effect tending to reduce demand? Furthermore, with large changes new traded commodities enter the production mix, so that factor prices once again are tied to world prices. And a wealthier country with the same technology may find its real wage improving at the same time as the opposite change takes place in the home country. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the significant difference in satisfaction means reported by the students from various socio-physical backgrounds. Particularly, it examines the statistically significant differences from the aspects of gender, mix-ethnicity, economic status, and previous home experience. Data were obtained from the face-to-face survey, administered to 495 participants who stayed on-campus at Malaysian Research Universities. These were analyzed using descriptive, T-test, and One-way ANOVA. Generally, the results show that significant differences can be seen in a different way from every aspect and obviously reveals that students were adapted to live in shared campus environment. Consequently, it is hoped that the findings of this study should therefore be valuable and considered by the universities management in an attempt to improve the quality of their future campus house.

The legitimization processes of two cases are analyzed: the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Roundtable on Responsible Soy. From this analysis explanations for the specific development of such a process are derived. The first level of explanation is actor-based and addresses the factors trust and collaborative advantage. The second level refers to institutional factors that provide opportunities and constraints for legitimate interactions to develop, such as the structure of the commodity chain, the type of lead firms in it and the role of governmental policies.

We used GARCH specifications taking into account several effects (symmetrical, asymmetrical, linear, nonlinear, threshold, power, level shift and jump intensity) in order to evaluate the empirical relationship between these variables and identify which of these effects is the most powerful. Our results reveal that whether for importing or exporting-oil economy, the real price of oil is negatively and significantly related to the variability of real exchange rate, which is remarkable across all estimates and all the effects considered. By introducing a dummy variable representing the two oil crises and the Asian crisis, the relationship between oil prices and the exchange rate has become more volatile and more persistent for the importing country and less intense for the exporting country, which means that the interaction oil price-exchange rate volatility depends greatly on switching regime.

Despite the growing understanding of policy changes that would lead to increases in children's active transport, it has not been possible to reverse the trends in children's mobilities in most nations. This paper focuses on the potential for using two Disney-Pixar movies as allegories for the links between children's mobilities and major resource, health and environmental issues facing humanity. These include energy stress (particularly oil vulnerability), the health impacts of decreasing physical activity, and the likely environmental outcomes of 'business as usual' in modern western societies. The paper explains how the use of themes in Monsters, Inc. and WALL-E, facilitates the harnessing of the positive affect that may motivate changes in values and behaviour to enhance children's independent mobility and active transport.

This article seeks to test the robustness of these results. To do this, we construct four versions of a survey instrument (i.e., a 2 X 2 design). The instrument varies the number of competitors and the individual's proximity to a standard. The instrument tests the robustness of the results by asking respondents to make decision about effort (rather than a distribution) and allows the impact of competitive decisions on other competitors to vary inversely with the number of competitors. Across the entire sample, respondents in proximity to the standard show more competitive behavior. However, this effect is due entirely to changes in the behavior of men. Finally, we find that the n-effect is not robust when competitive behavior has an impact on others.","[Vandegrift, Donald; Holaday, Brian] Coll New Jersey, Dept Econ, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA",College of New Jersey,"Vandegrift, D (通讯作者)，Coll New Jersey, Dept Econ, 2000 Pennington Rd, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA.",vandedon@tcnj.edu,,,,,,,22,5,5,0,8,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The main goal is to increase the competitiveness, flexibility, adaptability and reactivity of enterprises in the ceramic industry. Since the ceramic sector represents an important part in the manufacturing industry, we focused on this sector, with the aim of evaluating the development of enterprises activating in this domain. The importance of this research lies in its uniqueness and effectiveness, as the performance indicators were analyzed with multiple regression analysis, in the case of an enterprise that produces technical ceramic products. This analysis generally belongs to the multivariate methods, and it is also an explanatory method of analysis. Regression analysis describes the relationship between a dependent variable and several independent variables. The dependent variable consisted in the size of the profit, while the independent variables were the following: self-financing capacity, return on equity, degree of technical endowment, personnel cost per employee and investment per person employed. The selected variables were monitored throughout ten years. The results showed that three of the variables analyzed are very significant predictors for the magnitude of profit. We could also find significant correlations between the analyzed indicators. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The size of local labour markets is determined in part by geography and tradition, but advances in transportation have the potential to move people and communities closer together and transform established mindscapes. In Iceland, the dispersion of the rural population, a challenging terrain, and unpredictable weather has made road infrastructure improvements a key component in regional development strategies. A large-scale tunnel project completed in 2010 was intended to strengthen a vulnerable rural area on the northern coast and expand the urban labour market of the regional centre of Akureyri. Traffic surveys and resident surveys conducted before and after the tunnels show a substantial increase in 17-34 km work travel between rural communities. Work travel 61-77 km to and from the regional centre did however not increase. The average length of work travel has shortened but the increase in commuting yielded a net increase in total km commuted. The tunnels increased work travel irrespective of age and education, but increased work travel by women with children in the household in particular. The results suggest that large-scale road infrastructure improvements may substantially strengthen rural labour markets within a driving distance of 15-30 min, but may not extend the edge of micropolitan labour markets 45-60 min from an urban centre of less than 20 thousand inhabitants.

Drawing from a dual systems framework, we hypothesize that glucose administration will increase response times and improve Bayesian accuracy because it should shift decision making toward the more deliberate system 2 and away from the more automatic system 1 decision process. We study 113 subjects randomly assigned to either a glucose or placebo drink condition, who make choices in incentivized easy and difficult Bayesian task trials. Our results indicate a significant robust effect of glucose on response times. Glucose administration has a main effect of increasing response time, as predicted, and it also facilitates faster response times across trials. We do not find a direct impact of glucose administration on Bayesian accuracy, but we do estimate an impact of response times on accuracy that differs by task difficulty. This suggests an indirect impact of glucose on decision outcomes via its impact on response times.","[Dickinson, David L.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [McElroy, Todd] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Psychol, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA; [Stroh, Nathan] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Psychol, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; State University System of Florida; Florida Gulf Coast University; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Dickinson, DL (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",dickinsondl@appstate.edu,,,Walker College of Business at Appalachian State University,Walker College of Business at Appalachian State University,"The authors thank the Walker College of Business at Appalachian State University for funding the experiments for this research.

Among non-regular employees, those who work on a full-time basis are found to receive a higher density of both on-the-job training (OJT) and off-the-job training (Off-JT). Participation in firm-provided training is shown to improve job skills and productivity, but does not appear to impact the wage growth of non-regular workers. However, training participation is shown to make the transition from non-regular to regular employment in the current occupation more likely, enhancing the probability of future wage increases. J.

Our approach combines the asymmetric GARCH (GJR) model that allows the high-order moments (i.e., skewness and kurtosis) of the skewed generalized t (SGT) distribution to rely on the past information set to estimate volatility, and the modified Hill estimator (Huisman et al., 2001) for estimating the innovation distribution tail of the GJR model. Using back-testing of the daily return series of 10 stock markets, the empirical results show that our proposed approach could give better one-day VaR forecasts than McNeil and Frey (2000) and the GJR/GARCH models with alternative distributions. In addition, our proposed approach also provides the accuracy of expected shortfall estimates. The evidence demonstrates that our proposed two-step approach that incorporates the modified Hill estimator into the GJR model based on the SGT density with autoregressive conditional skewness and kurtosis provides consistently accurate VaR forecasts in the short and longer sample periods.

But have these institutional changes led to reductions in forest degradation and improvements in welfare? It is important to ask this question because reducing deforestation and degradation is a public policy goal, and rural households depend on forests to meet their subsistence needs. This article examines the literature on the Joint Forest Management program in India and the Community Forestry Programme in Nepal. The emerging evidence suggests that community forest management may indeed be contributing to improved forest health in South Asia. However, the impacts on household welfare appear to be far more varied but have also been less carefully studied. The article concludes that policies that further clarify resource rights and support local monitoring would strengthen and improve community forestry.

Using hierarchical cross-country regression analyses, this paper seeks to answer the question what types of banks profit most from fees charged? It also highlights the country level factors that influence banks' ability to profit from fees charged. The factors at the country level distinguish between those that relate specifically to the financial services industry and broader macroeconomic indicators. The paper also identifies three channels through which national culture impacts banks' ability to make high profits from fees. This paper uses the most comprehensive set of explanatory variables in studies of this nature. It has also extended the spatial scope of previous studies on bank fees by including data on banks from 46 developed and developing countries. In light of swelling public pressure on governments to do 'something' about bank fees, ill-advised measures are highlighted. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reviews the development of low cost carriers (LCCs) and assesses its effects on both of domestic and international charter markets in Japan since 2007. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the effect of scheduled services deregulation on international tourism to Japanese regional areas in relation to charter services. The results suggest that in the domestic market, LCC operations have seldom impacted charter traffic due to the differences in target markets and routes. In the international market, LCCs launched scheduled services to Japan but mainly on high demand routes. The deregulation of scheduled services led to a passenger shift from charters to newly scheduled flights and a concentration of tourist arrivals in regional centres.

Several researchers have used micro level data to establish the link between trade finance and trade, especially so during the financial crisis, and have found diverting results. This paper analyses the effect of trade credit on trade on a macro level through a whole cycle. We employ Berne Union data on export credit insurance, the most extensive dataset on trade credits available at the moment, for the period of 2005-2011. Using an instrumentation strategy we can identify a significantly positive effect of insured trade credit, as a proxy for trade credits, on trade. The effect of insured trade credit on trade is very strong and remains stable over the cycle, not varying between crisis and non-crisis periods.","[Auboin, Marc] World Trade Org, Econ Res & Stat Div, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Engemann, Martina] Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch, D-80799 Munich, Germany",World Trade Organization; University of Munich,"Engemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Grad Sch, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",Marc.Auboin@wto.org; engemann.martina@web.de,,"Auboin, Marc/0000-0002-1276-8426",,,,,35,38,41,5,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We find that a firm's leverage decreases when institutional ownership increases. This result implies that a firm reduces its debt level as institutional investors substitute for the monitoring role of debt. More importantly, we find that a firm's suboptimal leverage decreases when the institutional ownership increases, and institutional ownership decreases when a firm's suboptimal leverage increases. This finding shows that institutions not only effectively monitor a firm's capital structure but they also passively sell their shares when dissatisfied with it. In addition, we find that the monitoring evidence on a firm's leverage and suboptimal leverage are more pronounced when the institutional investors are less likely to have business relationships with a firm or the information asymmetry is high in the market.

Our results identify a general difference between stakeholder and shareholder banks: following a monetary policy contraction, stakeholder banks decrease their loan supply to a lesser extent than shareholder banks. A detailed analysis of the effect among stakeholder banks reveals that cooperative banks continued to smooth the impact of tighter monetary policy on their lending during the crisis period (2008-2011), whereas savings banks did not.

We show that index membership enhances all aspects of liquidity, whereas stocks that leave the index exhibit no significant liquidity change. We also show that the liquidity risk premium and the cost of equity capital decline significantly after additions, but do not exhibit any significant change following deletions. The control sample analysis indicates that observed decline in liquidity premium and the cost of equity capital is not driven by factors other than index revisions. Our evidence is consistent with Journal of Financial Economics, 1, 17 (1986)'s argument that since liquidity is priced, an increase in liquidity will result in lower expected returns. Furthermore, the asymmetric impact of additions and deletions on stock liquidity and cost of capital is consistent with the view that the benefits of index membership are permanent (see, e.g. Journal of Finance, 59, No. 4 1901-29, August 2004; Journal of Investment Management 4, 23-37, 2006).

Using a case study of a potato cluster in China, we show that industrial policymaking at the local level contributes greatly to economic development as well. Many of the industrial policies affecting the cluster-including leveling land, developing better varieties, establishing a potato trade association, lobbying for increasing freight car quotas, and attracting processing firms-were implemented at the local level, highlighting the need for discussion of local industrial policymaking as a major determinant of cluster development. As the case study demonstrates, economic development is a continuous process with constantly evolving binding supply-side and demand-side constraints. Often, after a local policy helps remove one binding constraint, a new one emerges that, in turn, may require a new set of policies. Therefore, the success of clusters depends upon local industrial policies that respond to emerging binding constraints at different stages of the cluster's development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The grants from central government can improve income and tax revenues distribution of local governments; however, the centrally allotted tax revenues have inverse effects and the total fiscal transfers have ambiguous effects.

Bank payouts, therefore, constitute a type of risk-shifting that benefits equity holders at the expense of debt holders. In this paper, we provide insights on how CEO incentives stemming from inside debt (primarily defined benefit pensions and deferred compensation) impact bank payout policy in a manner that protects debt holder interests. We show that CEOs with higher inside debt relative to inside equity are associated with more conservative bank payout policies. Specifically, CEOs paid with more inside debt are more likely to cut payouts and to cut payouts by a larger amount. Reductions in payouts occur through a decrease in both dividends and repurchases. Our results also hold over a subsample of TARP banks where we expect the link between risk-shifting and payouts to be of particular relevance because it involves wealth transfers from the taxpayer to equity holders. We conclude that inside debt can help in addressing risk-shifting concerns by aligning the interests of CEOs with those of creditors, regulators, and in the case of TARP banks, the taxpayer.

In the context of urbanisation and globalisation, waterfront redevelopment provides not only various opportunities but also unprecedented challenges for the Chinese port cities. From a sustainability perspective, addressing the challenges requires thoroughly analysing the factors driving waterfront redevelopment and discovering the issues facing those coastal port cities. After reviewing the historical process of port development, based on the case of the eastern Dalian port areas, this paper attempts to explore the key factors behind the redevelopment and to discover the main issues facing Dalian cityport. The results show that forces at the global, national and local levels jointly drive redevelopment activities and that some national factors, such as aggressive real estate development in the past decade, play a remarkable role in this phenomenon. Consequently, timing on redevelopment, historic building conservation, reconnection of the waterfront to the city, and building a democratic decision-making process together challenge the sustainable future of redeveloped waterfronts in Dalian cityport and in other historic port cities in China.

We show how this information can be exploited to produce accurate forecasts of bond excess returns and to construct profitable investment strategies in bond markets. We use an exponential tilting method for incorporating market expectations into forecasts from a standard term-structure model and then derive the implied forecasts for bond excess returns. We find that the method delivers substantial improvements in out-of-sample accuracy relative to a number of benchmarks. The accuracy improvements are both statistically and economically significant for bond maturities of up to two years and forecast horizons less than one year, and would have allowed an investor to obtain positive cumulative excess returns from simple riding the yield curve investment strategies over the past ten years. For long forecast horizons and bond maturities of four or five years, the preferred forecast is instead one implied by a simple autoregressive model.","[Altavilla, Carlo] European Cent Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Giacomini, Raffaella] UCL, Cemmap, CEPR, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Costantini, Riccardo] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",European Central Bank; University of London; University College London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University College London,"Giacomini, R (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",r.giacomini@ucl.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,9,10,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The Macro-Network comprises of linkages across financial and non-financial Sectors in each country. These country-level sector networks are then connected by the cross-border links between the individual banking sectors. Using the Macro-Network to simulate financial shocks, we find that the propagation effects depend on the underlying network structure, which evolves overtime. After the financial crisis, bilateral linkages contracted sharply, reflecting the surge in counterparty risk and the de-leveraging processes. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that even after this process, vulnerabilities remained in the euro area financial system, while a more diversified portfolio of cross-border exposures might mitigate the shock effects.

Following Kelo vs. New London 2005, the powers of eminent domain were extended, opening the door for potential abuses of power by government officials. In this paper, I empirically investigate the use of eminent domain using newly digitized records from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which extensively used eminent domain to construct dams in the 1930s. Using a sample of families living in one reservoir location, I find empirical evidence that land tenure, the number of property holdings, and debt levels affected the holdout decision, suggesting that holdouts are individuals with high subjective values. I then develop a screening model with asymmetric information in seller valuations to predict when eminent domain will be used and what settlement values and court awards would be. I test the model's and find that individuals who held out increased their property value by about 5 %, and incentives to holdout existed only for individuals who received initially low settlement proposals.","Univ Mississippi, NBER, University, MS 38655 USA",University of Mississippi; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kitchens, C (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, NBER, 333 Holman Hall, University, MS 38655 USA.",kitchct@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,26,7,10,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2014,160.0,3-4,,,,,455,466,,10.1007/s11127-013-0102-x,0.0,,,12,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AL7VN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339344600009,0

We show that consumer confidence and the output gap both affect excess returns on stocks in many European countries: When the output gap is positive (the economy is doing well), expected returns are low, and when consumer confidence is high, expected returns are also low. Consumer confidence and the output gap are also highly positively correlated. In fact, we find that consumer confidence does not contain independent information (i.e. information over and above that contained by the output gap) about expected returns. Our use of European data allows us to examine both aggregate European and local-country data on consumer confidence and output gaps. We find that even local-country consumer confidence does not contain independent information about expected returns. Our findings have asset pricing implications: We show that the cross-country distribution of expected returns is better captured when using the European output gap as a risk factor.

In this paper we review parametric tests and a recently developed nonparametric test (Su and Spindler) and discuss the underlying assumptions. As an illustrative example, we apply the tests to hospital daily benefits which is part of the accident/disability insurance. We compare the results and show that the pattern of asymmetric information is mixed. The main finding is that we detect asymmetric information for low insured sums, but not for high insured sums which is a surprising result. We can also show that in certain ranges both types of test deliver similar results, while under certain circumstances, approaches using aggregation to binary variables might run into difficulties.","[Spindler, Martin] Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Max Planck Soc, Munich, Germany; [Spindler, Martin] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Max Planck Society; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Spindler, M (通讯作者)，Munich Ctr Econ Aging, Max Planck Soc, Munich, Germany.",mspindl@mit.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

This study shows that incentive is an important factor for understanding the learning by doing effect by analysts. We examine analysts' response to a complex type of information - corporate pension underfunding. Pension underfunding negatively impacts future earnings and analysts on average underreact to such information in their earnings forecasts. More importantly, when there is a strong incentive for analysts to deliver accurate forecasts, analyst learning effectively reduces their underreaction to pension underfunding information. On the other hand, when such an incentive is absent, the analyst learning effect is not discernible in the data. Further evidence suggests that analyst learning and incentive jointly reduce stock market mispricing associated with corporate pension underfunding. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Discrete-time duration models are employed to investigate whether the business cycle impacts differently on the survival likelihood of NTBFs vis-A -vis other entrepreneurial firms. Our main findings are three. First, NTBFs generally experience a lower hazard rate compared to other entrepreneurial firms, which is interpreted as a sign of their high 'quality.' Second, all entrepreneurial firms are sensitive to and follow a pro-cyclical pattern of survival likelihood over the business cycle. Three, when comparing NTBFs with the broader group of other entrepreneurial firms, we find that NTBFs are more sensitive to business cycle fluctuations. The above results come with a qualification, though. The sensitivity during the business cycle mainly pertains to self-employed NTBFs. Also, NTBFs' higher survivability is only linked to not being characterized as self-employed.","[Ejermo, Olof] Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Xiao, Jing] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Xiao, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Lund, Sweden.",olof.ejermo@circle.lu.se; jing.xiao@circle.lu.se,"Ejermo, Olof/K-7293-2012",,,,,,74,33,43,1,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

To address the interdependence of financial product choice and domain-specific investor sophistication, we construct and employ a novel, comprehensive measure of annuity literacy. The results from a representative survey among German consumers reveal that both established rational and so far untested behavioral motives are significant barriers to annuitize wealth. Furthermore, the overall level of annuity literacy is rather low, with most respondents lacking knowledge of an annuity's core mechanics.

The Summary Innovation Index (SII) of Lithuania was applied to assess the impact of implementing policies promoting research and development in Lithuania.

These indices represent different markets in terms of their institutional and balance sheet characteristics. The empirical results posit that stock market indices are generally difficult to predict accurately. However, our results reveal some point forecasting capacity for a 15-week horizon at the 95 per cent confidence level for the DJIA index, and for nine-week horizon at the 99 per cent confidence for the DJIM index, using the non-parametric regressions. On the other hand, the ratio of the correctly predicted signs (the success ratio) shows a percentage above 60 per cent for both indices which is evidence of predictability for those indices. This predictability is however statistically significant only four-weeks ahead for the DJIM case, and twelve weeks ahead for the DJIA as their respective success ratios differ significantly from the 50 percent, the expected percentage for an unpredictable time series. In sum, it seems that the forecastability of DJIM is slightly better than that of DJIA. This result on the forecastability of DJIM adds to its other findings in the literature that cast doubts on its suitability in hedging and asset allocation in portfolios that contain conventional stocks.

The analysis takes advantage of a unique setting in which the Shanghai Stock Exchange offered more trade transparency to market participants subscribing to a new software package. First, the results show that the additional data disclosure increased trading activity, but also increased transactions costs through wider bid-ask spreads. Thus, in contrast to popular policy belief, the paper finds that more transparency need not improve market liquidity. Second, the paper finds a particularly strong immediate liquidity impact accompanied by altered trading behavior, which suggests a significant impact on institutional traders subscribing relatively early. Lastly, since the effective level of market transparency is bound to depend on how many traders are subscribing to the data, the study can empirically establish the functional form between market-wide transparency and liquidity. The relationship is non-monotonic, which can explain the lack of consensus in the existing literature where each empirical study is naturally confined to specific parts of the transparency domain.

The results show a significantly positive association between a firm's corporate governance quality and the gains of its alliance partners. The proposition that firms with good governance more greatly value the interests of stakeholders whose devotion is critical is further supported by our findings of significantly positive moderating effects of the following three factors: a firm's growth potential, its business relatedness with its counterparts, and the activity types that the alliance encompasses (technical versus non-technical).

Rather than concentrating low income households in designated developments, vouchers allow families to choose their housing units and neighborhoods. In this project we explore whether low income households use the flexibility provided by vouchers to reach neighborhoods with high performing schools. Unlike previous experimental work, which has focused on a small sample of voucher holders constrained to live in low-poverty neighborhoods, we look at the voucher population as a whole and explore the broad range of neighborhoods in which they live. Relying on internal data from HUD on the location of assisted households, we link each voucher holder in the country to the closest elementary school within their school district. We compare the characteristics of the schools that voucher holders are likely to attend to the characteristics of those accessible to other households receiving place based housing subsidies, other similar unsubsidized households and fair market rent units within the same state and metropolitan area. These comparisons provide us with a portrait of the schools that children might have attended absent HUD assistance. In comparison to other poor households in the same metropolitan areas, we find that the schools near voucher holders have lower performing students than the schools near other poor households without a housing subsidy. We probe this surprising finding by exploring whether differences between the demographic characteristics of voucher holders and other poor households explain the differences in the characteristics of nearby schools, and whether school characteristics vary with length of time in the voucher program. We also examine variation across metropolitan areas in the relative quality of schools near to voucher holders and whether this variation is explained by economic, socio-demographic or policy differences across cities.

Although these methods create better-matched treatment and comparison groups on observables, the issue of selection on unobservables still looms large. Thus, in the absence of being able to run randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or natural experiments, it is important to understand how well different regression-based estimators perform in terms of minimizing pure selection bias, that is, selection on unobservables. We examine the relative magnitudes of three sources of pure selection bias: heterogeneous response bias, time-invariant individual heterogeneity (fixed effects [FEs]), and intertemporal dependence (autoregressive process of order one [AR(1)]). Because the relative magnitude of each source of pure selection bias may vary in different policy contexts, it is important to understand how well different regression-based estimators handle each source of selection bias. Expanding simulations that have their origins in the work of Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (), we find that difference-in-differences (DID) using equidistant pre- and postperiods and FEs estimators are less biased and have smaller standard errors in estimating the Treatment on the Treated (TT) than other regression-based estimators. Our data analysis using the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program replicates our simulation findings in estimating the TT.","[Jung, Haeil] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pirog, Maureen A.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Pirog, Maureen A.] Univ Washington, Daniel J Evans Sch Publ Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pirog, Maureen A.] Univ Johannesburg, Sanlam Ctr Publ Management & Governance, Johannesburg, South Africa",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Johannesburg,"Jung, H (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",hij@indiana.edu; pirog@indiana.edu,,,,,,,34,7,10,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

Our baseline VSL estimates are $7.7 million and $8.3 million (Y$2001). There is no statistically significant divergence between willingness-to-accept VSL estimates associated with wage increases for greater risks and willingness-to-pay VSL estimates as reflected in wage changes for decreases in risk. Our focal result contrasts with the literature documenting a considerable asymmetry in tradeoff rates for increases and decreases in risk. An important implication for policy is that it is reasonable to use labor market estimates of VSL as a measure of the willingness to pay for additional safety.","[Kniesner, Thomas J.] Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Kniesner, Thomas J.] IZA, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Ziliak, James P.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Viscusi, W.

We consider a firm facing a financial market characterized by asymmetric information and significant costs in the event of financial distress. The firm can raise capital either by issuing mandatory convertibles, or by issuing more conventional securities like straight debt, ordinary convertibles, or equity. We show that, in equilibrium, the firm issues straight debt or ordinary convertibles if the extent of asymmetric information facing it is large, but the probability of being in financial distress is relatively small; it issues mandatory convertibles if it faces a smaller extent of asymmetric information but a greater probability of financial distress. Our model provides a rationale for the three commonly observed features of mandatory convertibles: mandatory conversion, capped (or limited) capital appreciation, and a higher dividend yield compared to common stock. We also characterize the equilibrium design of mandatory convertibles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, spatial variation in tolls has not received much attention, especially in practice. Spatial variation could effectively reduce congestion and increase profits. To fill this gap, we conduct an empirical application on 3 different road segments using the Fresno, California's transportation planning model. Our modeling results in a number of interesting insights. First, the derived optimal flat toll values are very close to the average variable tolls, but the effects of applying spatially variable tolls on improving total revenues (from 4% to 24%) and total improved travel time (from 18% to 1083%) measures are significant. Second, spatially variable tolls are more effective, but more costly, particularly for arterials, which can be attributed to the higher number of access points for arterials. Third, spatial variations in tolls are more effective for peak hours than for off-peak hours and for social optimization than for profit maximization. Fourth, to improve throughputs for both profit maximization and social optimization, the prevalent tolling pattern along a corridor induces lower final volumes per capacity (V/Cs) (after pricing) at the mainline flow sections and relatively higher final V/Cs at the entrance and exit (boundary) points. Finally, optimal toll patterns are not dependent on vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) or volumes but, rather, are related to targeted V/Cs. Therefore, flow-dependent charges along a corridor should be based on V/Cs rather than on volumes or VMTs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the range of parameter values we consider, we report the truncated scoring rules that maximize the likelihood of implementing the Borda outcome and how the maximum likelihood changes with m and n. We also present our results on the relative performances of some popular truncated voting rules, such as plurality and approval voting, in implementing the Borda outcome and demonstrate that two-level approval voting performs significantly better than the plurality rule.

Contrary to previous studies, we find that market variables have explanatory power after controlling for firm-specific variables inspired by structural models. Three explanatory variables appear to outperform the other variables examined in this paper: Stock Return, the change in stock return volatility, and the change in the median CDS spread in the rating class. We also find that models used in the event study literature to explain spread changes can be improved by adding market variables. Furthermore, we show that ratings explain cross-sectional variation in CDS spreads even after controlling for structural model variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Regression discontinuity results suggest that, in the fourth quarter of 2001, stress increased by nearly an extra half day per 30 days (11.9%) among ever smoking adults. In the 2 years after 9/11, smoking prevalence increased by 1.1 percentage points (2.3%) among ever smoking adults, resulting in between 950,000 and 1,300,000 adult former smokers becoming smokers again because of terrorism. The net cost to the government was between $530 million and $830 million through the end of 2003. Adults reported disproportionate stress increases based on community military participation and education. Simultaneity between smoking and stress is addressed by an instrumental variables model, providing validity to the hypothesized causal pathway between terrorism, stress, and smoking. This model suggests that an extra day of stress per 30 days causes a 3.4 percentage point increase in smoking among ever smoking adults. Results help to quantify a hidden cost of terrorism and provide a better understanding of utility maximization during periods of high stress.

Data on illegal migrants from three field surveys conducted in Bangladesh from April 2009 to November 2010 are used. The results show that the total payments made to traffickers vary with easily observed characteristics (gender, age, marital status) but do not vary with details of the migration process (training provided, time spent in the trafficker's queue). These relationships are consistent with exploitation. Migration-debt contracts are more prevalent when the costs of illegal migration are relatively high, which adds empirical support to theoretical models such as Friebel and Guriev (2006).

We show that a model with a collateral constraint in which learning about the risk of a new financial environment interacts with Fisherian amplification produces a boom-bust cycle in debt, asset prices and consumption. Early realizations of a high-borrowing-ability regime turn agents optimistic about the persistence probability of this regime.

Our test has significant advantages over existing ones, because it is more direct, and can jointly test the so-called quiet-life hypothesis, which predicts that in a concentrated market firms do not minimize costs. We then apply this test to large banks in Japan. Consistent with the ES hypothesis, we find that more efficient banks become larger. We also find that market concentration reduces banks' efficiency, which supports the quiet-life hypothesis. These findings imply that there is an intriguing growth-efficiency dynamic throughout banks' life cycle, although our findings also suggest that the ES hypothesis dominates the quiet-life hypothesis in terms of economic impact.

We find that resource abundance has a positive effect on economic growth at the provincial level in China between 1990 and 2008, an effect that depends nonlinearly on institutional quality (1995 confidence in courts).

We found that the fees charged by Japanese underwriters were higher on average than those of foreign underwriters, but the difference could be explained by conditioning on issue characteristics. Our results also suggest that bond issuers sorted properly across underwriters, as switching across underwriter nationalities would be expected to result in higher fees. However, the savings enjoyed by firms issuing with foreign underwriters were modest and statistically insignificant, while those of firms issuing with Japanese underwriters were substantial and statistically significant. This result suggests that Japanese underwriters priced their services aggressively over the sample period, perhaps in an effort to retain or gain market share. This conjecture is supported by a matching exercise that examined the liberalization of foreign underwriter access to the Samurai bond market, using euro-yen bond issues as a control. Foreign entry led to a statistically and economically significant decrease of 16 basis points on average in underwriting fees in the Samurai bond market. Overall, our results suggest that the international market for Japanese bond underwriting services was partially segmented by nationality as issuers appear to have preferred habitats, but that liberalization increased overall market competition.","[Lopez, Jose A.; Spiegel, Mark M.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Lopez, JA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",jose.a.lopez@sf.frb.org; mark.spiegel@sf.frb.org,,"Martinez-Lopez, Jose Angel/0000-0002-6871-7265",,,,,27,3,3,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Herein we examine if people avoid costless information on those externalities and use ignorance as an excuse to reduce pro-environmental behavior. We develop a theoretical framework in which people feel internal pressure (guilt) from causing harm-to the environment (e.g., emitting carbon dioxide) as well as external pressure to conform to the social norm for pro-environmental behavior (e.g., offsetting carbon emissions). Our model predicts that people may benefit from avoiding information on their harm to the environment, and that they use ignorance as an excuse to engage in less pro-environmental behavior. It also predicts that the cost of ignorance increases if people can learn about the social norm from the information. We test the model predictions empirically using an experiment combined with a stated-preference survey involving a hypothetical long-distance flight and an option to buy offsets for the flight's carbon footprint. More than half (53 percent) of the subjects choose to ignore information on the carbon footprint alone before deciding their offset purchase, but ignorance significantly decreases (to 29 percent) when the information additionally reveals the share of air travelers who buy carbon offsets. We find evidence that some people use ignorance as an excuse to reduce pro-environmental behavior-ignorance significantly decreases the probability of buying carbon offsets.","[Thunstrom, Linda] HUI Res AB, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Thunstrom, Linda; van't Veld, Klaas; Shogren, Jason F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Wyoming; Lund University; University of Copenhagen,"Thunström, L (通讯作者)，HUI Res AB, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden.",lthunstr@uwyo.edu; klaas@uwyo.edu; jramses@uwyo.edu; jonas.nordstrom@nek.lu.se,"Nordström, Jonas/AAR-6623-2020; Nordström, Jonas/E-7708-2015; Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976; Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976; Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X",,,,,13,16,18,2,29,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Alternative models without either bias or with efficient investment fail to match observed return predictability and firm behavior. These results suggest that biases affect firm behavior, which in turn affects return anomalies.","[Alti, Aydogan] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tetlock, Paul C.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Columbia University,"Alti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",aydo-gan.alti@mccombs.utexas.edu; paul.tetlock@columbia.edu,,,,,,,52,45,55,7,76,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

The agent-based model created in this research builds upon two other agent-based models of tax evasion, the Korobow, Johnson, and Axtell (2007) and Hokamp and Pickhardt (2010) models. The model utilizes their rules for taxpayer behavior and apprehension of tax evaders in order to test the effects of network topologies in the propagation of evasive behavior. Findings include that network structures have a significant impact on the dynamics of tax compliance, demonstrating that taxpayers are more likely to declare all their income in networks with higher levels of centrality across the agents, especially when faced with large penalties proportional to their incomes. These results suggest that network structures should be chosen selectively when modeling tax compliance, as different topologies yield different results. Additionally, this research analyzed the special case of a power law distribution and found that targeting highly interconnected individuals resulted in a lower mean gross tax rate than targeting disconnected individuals, due to the penalties inflating the mean gross tax rate in the latter case.

A critical review reveals that many evaluations suffer from small sample sizes, measure impacts only within a year of training, and experience problems with survey attrition and measurement that limit the conclusions one can draw. Over these short time horizons, there are relatively modest effects of training on the survivorship of existing firms. However, there is stronger evidence that training programs help prospective owners launch new businesses more quickly. Most studies find that existing firm owners implement some of the practices taught in training, but the magnitudes of the improvement to practices is often modest. Few studies find significant impacts on profits or sales, although some studies with greater statistical power have done so. There is little evidence to guide policymakers regarding whether any identified effects are due to trained firms drawing sales from competing businesses rather than through productivity improvements or to guide the development of the provision of training at market prices.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the interrelationship between FDI in the real estate sector, economic growth, and property prices while controlling for interest rate and inflation. We use observations from a set of OECD countries for the period between 1995 and 2008. The dynamic interrelationship is analyzed by applying a panel cointegration technique.

Estimates of conditional idiosyncratic volatility and conditional betas obtained from a multifactor REIT-returns model and a bivariate EGARCH model respectively are found to be positively and significantly related with REIT returns. Consistent with Merton's (1987) predictions, we observe that larger REITs post higher average returns when idiosyncratic risk is introduced in cross-sectional regressions. Persistence of past market-risk does not appear to be short-lived and seems to have a lasting impact on future idiosyncratic volatility. We also observe mild evidence of persistence of past idiosyncratic risk, albeit short-lived, thereby suggesting that past idiosyncratic risk has a short-term impact on future idiosyncratic risk.

This paper focuses on exploration of Granger causality relationships among average wheat price of human consumption quality; animal feed quality and the average price of wheat in the world market (source: World Bank). Monthly time series from July 1993 to August 2013 (T= 242) were subjected to stationarity and cointegration tests. Due to nonexistence of equilibrium relationships, the multivariate data were analyzed by Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model in first differences. Separate VAR models were fitted in periods before EU entry and after to verify assumptions of differential short-term dynamic relationships between the prices, as a result of country's accession to EU. Further, orthogonal impulse-response function was prepared to quantify impact of innovation shocks in the source series upon the target series. Differences in relationships were found due to exposure of the Czech market to fluctuations in the world wheat price.

In particular, this study aims to obtain insights into the consumers' intention of purchasing two types of luxury brands: loud (having conspicuous logos and signatures that are not clear or eye-catching) and quiet (having discrete logos and badges that are not clearly embalmed or easily noticeable). A survey questionnaire was administered to 190 participants from different walks of life. The results of data analysis revealed that Malaysian consumers were brand conscious. The findings suggest that the loud luxury buyers intend to impress others by following fashion and new trends, whereas the quiet luxury buyers prefer to feel a sense of accomplishment and social recognition through having finer possessions in life. At the end, the implications for brand managers are discussed, and recommendations for future research are offered. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Keeping-up-with-the-Joneses in relation to domestic benchmark consumption has the effect of magnifying the impact of monetary shocks on the exchange rate.

The consequences of the financial crisis and the implementation of harsh fiscal measures adopted are the shrinking of incomes, the reduction of domestic demand and consumption and the massive increase of unemployment. At the same time, a significant reduction of the productive activity and a decrease in state and enterprise investments took place; all the above in a period when the main challenge is the country's recovery and financial growth. The only way out of the lack of liquidity are EU financial resources, the utilization of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2007-2013 and the resources following the programming period 2014-2020. In this context, despite the relatively high interest they present, private investments in primary sector and in rural areas, are facing significant problems. A research conducted with structured questionnaire to investors enrolled to investment support programmes in rural areas, had as a key goal to depict the potential completion of those investments. From the results of this research it is demonstrated that a significant percentage of approved investments are experiencing severe liquidity problems and in many cases there is a failure to complete them.

Our main findings are as follows. First, by distinguishing between conventional and Islamic stock market indices, we find that these two groups of investments react heterogeneously to the recent political turmoil. Specifically, we document a significant increase in the volatility of Islamic indices during the period of political unrests whereas the uprisings have had little or no significant effect on the volatility in conventional markets. Such difference is confirmed by further analysis in a multivariate GARCH model. Second, regardless of its impact on volatility, there is little evidence to suggest that MENA markets have become more integrated with international markets after the political revolution. Third, similar results are not found for the benchmark indices which indicate that the changes are the result of political tensions. In general, these results are robust to model specification and consistent with the notion that political uncertainty contributes to financial volatility. Overall, the findings are important in understanding the role of political uncertainty on stock market stability and are of great significance to investors and market regulators.

As a consequence, unit-linked life insurance markets around the world are changing. Policyholders have become more aware of investment opportunities outside the insurance sector and they want to enjoy the benefits of investments in different financial instruments in conjunction with mortality protection, so insurers around the world have developed unit-linked products to meet this challenge. According to Romanian legislation which regulates the unit-linked life insurance market, unit-linked life insurance contracts pass most of the investment risk to the policyholder and involve no investment risk for the insurer. Due to the financial instability caused by the Global Crisis and the amplification of market competitiveness, insurers from international markets have started to incorporate guarantees in unit-linked products. Therefore the objective of this study is a proposal of a change in the design of these innovative products in order to respect the Solvency II regulation regarding the management of risk exposure and the policyholders' protection. The authors' purpose is to present a comparative analysis of the main financial instruments that may guarantee the unit-linked insurance contracts in order to create a balance between the insurers' interests and the policyholders' interests. This research proposes some legislative changes in the Romanian legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance market that may authorize the Romanian insurers to offer unit-linked contracts with and without investment guarantees.","[Ciumas, Cristina; Chis, Diana-Maria; Coca, Ramona Alexandrina] Univ Babes Bolyai, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,,cristina.ciumas@econ.ubbcluj.ro; dianamaria.chis@yahoo.com; ramona.coca@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Chis, Diana Maria/HKO-9193-2023",,,,,,7,0,0,0,6,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-021-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,79,84,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB8JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346752000010,0

A tendency to overestimate of tax rate changes is enhanced when the tax rate is presented as the first information (framing effect). Respondents are not guided by rational tax decisions attaching a higher importance to the first information given, which could explain the differences between predicted and observed levels of tax perception.

City beautification was the fundamental purpose of urban design at the time it was introduced as a separate profession. Over time, the scope and objectives of the urban design have changed. Today Urban design plays a key role in the creation of sustainable communities in terms of the triple bottom line, that is the three dimensions of life economic, e.g.well-paid jobs, social e.g. good schools and sports facilities and environmental e.g. clear air, clean rivers, beautiful places to live, work and play. So today urban design seeks to enhance the life of the city and its inhabitants in socioeconomic & environmental terms. However the current approach to urban design is mainly top down, i.e., generally the architects or the planners design the urban environment and at the implementation stage the community may have some involvement. There are serious criticisms of this approach as it may not touch the ground community level and therefore there is a serious risk these projects will fail to create sustainable environments. The criticism is that the experts in development simply comply with requirements of funding agencies in the development and this top down process may alienate local community members and fail to capture locally significant factors. Through a reexamination of the literature on this topic this paper argues that a proper bottom up approach will help to achieve better performance against the sustainability indicators. It also explores the strengths and weaknesses in the classic top down approach to urban development which provides early high level planning solutions, whereas although a bottom-up approach can make more sense because the professionals have a strong base of understanding of the place with the help of effective participation from the concerned stakeholders it takes more time and commitment from all parties involved.

The material aspirations could be analyzed on two dimensions: a) fundamental needs, essential for survival, which are universal and have an internal source and b) material needs that reflect the social circumstances in which people live in. The public opinion perspective on material needs is as legitimate as the welfare experts' one. How do Romanians see the essential material needs for their life? What is the extent and which are the dimensions of material deprivation (poverty) in Romanian society? For measuring social needs, we used a 21-item composite scale in a survey carried out in June 2013, featuring a representative sample for Romania's adult population. We observed a large consensus in the Romanian society in viewing certain needs as living standards. Material deprivation is multi-dimensional, affecting variable segments of the population. The most important factors accounting for the variance in material deprivation are income, labour market participation, education and medium of residence. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The ideology and political partisanship of the ruling government may be crucial in determining the prevailing course of action. In good times, conservative parties are typically pro-reform. However, do these parties try to exploit periods of crisis to carry out their reforms? Do social-democratic parties support even greater social protection? To answer these questions, this paper uses indicators of structural reforms in the labor, product, and financial markets for 25 OECD countries over the 1975-2008 period. The empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of crises: product markets are liberalized, but financial markets become more regulated. Partisan politics also matters, as right parties are associated with more pro-market reforms. Yet, crises modify partisan politics: right-wing parties refrain from promoting privatizations, and oppose the introduction of greater financial market regulations. By contrast, center parties liberalize and trim unemployment benefits generosity, while left parties privatize. Furthermore, weak, fractionalized governments, which are associated with more regulated product markets, are also more likely to liberalize during a crisis.","[Galasso, Vincenzo] Univ Svizzera Italiana, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Galasso, Vincenzo] CEPR, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Galasso, V (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Via Buffi 13, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.",vincenzo.galasso@usi.ch,"Galasso, Vincenzo/AFP-4222-2022","Galasso, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3882-0587",,,,,53,31,34,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2014,158.0,1-2,,,,,143,165,,10.1007/s11127-012-9956-6,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AA3FZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000330979600013,0

Although different TOD typologies have been developed in different contexts, they are based on subjective evaluation criteria derived from the context in which they are built and typically lack a validation measure. Arguably there exist sets of TOO characteristics that perform better in certain contexts, and being able to optimise TOD effectiveness would facilitate planning and supporting policy development. This research utilises data from census collection districts (CCDs) in Brisbane with different sets of TOD attributes measured across six objectively quantified built environmental indicators: net employment density, net residential density, land use diversity, intersection density, cul-de-sac density, and public transport accessibility. Using these measures, a Two Step Cluster Analysis was conducted to identify natural groupings of the CCDs with similar profiles, resulting in four unique TOD clusters: (a) residential TODs, (b) activity centre TODs, (c) potential TODs, and (d) TOD non-suitability. The typologies are validated by estimating a multinomial logistic regression model in order to understand the mode choice behaviour of 10,013 individuals living in these areas. Results indicate that in comparison to people living in areas classified as residential TODs, people who reside in non-TOD clusters were significantly less likely to use public transport (PT) (1.4 times), and active transport (4 times) compared to the car. People living in areas classified as potential TODs were 1.3 times less likely to use PT, and 2.5 times less likely to use active transport compared to using the car. Only a little difference in mode choice behaviour was evident between people living in areas classified as residential TODs and activity centre TODs. The results suggest that: (a) two types of TODs may be suitable for classification and effect mode choice in Brisbane; (b) TOD typology should be developed based on their TOD profile and performance matrices; (c) both bus stop and train station based TODs are suitable for development in Brisbane.

Christchurch has been subjected to over 13,000 earthquakes since September 10th 2010, and in particular the destruction and devastation that resulted from the February 22nd 2011 earthquake. However, key learnings from the Christchurch post-disaster experiences do not appear to have been heeded with the publication, in 2013, of the 30 year Auckland Plan and the Unitary Plan for Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, where almost half of New Zealand's population live. Compare this with just 400,000 who lived in Christchurch in 2010/11. Therefore the consequences of a similar scale disaster would be catastrophic for Auckland and New Zealand. The paper reviews the short-comings of the Auckland Plan and Unitary Plans with regard to 'disaster preparedness and response', based on those Christchurch lessons, but also in respect of the 'Resilient Cities Framework' (RCF). Therefore the question is posed as to whether we are really listening or learning, or not? The conclusion is, that tragically we are not, and whilst we can plan and write up 'lessons learned', the only apparent lesson to be learned is that we do not learn from the 'lessons learned'.

Design/methodology/approach - Since the countries under investigation are connected to the European Union (EU) or the Eurozone and the economic interdependence among them is evolving, we carried out our analysis using the VECMX* framework. Findings - Our results indicate that the transition economies in our sample react in a similar manner to changes in international macroeconomic policies. Cyprus and Greece react also in a similar way, but these responses are very small in magnitude. Finally, Turkey behaves in a different way, probably due to the inflationary pressures in its economy. In general, there is evidence of linkages and interdependence among the EU or Eurozone members of the region. Research limitations/implications - We did not construct a full structural model proposed by economic theory, but instead we estimated a reduced-form model. Data limitation is one reason. The other reason is that our sample countries are extremely heterogeneous. Also, for most of the sample countries there is an acute problem of structural uncertainty of their economies yet. Practical implications - The way that the economies under investigation react to changes in international macroeconomic policies, may influence the Eurozone policy makers regarding the implemented monetary policy. Originality/value - To our knowledge, the above methodology is implemented for the first time in the sample countries and provides a detailed investigation regarding their economic policies and the effects of the Eurozone policies.","[Koukouritakis, Minoas; Papadopoulos, Athanasios P.; Yannopoulos, Andreas] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Greece",University of Crete,"Koukouritakis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon, Greece.",m.koukouritakis@uoc.gr,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78350-756-6; 978-1-78350-755-9,INT SYMP EC,,,2014,23.0,,,,,,185,216,,10.1108/S1571-038620140000023007,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358526100007,0

This approach does not seem to capture well the properties of viral videos which are shared with no regard whether the sender has adopted the product. This paper presents the first model of such knowledge diffusion. The model consists of an artificial social network (a mix of small world and power network) that mimics the properties of empirical social networks and a model of node activation where every node that viewed the viral video shares it with a random subset of her neighbors just once. The results of the simulation show that there is a phase transition: in one phase, almost no agents view the viral video, in the other one, a great part of the whole population does. When the second phase occurs, the diffusion of the knowledge in time resembles that of Bass model. What phase occurs and how many agents view the content depend above all on how catchy the video is. Other marketing practices as selecting the seed of the first addressed agents are of secondary importance. The marketer can choose between addressing fewer more connected agents or more agents with fewer connections. If the video is catchy, then a small number of the first addressed agents is sufficient even when the agents are selected randomly.

The financial crisis started in 2007 has highlighted the growing importance of the 'shadow banking system'. China's mounting shadow banking system has been weakening monetary policy and has acted as a substitute for financing within the formal financial system. Any major fluctuation in the Chinese shadow banking system can send shock waves through the financial markets of emerging economies that would affect the entire global financial sector. The aim of this paper is to assess the proportion in which a major default in the Chinese shadow banking system could affect the world's financial markets in the same manner that the financial bubble created after Lehman Brothers in the US in 2007 lead to the world's financial crisis. Even though China's shadow banking system and the US shadow banking systems differ widely in many aspects we consider that a comparison is diligent in providing the findings of the paper. As research methodology we use the qualitative approach by investigating the case of shadow banking system in Chinese economy.

However, these problems can be reduced if the transport of palletized goods is shifted to inland waterways. By doing so, the goods are bundled for the main haulage by barge. In order to reduce the transport distances by truck to an absolute minimum, a possible last-mile distribution would have to be organized via a limited number of directly canal-served hubs. The locations of those hubs are crucial for the feasibility of modal shift. This study advances the transport geography literature by elaborating a location analysis model specifically for palletized goods. This model determines the optimal hub location by taking into account the large variation of origins and destinations of transport flows, while the introduction of a cost structure enables potential economic gains (cost savings) and reductions in CO2 emissions to be calculated. The analysis is performed for transport data on palletized building materials in Belgium. Two concepts were defined, which resulted in an optimal intermodal network of 9 hubs and one with 27 hubs; through the implementation of these networks, respectively 26% and 38% of the transport flows can be shifted to the inland waterways at a profitable cost. It can be expected that over time these percentages will increase further. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, brand experiences are gaining most of the attention in the eyes of marketers but there is still scarcity in empirical study. This study excavates consumer's experience and reveals consumer's emotion on national car brand consumption. The focus group is targeted on Proton and Perodua young urban adult car users between 18-35 years old with a minimum of one year car usage. The session encouraged respondents to freely speak in order to explore their emotions on their selected national car model. The moderator conducted two sessions that comprise ten panels, thus a total of twenty panels participated. The discussions were concluded whereby Malaysian respondents have difficulties in expressing their true emotions describing their experience of each car model. Respondents tend to comment more on the quality of product attribute compared to addressing their emotional experience. Results have shown that if consumers were given the opportunity to choose, they will switch to foreign car brand that has better quality. This study has been seen as series of attempts to understand the emotion of consumers with regards to their brand experience.

Our findings suggest that the medium effect is stronger when a medium is more numerous. Also, a more cognitively complex medium makes the mediums more effective. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Accordingly, the tax system is based on the principles of fairness and equality, therefore taxation should be the least property limitation. Tax on personal income is the instrument of tax policy that with its inevitable fiscal objective has a much more important objective of a social nature-alleviate regressivity of VAT Most financial scholars, lawyers or economists, agree that the principle of fairness is tried to be put into practice just by applying progressive tax rates on income. In some counties of Eastern Europe though, a flat personal income tax system has been introduced, also in order to increase the level of fairness. Thus this paper analyses personal income tax system, by focusing on the different types of income, tax base, tax rates and tax credits. The other issue of taxation that is scrutinized is the formation of an optimal tax burden, which means a continuous balance searching.

The new Basel III aims to strengthen the banking system stability by applying stringent standards designed to improve the capacity to absorb shocks from the economic and financial sectors, as well as reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. The new standards have to improve risk management, increase transparency and disclosure requirements for credit institutions and to solve problems of systemic importance.

At the empirical level, knowing the causes of crises appearance is less motivated (justified), as is impossible to predict when the crisis will appear, which will be the causes, in which areas will it appear and which consequences it will bring. Of course, one of the main solutions is the ability of governing bodies to develop strategies of overcoming the crisis and to implement more efficient solutions to the detriment of negative consequences. From the results known so far about overcoming the recent crisis, none of the causes that provoked it was not removed, which leas us to say with certainty that the banking system will support some significant changes in order to overcome the possibility of appearance of a new systemic crisis.

The paper discusses and examines trust development in relation to communication within work relationships and more specifically deterioration of trust and trust breach. The paper examines the role of communication in trust building, violation, breaches and restoration in inter-personal relationships to provide insights and implications for further research as well as practice for developing intellectual capital. By presenting the empirical findings from a qualitative case study and other data the paper aims to shed more light on the issue of distrust and how poor communication affects trust development between actors involved. The paper advocates the importance of developing trust and communication for intangible intellectual asset in workplaces and their management. Originality of the paper is based on the idea of exploring the relation between trust and communication, specifically in the situation of trust violation and breach. The paper provides a still under researched view into the development of intellectual capital, since trust and communication as intangible resources have not been widely examined in the context of trust breach, in specific. Implications are made to leadership and development of human intellectual capital. In the theoretical discussion, trust and communication are seen interwoven in interpersonal work relationships. Trust is looked as an intangible asset and skill and communication a means and antecedent for trust. The findings show that poor communication plays a role in loosing trust and trust breaches. It is notable that distrust may permeate widely within the organization and beyond the original parties involved. If space is left to the low trust climate to develop the consequences may be unfavorable, harmful and even damaging to the organization. Based on the findings, trust violation and breach seems to be connected with workplace bullying and the solution for trust breaches may be quitting the work and move away from the place.","[Savolainen, Taina; Ikonen, Mirjami] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Business, Espoo, Finland; [Lopez-Fresno, Palmira] Spanish Assoc Qual, Madrid, Spain",University of Eastern Finland,"Savolainen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Business, Espoo, Finland.",taina.savolainen@uef.fi; correo@palmiralopezfresno.com; mirjami.ikonen@uef.fi,"Ikonen, Mirjami/ABD-4124-2020","Ikonen, Mirjami/0000-0002-9915-0927",,,,,37,0,2,1,15,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-24-1,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2014,,,,,,,190,198,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC3EP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351573000024,0

The Irish National Farm Survey data and Irish weather data were the main datasets used in this study. A set of simulation models were used to determine grass yields and field time under a baseline scenario and a future climate scenario. An optimising farm level model which maximises farm net income under limiting farm resources was then run under these scenarios. Changes in farm net incomes under the climate change scenario compared to the baseline scenario were taken as a measure to determine the effect of climate change on farms. Any changes in farm activities under the climate run compared to the baseline run were considered as farm's responses to maximise farm profits. The results showed that there was a substantial increase in yields of grass (49% to 56%) in all regions. The impact of climate change on farms was different based on the regions. Dairy farms in the Border, Midlands and South East regions suffered whereas dairy farms in other regions generally fared better under the climate change scenario. For a majority of farms, a substitution of concentrate feed with grass based feeds and increasing stocking rate were identified as the most common farm responses. However, farms replaced concentrate feed at varying degree. Dairy farms in the Mid East showed a move towards beef production system where medium dairy farms in the South East regions shifted entire tillage land to grass land. Farms in the South East region also kept animals on grass longer under the climate change scenario compared to the baseline scenario.","[Shrestha, Shailesh] SRUC, Scotlands Rural Coll, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hennessy, Thia] TEAGASCUS, REDP, Galway, Ireland; [Abdalla, Mohamed; Jones, Michael B.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Abdalla, Mohamed] Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB9 1FX, Scotland",Scotland's Rural College; Trinity College Dublin; University of Aberdeen,"Shrestha, S (通讯作者)，SRUC, Land Econ Environm & Soc, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",Shailesh.Shrestha@sruc.ac.uk,"FORRISTAL, PATRICK/AAN-2910-2021; Shrestha, Shailesh/J-5366-2019","FORRISTAL, PATRICK/0000-0003-0351-4616; Shrestha, Shailesh/0000-0001-6053-0212; Abdalla, Mohamed/0000-0001-8403-327X; Hennessy, Thia/0000-0002-6137-1249","Department of Agriculture and Food, Ireland [06/316]","Department of Agriculture and Food, Ireland","The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Agriculture and Food, Ireland for providing funding for this study under the Research Stimulus Fund Programme, Project No. 06/316.",,61,7,7,1,13,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Contrary to the popular belief that rural households in developing countries generally own large herds of livestock for social reasons, communal livestock farmers in the study area who kept livestock for social reasons were found to own smaller herd sizes of cattle. This particular finding indicates that economic reasons for livestock ownership are more important than social reasons among smallholder livestock farmers in this study area. Access to markets and the ability to sell cattle were found to be the strongest influencing factors compared to socio-economic attributes such as marital status, social grants and off-farm employment. Losses due to theft and death were associated significantly with herd size. Recommended policy interventions aimed at increasing the herd size and income of smallholder livestock farmers include government introducing appropriate livestock subsidy programmes that could potentially assist farmers in expanding their herds, investments in efficient protection against wildlife intrusion from game parks, the establishment of well-functioning markets, improved access to roads and market information, and investments in farmers' education to create awareness of new innovations and practices in breeding and veterinary services.","[Sikhweni, N.

A gravity model of trade is employed to investigate how various freedom indices assembled by the Fraser Institute impact the volume of trade, exports, and imports. The main findings of the article are that each of the freedom indices impact heterogeneously across the measure of trade flows, with the changes in Regulation having the biggest impact on trade. All combinations of freedom are used to find the mixture of freedom which yields the largest trade gains. The largest gains from trade generally combine Business Regulation in a variety of different configurations. The smallest gains, or losses, to trade arise with augmented monetary independence.

Within the framework of a three-stage-budgeting approach, more disaggregated demand reactions for milk products and types of meat are estimated. Conformable with demand theory, price reactions are found to be less elastic the more aggregated the product groups are. Generally, demand for pork and beef turns out fairly price-elastic. Similarly, price reactions for cheese and milk are stronger than average estimates for European markets. Substitution patterns are more distinct than those found in a comparable study for Germany. In addition, our study indicates the importance of modeling a comprehensive budgeting process rather than isolated levels of product aggregation when deriving both price and expenditure elasticities of demand.","[Widenhorn, Andreas; Salhofer, Klaus] Tech Univ Munich, Environm Econ & Agr Policy Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Salhofer, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Environm Econ & Agr Policy Grp, Alte Akad 14, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",klaus.salhofer@tum.de,"Salhofer, Klaus/ACN-4362-2022","Salhofer, Klaus/0000-0002-4119-648X",,,,,53,1,1,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Empirical results suggest substantial asymmetries (nonlinearities) in all lending rates. More specifically, banks adjust their lending rates faster in response to increases in negative discrepancies from the long-run equilibrium arising from an increase in the money market rate, while they act slowly following money market rate decreases. Furthermore, the degree of reluctance of banks to follow money market rate decreases appears to vary across lending rates, suggesting the existence of sectoral heterogeneities besides asymmetries.","Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Yildirim, D (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey.",dilem@metu.edu.tr,"YILDIRIM, Dilem/ABA-1256-2020",,,,,,40,3,3,0,12,BILGESEL YAYINCILIK SAN & TIC LTD,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH NO 6-1, ATA APT, CANKAYA, ANKARA 06550, TURKEY",1300-610X,1308-4658,,IKTISAT ISLET FINANS,Iktisat Islet.

The model is implemented using an AR (p)-GARCH (1, 1)-t model for the marginal distributions and constant and time-varying copulas for the joint distribution. The results show that the dependence between crude oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock market returns is generally weak, that it was positive before the global financial crisis, except in Hong Kong, and that it increased significantly in the aftermath of the crisis. The lower tail dependence between oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock markets exceeds that of the upper tail dependence, except in Japan and Singapore in the post-crisis period. Moreover, we show that time-varying copulas best capture the tail dependence and that taking the tail correlation into account leads to improved accuracy of VaR estimates. These findings have important implications for investors interested in Asia-Pacific markets for portfolio diversification, risk management, and international asset allocation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Barron and Erev (2003) and Hertwig, Barron, Weber and Erev (2004) argue that such findings are substantive and call for a theory of decision making under risk other than Prospect Theory for decisions from experience. Fox and Hadar (2006) suggest that the discrepancy is due to sampling error: people are likely to sample rare events less often than objective probability implies, especially if their samples are small. A strand of papers has responded examining the necessity of sample error in the underweighting of rare events. The current paper extends the results of such contributions and further strengthens the evidence on underweighting. The first experiment shows that the discrepancy persists even when people sample the entire population of outcomes and make a decision under risk rather than under uncertainty. A reanalysis of Barron and Erev (2003) further reveals that the gap persists even when subjects observe the expected frequency of rare events. The second experiment shows that the gap exists in a repeated decision making paradigm that controls for sample biases and the hot stove effect. Moreover, while underweighting persists in actual choices, overweighting is observed in judged probabilities. The results of the two experiments strengthen the suggestion that descriptive theories of choice that assume overweighting of small probabilities are not useful in describing decisions from experience. This is true even when there is no sample error, for both decisions under risk and for repeated choices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The study takes an empirical perspective focusing on bank lending. We compare the lending responses across government owned and private banks to financial crises using the balance sheet information of 764 major banks headquartered in 50 countries over the period of 1994-2009. Using a nested panel regression framework that allows for parameter shifts in the bank lending equation, we find robust evidence that government owned banks increase their lending during crises relative to normal times, while private banks' lending decreases. Government-owned banks thus counteract the lending slowdown of private banks. The findings suggest that governments can play an active counter-cyclical role in their banking systems directly through government-owned banks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

In the absence of flexibility in risk pricing through interest rates and strong contract enforcement in China, we find that lenders reduce collateral requirements from more conservative borrowers and that this negative relation is significantly moderated by borrowers' poor credit quality and low asset tangibility. Our finding that conservatism can result in a tangible benefit in the form of lower collateral requirements indicates that lenders value financial reporting conservatism. However, the benefit from financial reporting conservatism is muted as lenders become more concerned about borrowers' default risk or ability to pledge tangible assets as collateral against loans.

Moreover, in the period prior to the recent Great Recession credit risk plays no role in explaining CDS price changes. The dominance of liquidity effects casts serious doubts on the relevance of CDS price changes as an indicator of default risk dynamics. Our results show how multiple liquidity factors including firm specific and aggregate liquidity proxies as well as an asymmetric information measure are critical determinants of CDS price variations. In particular, the impact of informed traders on the CDS price increases when markets are characterised by higher uncertainty, which supports concerns of insider trading during the crisis.

We define contagion as excess correlation, i.e. correlation between banks and sovereigns over and above what is explained by common factors, using CDS spreads at the bank and at the sovereign level. Moreover, we investigate the determinants of contagion by analyzing bank-specific as well as country-specific variables and their interaction. Using the EBA's disclosure of sovereign exposures of banks, we provide empirical evidence that three contagion channels are at work: a guarantee channel, an asset holdings channel and a collateral channel. We find that banks with a weak capital buffer, a weak funding structure and less traditional banking activities are particularly vulnerable to risk spillovers. At the country level, the debt ratio is the most important driver of contagion. Furthermore, the impact of government interventions on contagion depends on the type of intervention, with outright capital injections being the most effective measure in reducing spillover intensity.

We additionally consider the implications of allowing for health-state dependence in the utility function on the estimates of risk aversion and examine how the marginal utility of income changes in poor health states. Our estimates of relative risk aversion with cross-section data vary closely around 1, which corresponds to logarithmic utility, while the estimates with panel data are slightly larger. We find that controlling for health dependence generally reduces these estimates.

An inference is that, in Russian regions with high corruption and with autocratic government, foreign direct investment appears driven by the personal interests of controlling regional political elites who collaborate for mutual gain with foreign investors from corrupt and autocratic countries.

Using Pearl River Delta (PRD) as the study case, we review the planning and funding processes for an inter-city passenger rail services, and reveal how a new funding and planning framework has been developed out of pre-existing organizational and legal constraints.

Using banks' political and regulatory connections as instruments, this paper finds that TARP investments increased bank loan supply by an annualized rate of 6.36% for banks with below median Tier 1 capital ratios. This increase is found in all major types of loans and can be translated into $404 billion of additional loans for all TARP banks. On average, TARP banks employed about one-third of their TARP capital to support new loans and kept the rest to strengthen their balance sheets. Furthermore, there is little evidence that loans made by TARP banks had lower quality than those by non-TARP banks. In sum, this paper shows a positive stimulus effect of TARP on credit supply during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This decline has been associated with the level to which jobs are codifiable. There is evidence that codifiable tasks are more prone to technological substitution and outsourcing compared with tacit tasks. This article empirically investigates two crucial aspects of the decline in codified jobs. First, it studies what happened to workers in codified occupations in terms of unemployment, occupational change, and wages. Second, it revisits the hypothesis that code-based technologies are the major driver of this labor market shift. We find that job codification is associated with both higher unemployment and higher occupational change. It is also associated with wage losses for workers who left routinized jobs. We find, however, little evidence that code-based technologies were the driving factor behind these dynamics.","Univ Jena, DFG RTG Econ Innovat Change 1411, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Nedelkoska, L (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, DFG RTG Econ Innovat Change 1411, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",ljubica.nedelkoska@uni-jena.de,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1326365] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,34,3,4,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In our model, the spread determinants' magnitude is conditional on an unobservable endogenous sovereign credit cycle as represented by the underlying state of a Markov regime switching process. Our explanatory variables are motivated in the tradition of structural credit risk models and include changes in asset prices, interest rates, implied market volatility, gold price changes and foreign exchange rates. We examine daily frequency variations of U.S. dollar denominated Eurobond credit spreads of four major Latin American sovereign bond issuers (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) with liquid bond markets during March 2000 to June 2011. We find that spread determinants are statistically significant and consistent with theory, while their magnitude remarkably varies with the state of the credit cycle. Crisis states are characterized by high spread change uncertainty and high sensitivities with respect to the spread change determinants. We further document that not only changes of local currencies, but also changes of the Euro with respect to the U.S. dollar are significant spread drivers and argue that this is consistent with the sovereigns' ability to pay.

Using data from 12 European countries, our findings suggest that religion has a significant effect on the share price of companies whose activities are considered unethical, i.e., tobacco manufacturers and alcohol producers. The share price of these companies (called sin stocks) is depressed when they are located in a predominantly Protestant environment (relative to a Catholic environment). With investors in Protestant countries being more sin averse than in Catholic countries, they insist upon higher expected returns on sin stocks. Conversely, religious preferences do not have the same impact on the performance of other companies, e.g. socially responsible companies. Our results are robust to various methodologies and controlling for several firm-specific, industry-specific and country-specific characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Hedging trading exerts a negative impact, regardless of its size, on price discovery in futures markets. Hedgers are less likely to be information motivated, so their trading uniformly delays the price discovery process. However, there is a positive and nonlinear impact of speculators' trade size on price discovery, the contribution of which depends on the relative size of the speculative open interest. Contrary to conventional wisdom among regulators, speculative trading does not harm the market in terms of market efficiency; as long as the percentage of speculators' open interest is below an endogenously determined threshold (approximately 20% for EUR-USD and 16.3% for JPY-USD), speculative trading even improves futures market efficiency.

Furthermore, there is evidence of positive spatial interactions across municipalities.","[Hansen, Winslow D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Naughton, Helen T.] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Hansen, WD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Hansen, Winslow/0000-0003-3868-9416",,,,,73,7,7,1,46,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 728 State Street, Suite 443, MADISON, WI, UNITED STATES",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,NOV,2013,89.0,4,,,,,699,721,,10.3368/le.89.4.699,0.0,,,23,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245QP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000326479200007,0

A model with heterogeneous, infinitely lived households and competitive housing and mortgage markets is constructed to evaluate this question. Households can default on their mortgages via foreclosure. The bailout guarantee is a tax-financed mortgage interest rate subsidy. Eliminating this subsidy leads to a large decline in mortgage origination and increases aggregate welfare by 0.5% in consumption equivalent variation, but has little effect on foreclosure rates and housing investment. The interest rate subsidy is a regressive policy: it hurts low-income and low-asset households. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Turkey's entry into a customs union with the European Union and a World Bank-imposed policy measure adopted during the 2001 economic crisis have greatly facilitated the process of market intensification in Turkish agriculture. There are two sides to this process: one concerns the historical centrality of small-scale production directed towards local-regional consumers; the other relates to the dominant role played by supermarkets in changing the conditions of subsistence. The restructuring of wholesale markets and the privatization of formerly state-led agricultural co-operatives and producers' unions have been crucial for the expansion of supermarkets into agri-food relationships. The competitive growth of Islamically oriented small and medium-sized capital groups alongside large retailers is further deepening the commodification process in food relationships.,"Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Atasoy, Y (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",yatasoy@sfu.ca,,,,,,,93,21,24,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

They also realize positive long-term stock returns, suggesting that the market does not fully value the benefits of CSR immediately. In addition, we find that mergers by high CSR acquirers take less time to complete and are less likely to fail than mergers by low CSR acquirers.

This paper studies the evolution of trading strategies for a hypothetical trader who chooses portfolios from foreign exchange (forex) technical rules in major and emerging markets, the carry trade, and US equities. The results show that a backtesting procedure to choose optimal portfolios improves upon the performance of nonadaptive rules. We also find that forex trading alone dramatically outperforms the S&P 500, with much larger Sharpe ratios over the whole sample, but there is little gain to coordinating forex and equity strategies, which explains why practitioners consider these tools separately. Forex trading returns dip significantly in the 1990s but recover by the end of the decade and have been markedly superior to an equity position since 1998. Overall, trading rule returns still exist in forex markets-with substantial stability in the types of rules-though they have migrated to emerging markets to a considerable degree.

We identify which of the variables are direct determinants of property rights protection and which are not, and subject the outcomes to a battery of robustness tests. We find that ethnic fractionalization is the dominant institutional predictor of property rights protection across the world.

Three fiscal policy regimes are distinguished. Our key findings are the following. First, plans are on average unbiased, although they are overoptimistic during earlier parts of our sample and overly pessimistic during the later parts of our sample, when revenues are under-projected. Second, general economic conditions and the state of the public finances are important determinants of both plans and their implementation. Third, this is also the case for political and institutional factors. Expenditure overruns are partly related to political factors, whereas cautious revenue forecasts relate to the institutional setting.

Following a suggestion by Marshall (1920), we entertain the possibility that people derive utility not only from consumption, but also from the very act of saving. These saving-based preferences are related to models of habit formation and the spirit of capitalism, but incorporate the feature that people have anticipatory habits because they care about the future accumulation of wealth. We derive the Euler equations for these preferences and estimate them with GMM. Our estimates suggest that the preference for saving is economically significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This article demonstrates new techniques for joint analysis of the physical and risk-neutral models using data from both the underlying asset and options. While much of the prior work in this area has focused on affine and affine-jump models because of their analytical tractability, the techniques used in this article are straightforward to apply to a broad class of models of potential interest. The techniques are based on evaluating various integrals of interest using Monte Carlo sums over simulated volatility paths.

However, this conclusion has not been widely accepted because of the empirical challenges associated with identifying the relationship amid the dramatic and complicated changes in the household economic environment during the Great Recession and subsequent slow recovery. Leverage may indirectly influence spending by increasing borrowing constraints, impeding refinancing, and raising the likelihood that a household will face future borrowing constraints. Leverage may directly influence spending simply by making some households uncomfortable with their leverage compared with some behavioral benchmark. The authors use the 2007-09 Survey of Consumer Finances panel to explore these issues. They find that highly leveraged households were more likely to report cutting back their spending in 2009, even after controlling for other factors expected to influence spending, such as changes in income and wealth. In analyzing that relationship, the authors find evidence that leverage influenced household spending through several channels.","[Dynan, Karen] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Dynan, K (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,"Dynan, Karen/0000-0001-5504-4025",Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Washington University in St. Louis,Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Washington University in St. Louis,"Karen Dynan is the Robert S.

However, stylized facts such as clustered extremes and serial dependence typically violate the assumption of independence. This has been the main motivation to propose an approach that is able to overcome these difficulties by considering the time between extreme events as a stochastic process. One of the advantages of the method consists in its capability to capture the short-term behavior of extremes without involving an arbitrary stochastic volatility model or a prefiltration of the data, which would certainly affect the estimate. We make use of the proposed model to obtain an improved estimate for the value at risk (VaR). The model is then compared to various competing approaches such as Engle and Marianelli's CAViaR and the GARCH-EVT model. Finally, we present a comparative empirical illustration with transaction data from Bayer AG, a typical blue chip stock from the German stock market index DAX, the DAX index itself and a hypothetical portfolio of international equity indexes already used by other authors.

The paper analyzes how TBT influences the trade probability, trade volume and trade duration. The trade volume is further decomposed into the number of products traded (extensive margin) and the trade value of each product (intensive margin). It is found that TBT imposes inconsistent impacts on the different components of trade, and that the effects differ by country. First, TBT reduces trade probability, but increases the volume and duration of existing trade relationships. Second, the positive effect of TBT on trade volume is mainly driven by an increase in the extensive margin, and the effect on the intensive margin is not statistically significant. Finally, TBT raised by developed countries have a stronger negative impact on trade probability, while TBT implemented by developing countries have a greater positive effect on trade volume.","[Bao, Xiaohua; Chen, Wei-Chih] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, WC (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wei.chihchen@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"Chen, Wei-Chih/AGN-5533-2022","Chen, Wei-Chih/0000-0002-3333-4555",,,,,33,24,27,6,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

First, we discuss the major point raised by Stark and Lukasz (Review of Development Economics 17, no. 1 (2013):156-62), i.e. the fact that a framework which explicitly considers asymmetric information is correct and would imply a reversal of our finding. Although, we acknowledge that the mechanism highlighted by the authors is an alternative explanation to return decisions, we argue that the suggested framework is unsuitable in the specific context analyzed in our paper (as well as most real-world situations). Instead, the assumptions underlying our simple theoretical model are strictly linked to data availability in order to perform a sensible empirical analysis. Second, we present a slightly different version of the model proposed in the original article that overcomes possible inconsistencies on the saving behavior of the migrants. Although all the computations are shown in one of the articles cited in our published paper, we now prefer to show them fully in this issue of the Review. The conclusions of our theoretical model do not change.

External fraud is an important operational risk faced by insurers. In this research, we analyze the empirical relationship between insurance fraud and the business cycle and we concentrate our study on two insurance contracts that may create an incentive to defraud. We find that residual insurance fraud exists both in the contract with replacement cost endorsement and the contract with no-deductible endorsement in the Taiwan automobile theft insurance market. These results are consistent with previous literature on the relationship between fraud activity and non-optimal insurance contracting. We also show that the severity of insurance fraud is countercyclical. Fraud is stimulated during periods of recession and mitigated during periods of expansion.

The discriminatory power of the estimated models is analyzed by several accuracy indicators. The inclusion of time-dependent macroeconomic variables in addition to covariates representing characteristics of the contract and individuals improved the overall performance. Logistic regression showed a higher discriminatory power than Cox proportional. hazards model according to all accuracy indicators. It is worth mentioning the negative relationship between the probability of default and the economy base interest rate. Decreases in the base interest rate lead banks to lose revenue from treasury operations and expand credit operations to compensate the loss. This strategy brings individuals with a higher probability of default to the financial market. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although there are potential efficiency gains from its application, we argue that the SCC may be inappropriate for use in CBA for three reasons. First, as currently calculated, the SCC typically excludes the potential for catastrophes and certain types of climate damages, and assumes perfect substitutability between natural and human capital. For these reasons, it is likely to be biased downwards, and as such would provide misleading advice to policy-makers. Second, the SCC is a global measure of benefits, whereas standard practice in CBA is to include only domestic costs and benefits. Accounting for costs borne outside of Canada and along only one dimension (carbon damage) risks reducing economic efficiency and confusing the users of CBA studies. Third, SCC-based decision-making is unlikely to be consistent with Canadian commitments to international partners on emissions reductions; so its adoption risks institutionalizing non-delivery of those commitments.","[Heyes, Anthony; Morgan, Dylan] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa,"Heyes, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,"Heyes, Anthony/0000-0003-1847-9374",,,,,26,5,5,2,20,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

However, the current level and rates of growth in both consumption and population vary systematically among countries grouped according to income levels. Many high income countries have population growth rates at close to replacement levels, but their per capita consumption is consistently several times higher than low income countries. Low income countries need to grow out of poverty and have high population growth rates. Using current population structures for India and the USA in an age-structured demographic model, and simple projections of annual reductions in fertility or consumption per capita over the next 50 years, we show that while reductions in both consumption and fertility are necessary to stabilize impacts, there are short term gains from consumption reductions in high income countries such as the USA, and long term gains from early fertility reductions in growing economies such as India.","[Mace, Georgina M.] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Terama, Emma] UCL, Dept Sci Technol Engn & Publ Policy, Ctr Engn Policy, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Coulson, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University of Oxford,"Mace, GM (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",g.mace@ucl.ac.uk,"Coulson, Tim/AAL-8148-2021; Mace, Georgina M/I-3072-2016","Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003; Mace, Georgina M/0000-0001-8965-5211; Terama, Emma/0000-0003-1790-2126",,,,,41,3,5,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Wald coefficient tests indicate shocks in prior day returns manifest less systemic return-risk under the short-selling ban, thus coinciding with the regulatory intentions of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to moderate the sudden and excessive fluctuations in securities prices. The findings also agree with prior work in observing abnormal-negative returns for heavily shorted firms, and diminished negative skewness and kurtosis under binding short-selling constraints.

The choice of mode of transport to work was investigated using a conditional logit regression model; the purpose was to determine individual and alternative specific variables that influence mode choice for trips to work. The results from the estimated model indicate that individual characteristics such as family size, educational status, income, home-to-work distance and marital status are significant determinants of the choice of commute mode by government employees. Furthermore, the results indicate that government 'workers are less likely to choose transport modes with longer travel times. It was also found that about 75% of the workers using public transport and that 19% of those using personal means of transport were prepared to shift to an institutionally arranged large bus services. It was therefore recommended that government institutions in the metropolis as a policy provide large buses to convey employees to and from work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that getting one additional answer right in the pension literacy survey (out of six) generates approximately a 50% additional chance that the individual will save at least in one of the surveyed periods, and a 25% additional chance that the individual will save in both surveyed periods. We also test for evidence that pension literacy affects worker choices regarding their pension savings (what we call active financial behavior). We find that more literate workers are more likely to engage in pension fund type switching and that independent workers are more likely to voluntarily enter the pension system as affiliates if they have greater pension finance literacy.

It contributes to the literature on the prediction of financial crises mainly in two ways: first, it uses a Financial Stress Index for identifying the starting date of systemic financial crises. Second, it uses discrete choice models that combine both domestic and global indicators of macro-financial vulnerabilities to predict systemic financial crises. The performance of the models is evaluated in a framework that takes into account policy maker's preferences between missing crises and issuing false alarms. Our analysis shows that combining indicators of domestic and global macro-financial vulnerabilities substantially improves the models' ability to forecast systemic financial crises.

Privatization policies may involve a shift in the way governments are able to intervene in markets, while airports - unlike network infrastructures - are subject to mixed degrees of competition and monopoly characteristics. In this regard, our main hypothesis is that the impact of privatization on regulatory reform will be dependent on the competition scenario that prevails in each airport. We provide empirical evidence that the stringency of regulatory reform is related to the level of existing competition. Large airports, with substantial market power, tend to be subject to highly prescriptive regulation and airports that have nearby competing airports tend to be subject to less prescriptive regulation.","[Bel, Germa; Fageda, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Bel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Policy, Avd Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; Fageda, Xavier/F-6635-2018","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Fageda, Xavier/0000-0001-8526-8169",,,,,34,6,7,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

We collected data on literacy growth for a non-random sample of 1,376 Ontario children in Grades 1-3 during the summers of 2010 and 2011. Summer learning was widely dispersed with a mean of zero, and equal proportions of children had substantial learning gains and losses. There were strong disparities by family socio-economic status (SES), as affluent children gained literacy while those from poorer families lost literacy. We attributed 25 percent of the gap between the top and bottom SES quartiles at the start of the school year to the previous summer.

Recent literature suggests that this compliance cost dividend is significant (Fell and Morgenstern Environ Resour Econ 47:275-297, 2010). Allowance banking may yield an environmental dividend (a) if the growth rate of marginal damages from emissions is less than the discount rate and (b) if emissions are lower in the short run as firms bank permits for use in later periods. A discrete, stochastic dynamic programming model is considered to simulate the two dividends of allowance banking in the context of the most recent Federal United States greenhouse gas cap-and-trade legislation. Simulation results show that under a range of parameter values, the environmental dividend has the same order of magnitude as the compliance cost dividend. Under the central set of parameters, allowance banking increases expected present value of benefits by about million dollars per year of the program. The environmental dividend, however, is completely eliminated if capped firms can borrow permits from future periods without limit.","Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Leard, B (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 316 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",BPL47@cornell.edu,,,,,,,25,5,5,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The continuous approximation models are developed for airline operations in restricted and unrestricted single-hub systems. The models can support strategic planning of many-to-many airline distribution systems. Using the proposed models, the effects of changing domestic air travel demand in the United States over the years on optimal hub location are evaluated. Different levels of indifference areas of the optimal hub location are also analyzed in order to investigate the sensitivity of the studied logistic problem to the hub location. It is found that none of the existing major airline hubs fall within the 5% indifference area. However, the 10% indifference areas include Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas, homes to United, Delta, and American Airlines, respectively. The impact of a competitive airline network structure with regard to the hub location is also studied. This study addresses a gap in the airline service planning literature on modeling the optimal market for an airline in a competitive structure with multiple airlines and already located hubs. Results from the continuous model can also provide guidelines for constructing solutions to the more detailed, but computationally heavy discrete design models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In a first step we apply Lazear's jack-of-all-trades theory to investigate performance effects of a balanced skill set. Second, we investigate potential sources of balanced skills, thereby testing the investment hypothesis against the endowment hypothesis. Analyzing data on high-potential nascent projects, we find support for the notion that balanced skills are important for making progress in the venture creation process. Regarding the origins of balanced skills, the data support both hypotheses. In line with the investment hypothesis, an early interest in an entrepreneurial career, prior managerial and entrepreneurial experience are significantly related with a more balanced skill set. Supporting the endowment hypothesis, an entrepreneurial personality profile indicating entrepreneurial talent is correlated with a balanced skill set. Our results thus hint at the need for theories on the origins of a balanced skill set that integrate both views.","[Stuetzer, Michael] Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Obschonka, Martin; Schmitt-Rodermund, Eva] Univ Jena, Dept Dev Psychol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Obschonka, Martin; Schmitt-Rodermund, Eva] Univ Jena, Ctr Appl Dev Sci, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Stuetzer, M (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, QUT Business Sch, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",michael.stuetzer@qut.edu.au; martin.obschonka@uni-jena.de; eva.schmitt-rodermund@uni-jena.de,,"Obschonka, Martin/0000-0002-0853-7166; Schmitt-Rodermund, Eva/0000-0003-4582-5666; Stuetzer, Michael/0000-0001-9375-8125",,,,,94,59,81,2,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The analyses show that managerial equity-based compensation exacerbates firms' information asymmetry problems by focusing managers on the interests of existing shareholders. Firms with equity-based compensation rely more on internal funds. When there is a one-standard deviation increase in managerial equity-based compensation, firms will invest $0.05 more, save $0.02 more as cash and make a $0.07 lower net payout in response to a $1 increase in cash flow. Furthermore, the significant impact of managerial incentives on firms' cash flow sensitivities is predominant in small firms and firms with high market-to-book values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We relate spending to (1) Keynesian determinants of countercyclical policy, (2) congressional power and dominance, and (3) presidential electoral vote importance. We find that the ARRA is, in practice, poorly designed countercyclical stimulus. After controlling for political variables, coefficients on Keynesian variables are often statistically insignificant. When they are statistically significant they are often the incorrect sign. On the other hand, statistically significant effects are associated with majority party House of Representative appropriations subcommittee and authorization committee membership. One striking result is that the elasticity of ARRA spending with respect to the pre-ARRA ratio of federal grants and payments to federal taxes paid is estimated to be greater than unity in most specifications. States previously capturing large amounts of federal funds continue to do so under the ARRA stimulus.","[Young, Andrew T.; Sobel, Russell S.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Young, AT (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",Andrew.Young@mail.wvu.edu; rsobel2@wvu.edu,,"Sobel, Russell/0000-0001-6820-5414",,,,,24,26,32,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2013,155.0,3-4,,,,,449,468,,10.1007/s11127-011-9876-x,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,138NQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318515700014,0

However, these benefits are not always distributed equally among different population groups. This research seeks to determine whether the benefits of Toronto's public transit system are equitably distributed, and how these benefits change from 1996 to 2006 after the implementation of several transit projects in the region. We develop a methodology using a social indicator based on census tract level socio-economic characteristics to measure the relationship between social disadvantage and accessibility to jobs and transit travel time in the Toronto region over time. Transit equity is examined at three levels: spatially, temporally, and by job type. We find the range in accessibility and transit travel time narrows over the 10 year period. In addition, the most socially disadvantaged census tracts have statistically significantly better accessibility and lower transit travel times relative to the rest of the region in both 1996 and in 2006. Our findings show that Toronto has a generally equitable transit system that benefits those in social need, who are likely to gain the most from transit. The methodology proposed presents a useful way to bring issues of social equity directly into the land use and transportation planning process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine whether policy coordination (choices of policy instruments or policy harmonization) encourages environmental innovation when firms have strategic innovation incentives that may influence future regulation. In a case where policies are non-cooperatively set by governments, quantity regulations yield a greater static benefit for countries; however, dynamically, price regulations encourage more innovation than quantity regulations when environmental damages are not so large. Under both price and quantity regulation regimes, cooperative policy harmonization necessarily enhances net benefits in each country, whereas it discourages firms' innovation incentives when environmental damages are not so small.","Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan",,"Hattori, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",hattori@osaka-ue.ac.jp,,"Hattori, Keisuke/0000-0001-8686-4704",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730210] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,4,4,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Focusing primarily on the Japanese yen carry trade, we identify a significant impact of macro-economic surprises on dollar/yen risk reversals. The effect is sizeable, with news related to bilateral trade balance of particular concern. Moreover, there is a close link between risk reversals and speculative futures positions in Japanese yen.

We characterize the equilibria of the model and derive the comparative statics of improvements to the local public goods.

We utilize the General Social Survey (Cycle 21 2007) to examine the extent to which MR has been a binding constraint on the retirement decision of Canadians. We find a significant MR effect, especially for late-arriving immigrants, who are more likely to suffer financial hardship when they are forced to reitre. Accordingly, recent legislation restricting the practice of MR can be expected to result in important welfare gains for many older workers.","[Grant, Hugh; Townsend, James] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",University of Winnipeg,"Grant, H (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,10,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

In one, sellers set list prices based on their expectations of future changes in sales prices and the arrival rate of buyers; however, demand shocks occur. This model partially explains our data from the Belfast, U.K. housing market, but it fails to predict the list to sales price ratio during a sustained housing boom. We next describe a model where sellers' endogenously select their search mechanism depending on the strength of the housing market. We find support for the conjecture that sellers switch to an auction-like model during housing booms. There also is evidence that during a downturn in the market, sellers' list prices are sticky.

Two, we show that a leverage ratio rule controls for the same risks as does a Value-at-Risk (VaR) capital adequacy rule.

Some assign policymaking responsibility to institutions designed to be insulated from myopic partisan and electoral pressures and others do not. In this study, we claim that differences in political context and institutional design constrain the policy choices governments make. Testable propositions based on an analysis of varying electoral incentives and time horizons created by these different contexts are empirically tested using panel data on official general fund revenue forecasts in the American states, 1987 to 2008. The empirical evidence reveals that executive branch agencies and independent commissions produce more conservative forecasts than legislatures with one important exception. Executive branch revenue forecasts in states with gubernatorial term limits are indistinguishable from legislative branch forecasts. Further, we find that legislative branch forecasts are more conservative in the presence of divided partisan legislatures than unified party government. In turn, this implies that entrusting policymaking authority to either the executive branch or an independent commission may only be consequential when the political system itself fails to check legislative excesses or executive myopia.","[Krause, George A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Lewis, David E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Douglas, James W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Vanderbilt University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Krause, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, 4442 Wesley W Posvar Hall,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,78,29,35,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

The findings of the study show that environmental disclosure is positively linked to environmental performance. Company attributes, such as large size, the need for capital, profitability and capital spending, are positively associated with environmental disclosure quality. High quality environmental disclosers display effective corporate governance and would tend to face less difficulties in accessing capital markets. They generally are audited by a big 4 auditor or cross-listed on foreign stock exchanges and display significant levels of managerial and institutional ownership. High quality environmental disclosures are value relevant and improve investor perceptions.

We characterize the conditions under which the BPT problem with a single foreign market has an optimal solution, and show that the optimal portfolio contains the traditional mean-variance efficient portfolio without consideration of exchange rate risk, and an uncorrelated component constructed to hedge against exchange rate risk. We illustrate that the optimal portfolio must be mean-variance efficient with exchange rate risk, while the same is not true from the perspective of local investors unless certain conditions are satisfied. We further establish that international portfolio selection in the BPT with multiple foreign markets consists of two sequential decisions. Investors first select the optimal BPT portfolio in each market, overlooking covariances among markets, and then allocate funds across markets according to a specific rule to achieve mean-variance efficiency or to minimize the loss in efficiency.

Our identification strategy exploits the crisis as a shock to credit supply and combines an exogenous measure of firms dependence on external financing with policy interventions aimed at restoring bank capital.

It finds significant evidence of common trends in the US and Brazilian economies and bond markets as well as spillover effects from US inflation and business cycles to the Brazilian economy. The US Fed Funds rate influences Brazilian sovereign spreads, as do Brazilian inflation and policy rates. The Brazilian confidence factor dominates the behavior of the spreads during periods of crisis and we find that it also has a powerful effect on the level and volatility of macroeconomic variables. These results suggest that the macro-finance approach could throw light upon the behavior of other economies that are troubled by sovereign risk. (C) 2012 Bank of England. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the project was to decrease transport costs and increase competitiveness for peripheral regions such as West Virginia by upgrading existing branch lines to double-stack capacity and building new intermodal terminals. The paper develops a theoretical framework for institutional analysis, combining the overall institutional setting with the roles of individual actors confronting a collective action problem. Results suggest that the project represents an observable trend in freight funding policy in the United States, moving away from congressional earmarks which have been criticised in the past for their subjective nature, and towards a more transparent, bid-based system. Findings from the research demonstrate that the institutional setting has been transformed, moving towards a reconciliation between top-down planning approaches and market-driven private sector development. Furthermore, encouragement of multi-state public-private consortia will potentially make it easier to develop national corridors that can support new markets, while generating both public and private benefits.

Our analysis shows that exchange rate volatility of the Thai baht against four major currencies-the US dollar, the British pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen-appears to be larger during the period of the imposition of the unremunerated reserve requirement in 2006-2007. Using a data set of publicly traded firms in Thailand, we find that the exposure of firms to exchange rate volatility appears to change during the unremunerated reserve requirement period relative to the pre- and post-unremunerated reserve requirement period. We also find that the effect of exchange rate volatility during the unremunerated reserve requirement period on stock returns is stronger for some firms than others. The results suggest that the unremunerated reserve requirement affects asset prices, through larger exchange rate volatility and through changes in exposure of firms to exchange rate volatility.

The Web 2.0 based learning may involve the use of blogs, Wikis, online social community (e.g. Facebook, Twitter), Dropbox - a file hosting service that offers cloud storage, file synchronization and client software, online video sharing (e.g. YouTube), online video and audio conferencing tool, and social virtual environment (e.g. Second life). Web 2.0 has provides rich web tools to help student's have better learning platform and ensures far-reaching impact on the student's performance. Furthermore, this technology can support education in terms of participation, interaction, sharing of knowledge, social networking, critical reading, critical thinking and writing, collaboration, and expression of opinions. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study (quantitative) has been conducted on the selected respondents randomly. A random sample of 100 respondents is adopted by the questionnaire survey method. The results will be obtained on measuring the students' performance after the students' adopt Web 2.0 Technology for learning purpose. Findings - The finding in this study present the perception and awareness of students on Web 2.0 technology and its influence on their academic performance. Based on regression analysis, the results indicated that the two factors awareness and perception of students' on the use of web 2.0 technology significantly relates to students' academic performance. Overall outcome of this study is that the use of Web 2.0 technology in higher education is quite positive. From the students' perspectives when analyzed it suggests that they clearly realize the benefits of the use of Web 2.0 tools in their education. Originality/value - While the importance of this study are to provide evidence that most students feel that integrating Web 2.0 in context of learning can be effective at improve their learning ability. From a research perspective, the results demonstrate the use of Web 2.0 tools has significant potential to support and enhance in-class teaching and learning in higher education.","[Aaijaz, Naila] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Entrepreneurship & Business, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Mustapha, Noraani Bt] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Entrepreneurship & Business, Dept Business & Econm, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Nik, Yah Bt Awg] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Ctr Language Studies & Generic Dev, Modern Languages Dept, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Ibrahim, Wan Mohd Yusuff Bin Wan] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Entrepreneurship & Business, Ctr Postgraduate Studies, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan,,naila@umk.edu.my; noraani@umk.edu.my; yah@umk.edu.my; yusuffibrahim86@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9821489-9-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,647,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301200065,0

Short-run analyses focus on the cost-effectiveness of incremental increases in solar capacity, holding the rest of the power system fixed. Solar's variability adds value if its power occurs at high-demand times and displaces relatively carbon-intensive generation. Medium-run analyses consider the implications of nonincremental changes in solar capacity. The cost of each installation may fall through experience effects, but the cost of grid integration increases when solar requires ancillary services and fails to displace investment in other types of generation. Long-run analyses consider the role of solar in reaching twenty-first-century carbon targets. Solar's contribution depends on the representation of grid integration costs, on the availability of other low-carbon technologies, and on the potential for technological advances. By surveying analyses for different time horizons, this article begins to connect and integrate a fairly disjointed literature on the economics of solar energy.","[Baker, Erin] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Fowlie, Meredith] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lemoine, Derek; Reynolds, Stanley S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Arizona,"Baker, E (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",edbaker@ecs.umass.edu; fowlie@berkeley.edu; dlemoine@email.arizona.edu; reynolds@eller.arizona.edu,"Baker, Erin/R-7481-2019","Baker, Erin/0000-0002-4139-9930; Lemoine, Derek/0000-0002-1298-9472","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0745161] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,120,85,95,2,66,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,1941-1359,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

The objective of HR-marketing does not restrict on capability to control the situation on labor market to cover organizational needs efficiently, but to expand different ways of using segmentation, as long as using the method of internal competitiveness among employees. The elements of the HR marketing are personnel technologies such as continuous assessment of employment of staff to determine the competitiveness of the domestic and professional prospects of the key employees, the development of motivational systems. The difference of this technique from many others is that the employee assesses its compliance functionality in comparison with the achievements of other comparable groups of workers, causing some stress.

Given that a company forms a micro financial system, its good financial health contributes to building a powerful economic engine; therefore, we have selected a sample of 20 firms over 3 years (2009-2011) whose 39 financial indicators are provided, and we have used Principal Factor Analysis (PFA) approach to reduce the dimension of the input matrix to 8 factors that impact on the firms' financial health, in order to set up our Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model through which we can predict firms' creditworthiness risk.

Agency theory argues that in order to protect the shareholders' interests, the board of directors plays a vital role. The success of a cooperative depends on the degree of participation of its members. The objective of this paper is to examine the association between cooperative governance in terms of members' participation and gender (male composition of the board), and performance. This study examined the annual reprots from 2008 to 2012 of 34 cooperatives in Malaysia. It was found that male directors dominate the board of cooperatives in Malaysia. Insignificant relationship was found between the male composition in the board with performance. The mean of members' participation (attendance of directors at board meetings) was found to be high but it did have any significant association with cooperative performance. This results contradicted with those of past studies. The limitation of the data set available has restricted the scope of analysis.

As productivity is the main concern of this paper, the moderating role of support policy is emphasized in this conceptual model. The propose model is important to reveal the trend of output and input in agriculture as well as the determinants of agricultural growth in Malaysia and ASEAN countries. From the graphical trends, it is not possible to assess the contribution of inputs (capital, labour, fertilizer etc.) to the overall output.

The objective of this paper is to investigate if there were significant signs of political budget cycles in all EU member states during 1995 - 2009; what are the countries where fiscal indicators are changing the most during election periods. The results showed that politicians of many EU countries rely on a number of fiscal indicators as a means of manipulation during election periods, seeking opportunistic goals. However, in developed EU countries budget cycle is a more common phenomenon than in developing countries. In addition, the manipulation of the expenditures is a more popular tool among politicians than the manipulation of revenue during election periods.","[Kalendiene, Jone] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44248 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,,j.kalendiene@evf.vdu.lt; r.petreikyte@evf.vdu.lt,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-86175-87-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,541,550,,,,,,10,Demography; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA9BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339103100055,0

The process of trade integration in all EU countries was not as fast as the process of financial integration.

It seems that central bank of Indonesia consistently conducts prudent monetary policy to set interest rate in order to maintain stable domestic currency to reach financial stability in the long run.","[Marlissa, Elsyan Rienette] Cenderawasih Univ, Fac Econ, Jayapura, Indonesia",Cenderawasih University,,elsyan_marlissa@yahoo.com; ari.warokka@yahoo.com,"Warokka, Ari Ari/P-5066-2016; Marlissa, Elsyan Rienette/K-1521-2018; Warokka, Ari/M-1314-2019","Warokka, Ari Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780; Marlissa, Elsyan Rienette/0000-0001-7555-4671; Warokka, Ari/0000-0003-2332-4780",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-0-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,1277,1284,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA9EI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339301100135,0

It is found out that Internet users are the most active social group of rural population demonstrating a high level of professional education and innovative culture. They know how to derive social and economic benefits from new technologies and knowledge. The deepening digital inequality among local rural communities cannot be overcome only through providing technical and economic access to new technologies.

Due to the low rainfall in the southern parts of the country it is predominantly used for sheep farming while the central parts are used for cattle farming. There are basically four different marketing alternatives for sheep from commercial producers in Namibia. The live export of sheep to South Africa always was the best-priced market for Namibian producers. Since the SSMS had placed a limit on the amount of sheep that may be exported, the number of local slaughtering for export and local consumption has increased. These market options, however, results in a lower producer price and the average price for mutton and lamb in Namibia had thus decreased in comparison with the prices in South Africa. A focus group study was used to derive a collaborative marketing strategy for farmers. After conducting a risk analysis and setting short, medium and long term objectives, a SWOT analysis and TOWS matrix assisted the producers in deriving a strategy. After discussing every strategic option, the group decided that they will first market to the Windhoek market through a group-owned butchery. They will target the higher income groups, by selling high-value cuts in large quantities and low-value cuts to the low-income groups, thereby integrating further down the supply chain and gaining a larger proportion of the consumer dollar.","[Morris, L.; Mare, F.

To create environmental consciousness and raise awareness of environmental protection at an early age, it is very important to make a proper assessment of answers given to the questions about the role of education in the creation of environmental awareness and environmental protection, when and how such education should take place, and from where such education should be received to achieve higher efficiency. In this context, the answers to the aforementioned questions will help us develop healthy methods to create environmental consciousness, raise realistic, permanent awareness of environmental protection, and instill good habits.

Capital structure theory is inevitably linked to several important empirical issues such as (a) the term structure of credit spreads, (b) the level of credit spreads implied by structural models in relation to the ones that we observe in the data, (c) the cross-sectional variations in leverage ratios, (d) the types of defaults and renegotiations that one observes in real life, (e) the manner in which investment and financial structure decisions interact, (f) the link between corporate liquidity and corporate capital structure, (g) the design of capital structure of banks [contingent capital (CC)], (h) linkages between business cycles and capital structure, etc. The literature, building on Merton's insights, has attempted to tackle these issues by significantly enhancing the original framework proposed in his model to make the theoretical framework richer (by modeling frictions such as agency costs, moral hazard, bankruptcy codes, renegotiations, investments, state of the macroeconomy, etc.) and in greater accordance with stylized facts.

We used Dutch Travel Surveys from 1995 and 2004-2008 to estimate the empirical distribution from a spatial interaction model as function of travel time and distance. We find that the distribution function is not transferable in time and space. Instead, the propensity to travel longer to work has grown over time. As a result, the average commute length has increased. Contrary, land use changes appeared to have a much smaller effect on commuting distances in this period. The propensity to make longer commute trips also increases with city-size. However, this does not lead to an increase in average commuting distance with city-size, because it is offset by smaller distances between residences and jobs in large cities. The results are quite relevant for spatial interaction modeling. They indicate that the concept of one stable distribution function is insufficient to accurately describe aggregated travel behavior.

It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide insights into the comprehension of Chinese learners' acquisition process of the definite article and give some inspiration for English learning and teaching in China.","[Wang, Tianyi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,,wangtianyi901126@163.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-139-3,,,,2013,,,,,,,314,321,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA7HH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337529900053,0

The data set not only enables us to control for a wide range of pay-determining characteristics but also is the first to enable an analysis of the different components of pay (e.g., base pay and performance pay) as well as for total pay. We find: (1) Women receive about three-quarters of male pay for each of the dimensions of base pay, performance pay, and total pay, before adjusting for the effect of different pay-determining factors; (2) Approximately two-thirds of the gap reflect the fact that females tend to be paid less than males for the same wage-determining characteristics (often labeled as discrimination), while about one-third reflects the fact that males have endowments or characteristics that tend to be associated with higher pay, especially supervisory responsibilities, general labor market experience, occupational skills, education, and membership in the Communist party; (3) Marriage has a large positive effect on the earnings of women in China (and none for men), but childcare responsibilities for children under the age of 6 have a large negative effect on the earnings of women although these are offset almost completely if an elder family member is present, highlighting that childcare responsibilities disproportionately fall on women unless an elder family member is present; (4) Pay premiums for higher level skills and higher supervisory ranks are remarkably small for both males and especially females; (5) With respect to the unexplained or discriminatory portion of the gap, females get a huge pay penalty for simply being female, but a substantial portion of this gets offset by the higher pay premium they receive for such factors as Han ethnicity, being married, and education. This suggests that discrimination tends to occur in the form of a pay penalty for simply being female and not from lower returns to the same endowments of pay-determining characteristics.

Yet empirically, the correlation between cash and spreads is robustly positive. This puzzling finding can be explained by the precautionary motive for saving cash, which in our model causes riskier firms to accumulate higher cash reserves. In contrast, spreads are negatively related to the part of cash holdings that is not determined by credit risk factors. Similarly, although firms with higher cash reserves are less likely to default in the short term, endogenously determined liquidity may be related positively to the longer-term probability of default. Our empirical analysis confirms these predictions, suggesting that precautionary savings are central to understanding the effects of cash on credit risk.","[Davydenko, Sergei A.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Acharya, Viral] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Strebulaev, Ilya A.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Strebulaev, Ilya A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Toronto; New York University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Davydenko, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",davydenko@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,51,161,203,7,129,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We construct an index of divergence of the three trilemma policy choices, and evaluate its patterns in recent decades. We find that the three dimensions of the trilemma configurations are converging toward a middle ground among emerging market economies, equipped with managed exchange rate flexibility, underpinned by sizable holdings of international reserves, and intermediate levels of monetary independence and financial integration. We also find emerging market economies with more converged policy choices tend to experience smaller output volatility in the last two decades. Emerging markets with relatively low international reserves/GDP could experience higher levels of output volatility when they choose a policy combination with a greater degree of policy divergence while this heightened output volatility effect does not apply to economies with relatively high international reserves/GDP holding.

In contrast, series with a cyclical component would seem to be forecastable with decreases, possibly relative to a trend, during the upper part of the cycle and increases during the lower part. On the basis of autoregressive model (AR) estimates, it is considered that there is strong evidence of cycles in insurance underwriting performance as measured by the premium-to-loss ratio. Indeed, a large literature attempts to explain this documented cyclicality. First, we show that the parameter estimates from AR models do not lead to any such inference and that in the contrary, the evidence in the data is consistent with no cyclicality at all. Second, we show that a number of different filters lead to the same conclusion: that there is no evidence of in-sample or out-of-sample predictability in annual insurance underwriting performance in the United States.","[Boyer, M.

The state variables have a macrofactor interpretation. The results are applied to maximum likelihood estimation of a macroparameter and to computation of a granularity adjusted Value-at-Risk (VaR) for large portfolios.

Our sectoral approach builds on three premises: (i) cap-and-trade systems are established in industrialized countries and intensity targets in developing countries, (ii) sectors subject to international trade abide by the rules of the countries in which they trade and (iii) a fraction of the revenues from permits in industrialized countries go towards carbon mitigation in developing countries. We design an economic model that features interactions in three carbon-intensive sectors (two of which are internationally traded) and two countries (an industrialized country and a developing country). Two scenarios are constructed: an Enhanced Sectoral Approach, which refers to our proposal, and a Global Cap, which implements a uniform CO2 price. We compare the two scenarios in terms of total welfare and equity. It is shown that, for a minor global welfare loss, the Enhanced Sectoral Approach ranks high in terms of equity for emerging countries. This approach also eliminates competitiveness and leakage issues.","[Meunier, Guy] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Ponssard, Jean-Pierre] INRA UR1303 ALISS, F-94205 Ivry, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay,"Meunier, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",guy.meunier@polytechnique.edu,"Meunier, Guy/E-8948-2018","Meunier, Guy/0000-0002-9052-921X",,,,,34,5,6,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Clearing house loan certificates were extensions of credit by the New York Clearing House to its members. These certificates were transferable to other clearing house members as a form of final payment for settlement of interbank payments. The certificate issues allowed borrowing banks to maintain (and increase) loans, fulfill cash payment upon depositor withdrawal demands, and enabled gold imports, which took two to three weeks to arrive. The large, New York City national banks acted as private liquidity providers by requesting (and the New York Clearing House issuing) a volume of clearing house loan certificates in excess of their own immediate liquidity needs, in accord with their role as central reserve city banks in the national banking system.

More recently, a number of studies have pointed to the effect of housing market conditions on family formation. This implies that housing markets are influenced by population change, but also that the housing market conditions influence population change. In this study, a model of demographic effects on the housing market that has been estimated on regional panel data will be used to explore these interrelationships. First, it is shown that the age effects identified in sub-national data are present also in cross-national data. Second, it is shown that high demographic pressure on house prices is associated with low fertility. The findings are discussed in relation to the Easterlin's hypothesis about the effects of cohort crowding on fertility. In Easterlin's model, cohort effects on earnings drive fertility shifts. The analysis presented, herein, indicates that cohort effects in the housing market can be equally important. Finally, the estimated models are used to outline possible future trends in house prices and fertility. The results indicate that house price increases can slow down and that there can be some recovery from very low fertility rates.","Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Malmberg, B (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Malmberg, Bo/G-1429-2010",,,,,,27,9,11,4,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We show that the firm's optimal production decision is independent of the underlying uncertainty and of the firm's risk attitude. We further show that the firm's optimal futures position is a full-hedge that completely eliminates the output price risk if either the background risk is state-independent, or the firm's utility function is quadratic. When the firm's preferences exhibit prudence, an under-hedge or an over-hedge is optimal should the magnitude of the background risk vary in a monotonic manner with changes in the realized state. When the prudent firm has access not only to the unbiased futures contracts but also to fairly priced options, we construct a reasonable example wherein the firm optimally includes the options in its hedge position. Hence, we offer a rationale for the hedging role of options, which is over and above that of futures, in the case of state-dependent background risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

While supporters claim that biofuels are renewable and carbon-friendly, concerns have been raised about their impacts on land use and food prices. This paper analyzes how US crop prices have responded to shocks in acreage supply; these shocks can be thought of as a shock to the residual supply of corn for food. Using a structural vector auto-regression framework, we examine shocks to a crop's own acreage and to total cropland. This allows us to estimate the effect of dedicating cropland or non-crop farmlands to biofuels feedstock production. A negative shock in own acreage leads to an increase in price for soybeans and corn. Our calculations show that increased corn ethanol production during the boom production year 2006/2007 explains approximately 27% of the experienced corn price rise.","[Hausman, Catherine; Auffhammer, Maximilian; Berck, Peter] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Hausman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",calmirall@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,32,30,36,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

These forecast methods are traditionally evaluated by means of the unconditional backtest. This paper formally shows that the unconditional backtest is always inconsistent for backtesting HS and FHS models, with a power function that can be even smaller than the nominal level in large samples. Our findings have fundamental implications in the determination of market risk capital requirements, and also explain Monte Carlo and empirical findings in previous studies. We also propose a data-driven weighted backtest with good power properties to evaluate HS and MS forecasts. A Monte Carlo study and an empirical application with three US stocks confirm our theoretical findings. The empirical application shows that multiplication factors computed under the current regulatory framework are downward biased, as they inherit the inconsistency of the unconditional backtest.

We compare different citation indexes, as the number of citations per author, the H-index or the G-index, which we calculate at the individual and at the department levels, with some Econlit publication scores.

The investor follows a buy-and-hold strategy in the stock, the money market account, and one additional derivative. We show that both the type of the model and the structure of the risk premia have a significant impact on the optimal portfolio, on the utility gain from having access to derivatives, and on whether the investor prefers to trade OTM or ATM options. We also show that model mis-specification results in significant utility losses. Omitting jumps in volatility can be devastating, in particular if the investor chooses the seemingly optimal OTM put options. A misestimation of the structure of the risk premia has a less devastating effect, but can still lead to a loss of around 4% in the annual certainty equivalent return. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is in contrast with previous studies, which typically have assumed that taxes respond to the level of debt, and have found either a confirmation or reversal of the Taylor principle depending on the feedback from debt to taxes. We find, instead, that the equilibrium effect of the interest rate on debt is crucial for determinacy. If, as in our model, taxes are raised in response to debt interest payments, the range of indeterminacy monotonically decreases with the fiscal feedback parameter. When interest payments are completely tax-financed, indeterminacy is ruled out without any restrictions on monetary policy.","[Linnemann, Ludger; Schabert, Andreas] TU Dortmund Univ, Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Linnemann, L (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund Univ, Dortmund, Germany.",,"Schabert, Andreas/AAD-8901-2022","Schabert, Andreas/0000-0002-4924-9937",,,,,17,0,0,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Attachment theory examines the psychological tendency to seek proximity to another person, to feel secure when that person is present, and to feel anxious when that person is absent. An individual's attachment style can be classified along two-dimensional axes, one representing attachment avoidance and one representing attachment anxiety. Avoidant people generally feel discomfort when being close to others, have trouble trusting people and distance themselves from intimate or revealing situations. Anxious people have a fear of abandonment and of not being loved. Utilizing attachment theory, we evaluate the connection between attachment types and economic decision making, and find that in an Ultimatum Game both proposers' and responders' behavior can be explained by their attachment styles, as implied by the theory. We demonstrate how knowledge of the attachment type of the responder can be utilized by the proposer in order to maximize his expected income. We believe this theory has implications for economic behavior in different settings, such as negotiations, in general, and more specifically, may help explain behavior, and perhaps even anomalies, in other experimental settings.

Half of the liquidity decline reflects attention constraints binding on the individual market maker, and the other half is explained by the market maker's inventory.

As it is known, during transition from centrally planned system to market mechanisms, the society passes through deep restructuration, consisting in complex institutional changes, technological shifts, sectoral reallocation of productive factors, which continuously affected the input-output technical coefficients. Testing the RAS algorithm on such a volatile framework is a notable search challenge. Our empirical experiment is based on annual input-output tables for two decades (1989-2008). In order to easier manipulate the available data base, the extended classification of economic activities containing 105 branches has been aggregated into 10 sectors. For each year, two (10x10) matrices: a(ij) (statistically recorded technical coefficients) and ra(ij) (the same coefficients estimated using RAS method) were computed. The paper is organized in three sections. The first discusses several methodological issues of this algorithm. It also evaluates the differences between matrices aij and raij, involving both categories of accuracy measures - either the cell-by-cell comparison or the aggregated indicators. The second section extensively examines these measures, the presentation being systematized sectorally. Such an approach allows revealing specificities of different branches in their inter-industry co-operation. The third section sketches an overview of the obtained results and extracts some conclusions related to the problems that arise in the application of RAS method.","[Dobrescu, Emilian; Gaftea, Viorel] Romanian Acad, Ctr Macroecon Modelling, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Dobrescu, E (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Ctr Macroecon Modelling, Bucharest, Romania.",emiliand@clicknet.ro,"Dobrescu, Emilian/AAK-4781-2021","Dobrescu, Emilian/0000-0002-6063-1125",,,,,21,6,7,0,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,JUN,2012,14.0,32,,,,,502,521,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,964ED,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000305675600015,0

We study this stylized fact for the case of a major German stock index, the DAX, by recovering index implied volatility from simulating the 30-dimensional return system of all DAX constituents. Option prices are computed after risk neutralization of the multivariate process which is estimated under the physical probability measure. The multivariate models belong to the class of copula asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation models. We show that moderate tail dependence coupled with asymmetric correlation response to negative news is essential to explain the index implied volatility skew. Standard dynamic correlation models with zero tail dependence fail to generate a sufficiently steep implied volatility skew.","[Fengler, Matthias R.] Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Kiel, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University of St Gallen; University of Kiel,"Fengler, MR (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Bodanstr 6, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",matthias.fengler@unisg.ch,,"Fengler, Matthias/0000-0002-9862-9258",,,,,90,5,5,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

This rise occurred in the context of a consumer culture highlighting supposed psychological benefits of consumer goods. This paper reports findings from two studies, conducted during an economic boom in Iceland, examining the association of materialism and indicators of financial well-being: amount of debt, financial worries, spending tendency, money-management skills and compulsive buying. Study 1(1) (N = 271) showed that people who endorse materialistic values have more financial worries, worse money-management skills and greater tendency towards compulsive buying and spending. Study 2 (N= 191) replicates the findings of Study 1 and further shows that amount of debt, including mortgage, can be directly linked to materialism, controlling for income and money-management skills. The research contributes to the psychology of materialism and overspending and provides an evidence-based foundation for designing interventions encouraging individuals to improve their financial well-being.

Lack of self-control and financial illiteracy are positively associated with non-payment of consumer credit and self-reported excessive financial burdens of debt. Consumers who exhibit self-control problems are shown to make greater use of quick-access but high cost credit items such as store cards and payday loans. We also find consumers with self-control problems are more likely to suffer income shocks, credit withdrawals and unforeseen expenses on durables, suggesting that lack of self-control increases exposure to a variety of risks. In most specifications we find a stronger role for lack of self-control than for financial illiteracy in explaining consumer over-indebtedness. We discuss the policy implications of these findings.

We develop grounded theory based on Unisys' case, which reveals how exogenous technological changes at the industry level and shifts in a firm's strategy shape the composition of partners and the nature of alliance relationships. We identify four evolutionary processes: responding to external stimuli, breaking off inertial pressures, enabling coevolution, and restructuring and realigning the alliance portfolio. We shift attention from alliance formation decisions to changes in the nature of alliances and partner characteristics throughout the duration of the alliance portfolio. We suggest that the evolution of alliance portfolios cannot be fully explained by path dependence, life-cycle patterns, or proactive design. Instead, alliance portfolios are shaped by environmental stimuli and conflicting organizational processes.","[Lavie, Dovev] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Singh, Harbir] Univ Penn, Dept Management, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; University of Pennsylvania,"Lavie, D (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",dlavie@ie.technion.ac.il; singh@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,88,45,47,1,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Whereas the home-asset bias is a preference for domestic assets, the home-institution bias is a preference for domestic financial institutions. Our data come from Sweden's government-mandated retirement system. In cross-fund regressions, we find that funds offered by Swedish institutions received around 10 times more money than similar funds offered by foreign institutions. We show that this preference for home institutions is distinct from the home-asset preference, is not driven by information asymmetries, and is consistent with an underlying preference by individuals to deal with the familiar. Cross-individual regressions also support a behavioral explanation because the home-institution bias is strongest among financially-unsophisticated and provincial investors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While theoretical models and anecdotal evidence suggest that compliance assistance should play some role in a comprehensive enforcement strategy, to date there has been relatively little empirical evidence on the actual effectiveness of existing compliance assistance programs. To help inform the debate over the appropriate use of compliance assistance, this paper uses data on hazardous waste generators nationwide to assess the effect of federal compliance assistance programs in improving compliance with hazardous waste regulations. The paper also conducts a direct empirical analysis of the relationship between traditional enforcement tools and compliance assistance. The results show that federal compliance assistance efforts do increase compliance, but the evidence does not suggest any consistent relationship between traditional enforcement and compliance assistance. Also, while states do not appear to substitute federal compliance assistance for traditional enforcement, state compliance assistance programs do appear to decrease the likelihood of inspections among the smallest hazardous waste generators.

In a standard structural VAR, an empirical measure of confidence does not significantly react to spending shocks and output multipliers are around one. In a non-linear VAR, confidence rises following an increase in spending during periods of economic slack and multipliers are much larger. The systematic response of confidence is irrelevant for the output multiplier during normal times, but is critical during recessions. Spending shocks during downturns predict productivity improvements through a persistent increase in government investment relative to consumption, which is reflected in higher confidence.

We find that financial analysts' idiosyncratic precision of information decreased and equity market participants acted as if they perceived higher information risk, as evidenced by reduced earnings response coefficients, in anticipation of guidance. We attribute these effects to a perceived increase in information risk and decrease in accounting information quality. We find that the actual implementation of the new rules reversed some, but not all, of these effects. On the other hand, we find that information users that likely had access to information regarding the off-balance-sheet debt structures prior to 2001 did not exhibit a similar reaction to the apparent change in information risk either in anticipation or upon implementation of the new guidance. Specifically, we find that banks did not increase the loan spreads for FIN 46 firms and credit rating agencies lowered the ratings of these firms only marginally more than those of other firms. This finding is consistent with our conjecture that these entities were aware of the fundamentals of FIN 46 firms even under the prior limited disclosure regime.","[Gunin, Umit G.] Univ Texas Dallas, Dallas, TX 75230 USA; [Lerman, Alina] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT USA; [Ronen, Joshua] NYU, New York, NY USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Yale University; New York University,"Gunin, UG (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Dallas, TX 75230 USA.",umit.gurun@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,45,3,3,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The sample covers major institutional changes, such as market liberalization and financial crises, so as to examine how the short-term and long-term relations change after such events. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001) is adopted, which allows us to deal with structural breaks easily, and to handle data that have integrals of different orders. Interest rates and foreign reserves are also included in the analysis to reduce potential omitted variable bias. My empirical results suggest that the comovement between exchange rates and stock prices becomes stronger during crisis periods, consistent with contagion or spillover between asset prices, when compared with tranquil periods. Furthermore, most of the spillovers during crisis periods can be attributed to the channel running from stock price shocks to the exchange rate, suggesting that governments should stimulate economic growth and stock markets to attract capital inflow, thereby preventing a currency crisis. However, the industry causality analysis shows the comovement is not stronger for export-oriented industries for all periods, such as industrials and technology industries, thus implying that comovement between exchange rates and stock prices in the Asian emerging markets is generally driven by capital account balance rather than that of trade.

We construct a logistic model to predict when it is optimal for a bidder to offer earnout. We show that bidders offering earnout optimally enjoy significantly higher announcement and post-acquisition gains than bidders offering non-earnout currencies, consistent with our model of the choice of the optimal method of payment. Overall, we provide robust evidence that earnout is an effective payment mechanism to mitigate valuation risk to acquirers, and also enhances acquirer value during the announcement and post-acquisition periods.

G.",,,A public health perspective on transport policy priorities,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transport; Public health; Health policy,OBESITY,"This paper briefly considers the history of public health delivery in England, its transition from local government to NHS leadership and back again, and the consequences of that shift in terms of transport policy as a determinant of health and wellbeing. General principles of modern public health thinking are outlined, emphasising the need for policy choices to consider the Rose hypothesis - that small changes in large populations are likely to deliver greater net benefits than large changes in small populations. Thus, in tackling the epidemic of obesity, a greater impact would arise from small alterations of exercise behaviour in the whole population than from large changes among the most obese. Against a policy background that emphasises 'nudge' approaches rather than legislative or regulatory action, a chain of rational decisions by individuals, communities and authorities is discussed that in aggregate leads to substantial adverse outcomes. It is suggested that there is no calculus of individual gain that can achieve optimal population benefit with regard to some aspects of transport policy. Features of the general strategic approach to health and wellbeing improvement in the North East of England over recent years are outlined, with a brief exploration of the issues that these raise for public health delivery by non-health service authorities. New opportunities for health and wellbeing gain are offered by shifts in the focus of public health delivery as we step back from an individualised medical model and re-assert the importance of civic and cross-sectoral action.

J,"Thornton, DL",,,,"Thornton, Daniel L.",,,The Dual Mandate: Has the Fed Changed Its Objective?,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The Federal Reserve is said to have a dual mandate of price stability and full employment. While the Fed has mentioned price stability as one of its primary goals, it has been reluctant to mention employment as a separate policy objective, preferring instead to state that maximum employment could best be achieved by achieving price stability. This hesitance ended with the December 2008 policy directive in which the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted its objectives were maximum employment and price stability Operationally equivalent language first appeared in the FOMC's policy statement in September 2010 and has appeared in every subsequent statement. This article reviews the FOMC transcripts and biannual statements to Congress to provide some insight into the Fed's historical reluctance to mention employment as an independent policy objective. The FOMC documents do not point to a specific reason for the historical reluctance, but they provide a few clues. Perhaps more importantly, they point to two changes that may explain the recent change in language: the increased emphasis on economic stabilization and the shift in emphasis from the growth rate of output to the level of output.

Households consume different product baskets, and therefore, face different inflation rates. The statistical bureau used in the model measures aggregate inflation, but observes product entry with a probabilistic delay. Consequently, measured inflation suffers from product replacement bias with respect to aggregate inflation. Measured inflation is less volatile but more persistent than aggregate inflation, and the correlation between aggregate inflation and aggregate output is lower than the correlation between measured inflation and measured output. When monetary policy responds to measured variables, it stabilizes aggregate inflation insufficiently. Nevertheless, under discretionary monetary policy, responding to measured variables improves welfare.","Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Weber, H (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",Henning.Weber@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We develop a model to describe the effect of an increase in leverage on regulated rates, retail as well as wholesale, and company investment. We then test the model's predictions using a panel of 15 EU Public Telecommunication Operators (PTOs) over the period 1994-2005. Our results show that the data cannot reject the model's predictions that leverage positively affects regulated wholesale and retail rates, as well as the PTOs' investment rate. Moreover, since leverage does affect wholesale charges that alternative operators pay to access to the incumbent's network infrastructure, we also find that an increase in leverage is followed by a decrease in the number of competitors and by an increase of the incumbent's market share. This suggests that the use of debt to discipline the regulator's lack of commitment within a vertically integrated network industry may somewhat impair or delay retail market competition, but has a favorable counterpart in mitigating the underinvestment problem.","[Cambini, Carlo; Rondi, Laura] Politecn Torino, DISPEA, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Rondi, Laura] CERIS CNR, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Rondi, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, DISPEA, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",carlo.cambini@polito.it; laura.rondi@polito.it,"Rondi, Laura/ADS-4154-2022","RONDI, Laura/0000-0002-7683-1164; CAMBINI, CARLO/0000-0002-7471-8133",,,,,59,17,18,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Our findings question the view that stable long-run inflation expectations and downward nominal wage rigidity will necessarily provide sufficient support to prices to avoid further declines in inflation. We show that an inflation model fitted on Japanese data over the past 20 years, which accounts for both short- and long-run inflation expectations, matches the recent U.S. inflation experience quite well. While the model indicates that U.S. inflation might be subject to a lower bound, it does not rule out a prolonged period of low inflation or even mild deflation going forward. In addition, micro-level data on wages suggest no obvious downward rigidity in the firm's wage bill, downward rigidity in individual wages notwithstanding. As a consequence, downward nominal wage rigidity may not be enough to offset deflationary pressures in the current situation.","[Fuhrer, Jeffrey C.; Olivei, Giovanni P.; Tootell, Geoffrey M.

The author examines the purported causal mechanisms underlying this curse and shows that they all center on the revenue that these resources generate for the government. As such, it is not surprising that the most recent literature on the topic has demonstrated that, in the hands of a competent government, natural resources have no negative consequences and may actually have positive effects. The important question therefore is: What can be done in countries without effective governments? Policy proposals have centered on (a) taking the resources out of the hands of the government or (b) having the government commit to use the funds in certain ways. Neither of these has been particularly successful, which we might have predicted from research on another important nontax revenue source for developing countries: foreign aid. The close parallels between the foreign aid and resource curse literatures are reviewed, as are the lessons from the aid literature. These lessons suggest the need for an important change in approach toward poorly governed resource-rich countries.","Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Morrison, KM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Govt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",morrison@cornell.edu,,,,,,,102,48,58,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

As welfare-maximizing policies are hard to implement and communicate, I derive a simple interest rate rule that depends only on observables but mimics the optimal plan in all dimensions.

Our investigation of the sustainable current account highlights macroeconomic factors that determine savings and investment in the medium-term.

In an experiment, we replicate the behavioral results on attraction to chance from a previous study and add physiological measures for the choice process. We find that attraction to chance can be explained by differences in emotions the subjects experience during the dynamic processes of different types of lotteries. These emotions can be cognitively reflected by the decision maker at the moment of choice and incorporated in expected utility.

On the other hand this new investment and the involvement of large scale agribusiness also offers the potential of bringing new technologies and techniques to the region. Could this technology transfer help Africa to replicate the Brazilian 'miracle'? The wider agricultural community, more familiar with tales of feuds and famine in Africa, has largely overlooked many of these changes, but this paper argues that it behoves the Agribusiness community to understand what is happening, and to ask: is it time for Agribusinesses to invest in Africa?","[Connolly, Aidan J.; Connolly, Kate Phillips] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Lyons, Mark] Alltech, Beijing 100020, Peoples R China; Alltech, Lexington, KY 40356 USA",Trinity College Dublin; Alltech United States; Alltech China; Alltech United States,"Connolly, AJ (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",aconnolly@alltech.com,,,,,,,4,2,2,1,22,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

It is also perceived as one of the conditions paving the way for improving the competitiveness of the economy and enhancing the provision of goods and services for the domestic market. With the implementation of global and regional strategies by MNCs, the choice of location is becoming increasingly important, hence requiring a better understanding of the internationalization process and of the factors influencing the spatial distribution of FDI. There have been numerous empirical studies that have focused on the location choices of MNCs and FDI flows in developed countries (Shaver, 1998; Head et al., 1995; Friedman et al., 1992; Culem, 1988; Nachum and Wymbs, 2005). Since early-2000s these studies have also started to concentrate on the transition economies within the CEE region (Campos and Kinoshita, 2003; Deichmann, 2001; Resmini, 2003, 2007; Boudier-Bensebaa, 2005; Cieslik and Ryan, 2005).

A partial equilibrium model of a national economy with two sectors and two regions, one of which includes a forest, is developed. It analyses how an exogenous increase in the ethanol price affects input allocation (land and labor) between sectors (energy crop and food). The total effect of ethanol prices on food production and deforestation is decomposed into three partial effects. First, the well-documented effect of direct land competition between rival uses arises; it increases deforestation and decreases food production. Second, an indirect displacement of food production across regions, possibly provoked by the reaction of international food prices, increases deforestation and reduces the food sector's output. Finally, labor mobility between sectors and regions tends to decrease food production but also deforestation. The total impact of ethanol production on food production is negative while there is an ambiguous impact on deforestation.","[de Sa, Saraly Andrade; Engel, Stefanie] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Palmer, Charles] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"de Sá, SA (通讯作者)，ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",saraly.andrade@env.ethz.ch,"Engel, Stefanie/B-6533-2009; Engel, Stefanie/A-7397-2009","Engel, Stefanie/0000-0002-3568-5500",ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,7,9,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Finally, this study summarizes four propositions on cash flow stability and integrated BCI and ERM, in order to keep the stability of cash flow with the lowest working capital and the optimal return for a given company.","[Fu Yuanlue] Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Ctr Accounting Studies, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,,ylfu@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,3,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5611-7073-1,,,,2012,,,,,,,436,449,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEW73,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318443600024,0

Usually, in capital budgeting process the discount rate is presented through the cost of capital. The determination of the cost of capital primarily depends on the capital structure, but since the process of capital budgeting implies a long time period, it also implies uncertainty and vagueness. Subjective perception, thinking, judgment and decision making, including a large number of predicted vague data is often expressed solely in linguistic variables by the management and this is the main characteristic of the capital budgeting process, especially in the determination of the cost of the capital through a long time period. The main intention of this paper is to present the use of fuzzy logic in the process of determining the cost of capital and providing an alternative approach in the appraisal of the cost of capital in the presence of fuzziness. The integration and implementation of linguistic variables i.e. qualitative information in the determination of the cost of capital using fuzzy numbers in the capital budgeting process will also be discussed. Through the formulation of a fuzzy system and the use of fuzzy numbers we will propose a process and methodology(*) for the use of fuzzy numbers in the process of the cost of capital determination. We examine the presented methods and suggest new ideas that could improve further research and implementation of fuzzy logic in the capital budgeting process.

The solution is given both for the general case and for cases leading to closed-form equations such as power utility and Gompertz mortality. Illustrations for a wide range of parameters indicate that starting to save for retirement in the first phase of one's career is rarely optimal. Of course, this is not to say that young workers should not save for other motives - a limitation of this model is that risks besides mortality are not considered. The conclusion should also be interpreted cautiously as it is difficult to represent every possible individual circumstance and saving incentive in a single model. The intuition behind the result is that an efficient strategy allocates the burden of financing retirement first to periods with higher income (i.e. lower opportunity costs), creating the potential for an initial period without savings when income grows.","San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Lachance, ME (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",Marie.Lachance@sdsu.edu,,,,,,,23,8,8,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

(Ministry of Agriculture, 2010) These factors are limiting the competitiveness of Czech farms. One of the ways how to combat these disadvantages is to invest to the modernisation of the agricultural sector, support innovations and their transmission into practice. Czech Republic can benefit from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) under established Rural Development Programme (RDP). First priority axis of this program is devoted to increasing of competitiveness of agriculture and forestry. Measure I.1.1 Modernisation of agricultural holdings is aimed on investment promoting and improving the overall performance of the farm to increase its competitiveness. Measure I.1.2 Increasing of the economic value of forests has the same objective, but aims on forestry companies. The mid-term evaluation of the RDP evoked the question if the subsidised investments had contributed to the introduction of new products or services and technologies by the enterprises. The aim of this article is to answer the question if the subsidies on modernisation from the EU's funds have statistically significant impact on the introduction of new technologies or products by agricultural holdings and thus enhancing their competitiveness. On the basis of performed statistical hypothesis testing, the author came to the conclusion that subsidies into modernisation of the agricultural and forestry holdings statistically significantly contributed to the introduction of new technologies and innovations.",,,,,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,112,116,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800008,0

The entrance into a different market is accompanied by an adjustment to a different group of consumers, which necessitates the exploration of consumers' information needs regarding quantity and quality of Fair Trade-products. In this study, coffee as a popular Fair Trade-product was exemplary chosen in order to explore the task. As a survey method, an Information Display Matrix (IDM)-experiment was chosen in order to be able to trace the information acquisition behaviour and the final purchase decision. IDM experiments are suited to sequentially trace information search. The IDM was accompanied by a complementary questionnaire; both survey methods were conducted computer assisted. Results show that among the tested product attributes, product price, production methods, Fair Trade-label and the ethical attribute 'protection of children' were most important. Consumers are also willing to pay a higher price for a product which fulfills their requirements of a Fair Trade coffee. With regard to information acquisition behaviour, results show that consumers perform a rather extensive information search and apply strategic approaches, whereof attribute-based strategies are most popular.","[Schleenbecker, Rosa; Hamm, Ulrich] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Schleenbecker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",r.schleenbecker@uni-kassel.de,"Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013; Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020",,,,,,20,0,0,0,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2370-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2012,,,,,,,373,382,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BA8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338038800026,0

The firms in oligopolistic industries are assumed to exercise market power in the tradable permit market as well as in the product market. Specifically, we examine the effects of the initial permit allocation on the equilibrium outcomes, focusing on the interaction among these product and permit markets. It is shown that raising the number of initial permits allocated to one firm in an oligopolistic industry increases the output produced by that firm. Under certain conditions, raising a clean (less-polluting) firm's share of the initial permits can lead to reductions in both the product and permit prices. We discuss criteria for the socially optimal allocation of initial permits, considering the trade-off between production inefficiency and consumer benefit.","Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Tanaka, M (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",mtanaka@grips.ac.jp,"Tanaka, Makoto/M-9489-2014","Tanaka, Makoto/0000-0002-8606-865X",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22530220] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,20,5,7,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Nevertheless, it is commonly believed to be an implicit inflation targeter. The evolution to inflation targeting occurred because central banks, most importantly the Federal Reserve, demonstrated that monetary policy could control inflation. As central banks' credibility for keeping inflation low increased, policy actions became increasingly focused on affecting the growth rate of employment or the unemployment rate. The author argues that this change in emphasis is unlikely to generate positive benefits; more importantly, it endangers the continued effectiveness, and perhaps even the viability, of inflation targeting.

The main idea is that after the employees complete the online questionnaire the manager can receive a complete report about the answers, underlyining the weaknesses and strengths of the organizational culture according to the answers. This evaluation is very important because they can compare the results with other companies in the field and can discover opportunities for competitive advantage. After this phase of the research if the manager wishes we can provide him with a set of strategies to mend the problems, the weaknesses. This step is very important because many researches regarding organizational culture just diagnose the type of culture but do not offer solutions for the problems. Along with the comparison regarding the strengths and weaknesses in the organizational culture the authors propose a comparison regarding financial performance indicators.

Applying the behavioral theory of the firm, this study empirically examines the effect of family ownership on the breadth, depth, and speed of organizational learning. Each of these dimensions can influence entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the effect of ownership on organizational learning depends on family cohesiveness, the extent to which members of the owner family feel closeness, mutual solidarity, and the desire to stick together. Data from 741 firms show that family ownership is positively associated with the breadth and speed of learning but is negatively associated with the depth of learning. Though cohesiveness does not alleviate the negative effect of family ownership on the depth of learning, it amplifies the effect of family ownership on the breadth and speed of learning. Organizational learning, especially its breadth and depth, positively influences the pace of family firms' entrepreneurship.","Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Gary S Holmes Ctr Entrepreneurial Studies, Dept Strateg Management & Org, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Zahra, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Gary S Holmes Ctr Entrepreneurial Studies, Dept Strateg Management & Org, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",zahra004@umn.edu,,,,,,,56,143,161,4,109,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Moreover, recent episodes showed that in front of an imminent crisis, the promise of no interventions made by governments is barely credible. In this paper we address the problem of resolving banking crises from the government perspective, taking into account the fact that preventing banking crises is crucial for the government. In addition, we introduce the moral hazard problem, inherent in the banking system, and consider the interaction between regulation, policy measures and banks' behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that compares different policy plans to resolve banking crises in an environment where insufficiently capitalized banks have incentives to take risk, and the government has to decide whether to provide public services or impede crises. We show that when individuals highly value public services then the best policy in terms of welfare is to apply the tax on early withdrawals, as the government can transfer those taxes to the whole population by investing in public services (although at some cost). Conversely, when individuals assign a low value to consuming public services, recapitalization is the dominant policy. Finally, when the probability of a crisis is sufficiently high, capital requirements should be used. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By exploiting the differential relevance of recent changes in U.S. bank resolution (i.e., the introduction of the Orderly Liquidation Authority, OLA) for different types of banks, we are able to simulate a quasi-natural experiment using a difference-in-difference framework. We find that banks that are more affected by the introduction of the OLA (1) significantly decrease their overall risk-taking and (2) shift their loan origination toward lower risk, indicating the general effectiveness of the regime change. This effect, however, does (3) not hold for the largest and most systemically important banks. Hence, the introduction of the OLA in the U.S. alone does not appear to have solved the too-big-to-fail problem and might need to be complemented with other measures to limit financial institutions risk-taking.

We find abnormal pension fund selling in small stocks with poor past performance during the final trading days in December, providing some support for the window dressing hypothesis. However, we find little evidence that institutional tax-loss selling or risk-shifting trading strategies contribute to TOY returns.

The economy faces an upward sloping supply curve of debt. In our model, households require real balances in advance for consumption expenditures, and monetary policy involves targeting the inflation rate. We show that an increase in the inflation rate leads to a decrease in the stock of foreign debt. It also leads to a decrease in consumption, employment, capital accumulation and output in the long run. Our results show that the accumulation of foreign debt exhibits non-monotonic adjustment. Particularly, an increase in the inflation rate leads to a current account surplus followed by a deficit. Along with this non-monotonicity, our model also explains the positive correlation between savings and investment during the transitional periods (Feldstein-Horioka puzzle). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Taking into account the actual prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, an augmentation of the demand for specialized medical services is expected. As this paper argues, this situation can have an important impact on medical tourism. We analyze original data on the case study of a hospital, specialized in cardiovascular treatment, in the Romanian county of Covasna, which is offering specific balneal procedures, such as CO2. hydrotherapy, alongside regular rehabilitation programs. The aim of our study is to evaluate the demographic characteristics, and the pathology of the hospitalized patients, as well as the specific rehabilitation procedures. Our findings suggest that the interest of patients, with cardiovascular diseases, for medical tourism can be influenced by accessibility, by some particularities of the location, but also by the holistic nature of the rehabilitation procedures.","[Darabont, Roxana Oana] Univ Med & Pharm Carol Davila, Bucharest, Romania; [Suceveanu, Paul; Suceveanu, Mihaela] Cardiol Hosp Dr Benedek Geza, Covasna, Romania; [Volintiru, Clara Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Volintiru, Clara Alexandra] London Sch Econ, London, England",Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Darabont, RO (通讯作者)，Univ Med & Pharm Carol Davila, Bucharest, Romania.",rdarabont@yahoo.com,"DARABONT, ROXANA/GXW-2320-2022; VOLINTIRU, Clara/AAC-2903-2019","DARABONT, ROXANA OANA/0000-0002-8231-3603",,,,,15,0,0,0,11,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2014,16.0,,,,8,,1151,1159,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS9DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344543900009,0

The findings also suggest that bank size, credit losses, and market risk significantly influence bank performance. These results are robust to various model specifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The model shows that risk interventions reduce expected costs of switching land use between cropping and noncropping activities and, hence, incentivize sodbusting. Based on data for south-central North, Dakota over 1989-2012, our simulations show that offsetting 20% of a cropping-return shortfall by a risk intervention increases the sodbusting cost threshold, below which sodbusting will occur, by 41% (or $43.7/acre). Omitting cropping-return risk across time underestimates the sodbusting cost threshold by 23% (or $24.35/acre) and hence underestimates sodbusting caused by crop production.","[Miao, Ruiqing] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA USA; Iowa State Univ, Ctr Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Miao, RQ (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,"Feng, Hongli/A-1662-2013","Feng, Hongli/0000-0001-7553-8145",Ducks Unlimited,Ducks Unlimited,"This study was partially supported by Ducks Unlimited.

This dampening of downside risk comes at the cost of underperforming during non-crisis periods. Investors seeking downside protection would value the asymmetry of these returns. This asymmetric return pattern is driven by the mutual funds that focus on environmental, social, or governance (ESG) attributes and is especially pronounced in ESG funds that use positive screening techniques. Furthermore, the observed patterns are attributed to the funds' socially responsible attributes and not the differences in fund portfolio management or the characteristics of the companies in fund portfolios.

We use daily data of the US, EU, and UK insurance sectors, covering the period from January 2004 to June 2013. We find substantial increases in dependence during the financial crisis periods. Prior to the crises, various copulas are found to best fit each pair; specifically, asymmetric tail dependence is found for the UK-US pair, suggesting the possibility of large simultaneous losses. However, during the crisis periods, the Frank copula fits best, with no significant tail dependence detected, implying low systemic risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
