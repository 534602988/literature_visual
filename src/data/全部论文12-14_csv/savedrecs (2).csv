J,"Sadorsky, P",,,,"Sadorsky, Perry",,,"Modeling volatility and conditional correlations between socially responsible investments, gold and oil",ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Socially responsible investing; GARCH; Volatility; Oil prices,STOCK RETURNS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; INVESTORS,"Socially responsible investing (SRI) is one of the fastest growing areas of investing. While there is a considerable literature comparing SRI to various benchmarks, very little is known about the volatility dynamics of socially responsible investing. In this paper, multivariate GARCH models are used to model volatilities and conditional correlations between a stock price index comprised of socially responsible companies, oil prices, and gold prices. The dynamic conditional correlation model is found to fit the data the best and used to generate dynamic conditional correlations, hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights. From a risk management perspective, SRI offers very similar results in terms of dynamic conditional correlations, hedge ratios, and optimal portfolio weights as investing in the S&P 500. For example, SRI investors can expect to pay a similar amount to hedge their investment with oil or gold as investors in the S&P 500 would pay. These results can help investors and portfolio managers make more informed investment decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Four regimes can occur, depending on the initial social cost of oil being larger or smaller than that of renewables and depending on the initial oil stock being large or small. We also offer some policy simulations for the first and second regime, which illustrate that with a lower discount rate more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. We identify the conditions under which the optimal carbon tax rises or decreases. Subsidizing renewables (without a carbon tax) induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depleted more rapidly initially. The net effect on global warming is ambiguous.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX13 UQ, England; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van der Ploeg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX13 UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,74,77,4,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

This, more realistically grounded, modeling approach furnishes theoretical support for why one encounters different numbers of lobbying firms of varying sizes in different industries, without casting the (unrealistic) lifeline of the 'money-buys-policies' assumption or (unrealistically) casting out the role of money from the lobbying process. Theoretical legs are also furnished for the empirical finding of a negative and statistically significant (at the 1% level) relationship between industry concentration and direct lobbying by the industry. Additional insights emerge from the model regarding how a cap on the lobbying-contributions of firms results, in fact, in an expansion of the amount of access-time purchased by some firms, and how a decline in the world price of an industry's good can generate greater inequality in access to politicians.","[Mayer, Wolfgang] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Mujumdar, Sudesh] Univ So Indiana, Dept Econ & Mkt, Evansville, IN 47712 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University Southern Indiana,"Mujumdar, S (通讯作者)，Univ So Indiana, Dept Econ & Mkt, 8600 Univ Blvd, Evansville, IN 47712 USA.",smujumda@usi.edu,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,7,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JAN 13,2014,8,,,,,,,,20142.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-2,0.0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1LY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339608700001,0

Probit and linear regression models with a large set of controls (to minimize any bias that may result from omitting factors related to both adolescent obesity and adult outcomes) are fitted to carry out analyses separately by gender or racial groups. Pathological body weights are most notably present among males, blacks and Hispanics, suggesting possibility that diverging obesity effects may be found across race and gender groups.

Since it implies risk, uncertainty and creativity, it is important to analyze many barriers that can harm the process so that those could be avoided or minimized. In that sense, it is important to explore the perceptions of entrepreneurs about those barriers, especially in transition countries, where entrepreneurship is found as driving force of contemporary economic development. A comparative analysis was conducted to identify the main barriers to entrepreneurship in two countries, Serbia and Montenegro, with special direction to three areas of barriers. Online questionnaire was used to identify the level of awareness of these barriers (related to social circumstances, human resources and fiscal burdens) among entrepreneurs in target areas, as part of the larger study. Online questionnaire consisting of 15 questions, divided in 3 areas, was designed in Google questionnaire, an open source based survey tool. The survey was designed to capture information on the perceived barriers in entrepreneur's business from several aspects (age, gender and education level of entrepreneurs). The questionnaire was filed by 182 entrepreneurial companies in both countries. Data analysis was made through SPSS program for statistical analysis. There were used statistical techniques: descriptive statistics, ANOVA test, t-test of independent samples to explore and confirm four proposed hypotheses. The aim of this research was to identify the most important barriers in establishing and developing entrepreneurial business in two transition countries, Serbia and Montenegro. The paper was divided into three parts. In the first part, the authors made a short theoretical overview on the literature of enfrepreneurial process and barriers related to Serbia and Montenegro. Second part was dedicated to the presentation of the methodology used for the analysis of obtained sample of enfrepreneurial companies. Third part consists of results and discussion and some authors' remarks for the future research and position of entrepreneurs in Serbia and Montenegro.","[Bobera, Dusan; Lekovic, Bojan; Berber, Nemanja] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Bobera, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia.",bobera@ef.uns.ac.rs; bojan.lekovic@ef.uns.ac.rs; berber@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Berber, Nemanja/JFS-1642-2023; Berber, Nemanja/C-8235-2018","Berber, Nemanja/0000-0002-1433-6416",,,,,41,12,14,1,49,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

While the dichotomy is consistent with social preference theory, the often advanced hypothesis that social behavior is an artifact of laboratory conditions has not heretofore been ruled out. We tested these competing hypotheses in a field experiment on eBay conducted with experienced traders. The buyer behavior we observe strongly confirms the social preference hypothesis. Also, the behavioral patterns in the field experiment mirror fully naturally occurring trading patterns in the market. For instance, some sellers do not use their commitment power as predicted by theories of both selfish and social behavior, with the pattern of deviation reflecting traders' market experience outside the experiment.

These constraints induce non-differentiabilities in policy functions. We develop an interpolation technique that addresses this problem directly: It locates the non-differentiabilities and adds interpolation nodes there. To handle this flexible grid, it uses Delaunay interpolation, a simplicial interpolation technique. Hence, we call this method Adaptive Simplicial Interpolation (ASI). We embed ASI into a time iteration algorithm to compute recursive equilibria in an infinite horizon endowment economy where heterogeneous agents trade in a bond and a stock subject to various trading constraints. We show that this method computes equilibria accurately and outperforms other grid schemes by far. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite financial subsidies, smaller practices remain reluctant to adopt these information systems. Using a nationally representative survey of physicians, this study explores the relationship between physician, practice and area attributes and the adoption of health IT systems. Controlling for these attributes, the analysis subsequently studies the relationship between health IT, physician productivity and perceived quality of care. It finds that smaller practices and physicians with lower incomes are less likely to adopt health IT systems and that adoption varies with the type of medical conditions the practice typically treats. With regards to productivity, health IT adopters are more likely to see fewer patients and spend a larger amount of time on each visit with marginal increases in time on administrative tasks and no differences in perceived ability to deliver quality health care.","[Brunt, Christopher S.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA; [Bowblis, John R.] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Brunt, CS (通讯作者)，Georgia So Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA.",cbrunt@georgiasouthern.edu,,"Brunt, Christopher/0000-0003-4760-6707",,,,,34,6,15,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Under CBA, a union chooses a pay-scale schedule and the firm can select a wage from this pay scale after observing match quality. An advantage of collective bargaining agreements is that search and business-stealing externalities can be internalized. A disadvantage is that it takes more time before an optimal allocation is reached. What the most desirable system is, depends on worker bargaining power (beta) and the relative efficiency of on- versus off- the job search. We find both for the Netherlands and the US that as long as beta lies between 0.1 and 0.7, CBA is less desirable.

A consequence of this is that the standard econometric model used for production function estimation will be misspecified. We prove that, in all nontrivial cases, finite elasticities of supply to the firm will lead to inconsistent estimates of production function parameters.

It investigates the validity of a fundamental methodological precept according to which no substantive prediction or explanation of a well-defined macroeconomic period model should depend on the real time length of the period. While this principle is basically satisfied as the period goes to zero, the impulse - response functions of the high-frequency versions can qualitatively as well as quantitatively be fairly dissimilar from their quarterly counterpart. The result proves to be robust under variations of the degree of price stickiness.

Although generally missing in the mainstream definitions, access to energy has become an increasingly important aspect of this poverty. In modern societies access to energy is a basic condition for full participation. In this context, even short-term deprivation results in serious difficulties for the people affected. In the article we discuss the concept of energy poverty (its origin and problems with definitions), and analyse empirical data indicating the scope and impacts of the problem in the Slovak Republic. We suggest possible approach to defining energy poverty and offer first empirical findings. In conclusion we discuss methodological problems with the conceptualization of energy poverty and possible definitions, and outline challenges and further research needs.","[Gerbery, Daniel] Comenius Univ, Fac Philosophy, Dept Sociol, Bratislava 81499, Slovakia; [Filcak, Richard] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Forecasting, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava; Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Gerbery, D (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Philosophy, Dept Sociol, Gondova 2, Bratislava 81499, Slovakia.",gerbery@fphil.uniba.sk; rfilcak@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,27,11,12,1,22,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

In contrary to previous papers, we restrict our analysis solely to the first two decades of transition. Using the globalization indexes published by the Swiss Economic Institute, we found strong and robust evidence of growth-stimulating effect of globalization processes, especially in social and economic dimensions. On the other hand, the role of political dimension of globalization was not found to be statistically significant in any research variant. The result, which seems to be particularly interesting, is that the development of the internet, television and trade in newspapers (the social dimension of globalization) had at least as strong positive impact on economic development in CEE economies in the first two decades of transition as the rise in international trade, growth of foreign investment, reduction of import barriers and development of a tax policy (the economic dimension).

A game-theoretic model in the style of Tarui and Polasky (2005) was analysed where the dairy industry strategically chooses to abate air emissions with technology adoption and herd size decisions while a regulator chooses a tax rate on emissions to satisfy the desires of competing interest groups. This model allows the effects of potential air emission regulation on the dairy industry to be evaluated. Results demonstrate that dairy farms react to the increased cost of air regulation by decreasing herd size rather than investing in air emission abatement technology in the short run. This suggests that incentives may need to be put in place to induce adoption in emissions abatement technology at the livestock level in the long run.,"[Hadrich, J.

However, the measure of firm size and its impact on wages was different in the two studies. Athukorala and Devadason (2012) reported that firm size had a positive and significant impact on wages of unskilled workers while Narayanan and Lia (2014) reported similar results but by using firm sales as a proxy for firm size. In this paper, we analyzed the impact of the share of unskilled immigrant workers on the wages of unskilled workers as a wholein establishments of different sizes (small, medium-sized and large) separately. This might give a clearer picture of how the share of unskilled immigrants affects the wages of unskilled workers in firms of different size groups. Since the mean wages paid to unskilled workers is likely to differ by firm size, both the sign associated with the growing share of foreign workers and the magnitude of their impact on average wage would be of interest. A large and negative impact among small and medium-sized establishments would be of greater concern to policy makers since the mean wage in the former two groups is likely to be lower than in large firms.","[Hosseini, Seyed Mehrshad Parvin; Narayanan, Suresh] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Hosseini, SMP (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",mehrshad_ph@yahoo.com; nsuresh@usm.my,"Parvin Hosseini, Mehrshad/J-9216-2019","Parvin Hosseini, Mehrshad/0000-0002-4366-7919",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-206-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,103,110,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366474600014,0

Net present value method is employed to calculate the investment return, and a mean-variance optimal adjustment and selection model is developed. To solve the proposed optimization problem with big number decision variables, a cellular binary particle swarm optimization which hybridizes cellular automation and particle swarm optimization is proposed.

Using scanner data on prices and quantities for all products sold at about 200 supermarkets over the last 10 years, we find that about one third of product replacements were accompanied by a size/weight reduction. We also find that a 1-percentage point larger size/weight reduction is associated with a 0.45-percentage point larger price decline, resulting in an effective price increase. Finally, we show that the quantities sold decline with product downsizing, and that the responsiveness of the quantity sold to size/weight changes is almost the same as the price elasticity, indicating that consumers are as sensitive to size/weight changes as they are to price changes. Our results suggest that the Japanese consumer price index may be downwardly biased rather than upwardly biased.","[Imai, Satoshi] Stat Bur Japan, Tokyo 1628668, Japan; [Watanabe, Tsutomu] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Imai, S (通讯作者)，Stat Bur Japan, Shinjyuku Ku, 19-1 Wakamatsu Cho, Tokyo 1628668, Japan.",s2.imai@soumu.go.jp,,,,,,,10,8,9,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In this paper we demonstrate that this may not hold in team settings. In the context of sequential team production with positive externalities between agents, incentive reversal might occur, i.e., an increase in monetary rewards (either because bonuses increase or effort costs decrease) may induce agents that are fully rational, self-centered money maximizers to exert lower effort in the completion of a joint task. Incentive reversal happens when increasing one agent's individual rewards alters her best-response function and, as a result, removes other agents' incentives to exert effort as their contributions are no longer required to incentivize the first agent.

The basic principle is, first, use a factor to form 10 portfolios in the t quarter, then observe the average prices and returns of the 10 portfolios for the previous four quarters and for the following four quarters as well. Samples in this study contain all stocks listed in the US from 1990 to 2010. The empirical evidence shows that the reason for the abnormal returns of value (book-to-price ratios, earnings-to-price ratios, sales-to-price ratios), scale and liquidity factors is over-reaction. Meanwhile, the reason for the abnormal returns of growth factors (return on equity, return on assets and revenue growth rate) is under-reaction. The results provide significant policy implications. The anomaly returns of the value, scale and liquidity factors last longer and are more appropriate to be employed for long-run investment while the growth factors are better suited for short-run investment. Furthermore, a more profitable stock-selection strategy can be formed by simultaneously considering the above two types of factors to capture both of these two sources of anomaly returns.","[Liu, Yi-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Int Business, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Yeh, I-Cheng] Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University; Tamkang University,"Yeh, IC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",140910@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Liu, Yi-cheng/AAO-9177-2021","Liu, Yi-cheng/0000-0003-4991-4228; Yeh, I-Cheng/0000-0002-1051-7607",,,,,24,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS, 1992) univariate test and allow for multiple structural breaks. We find that except for Burkina Faso, Burundi and Gambia, the inflation rate is stationary for the rest of the 14 countries. We then apply the panel version of the KPSS test, developed by Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005), which accounts for multiple structural breaks. We find strong evidence of panel stationarity of the inflation rate.

Applying time-series analytical mechanisms to fuel, biofuel and agricultural commodity prices and production, we estimate the long-run relationship between energy prices, bioenergy production and the global land-use change. Our results suggest that rising energy prices and bioenergy production significantly contribute to the global land-use change both through the direct and indirect land-use change impact. Globally, the total agricultural area yearly increases by 35 578.1 thousand ha due to increasing oil price, and by 12 125.1 thousand ha due to increasing biofuel production, which corresponds to 0.73% and 0.25% of the total worldwide agricultural area, respectively. Soya land-use change and wheat land-use change have the highest elasticities with respect to both oil price and biofuel production. In contrast, nonbiomass crops (grassland and rice) have negative land-use change elasticities. Region-specific results suggest that South America faces the largest yearly total land-use change associated with oil price increase (+10 600.7 thousand ha), whereas Asia (+8918.6 thousand ha), South America (+4024.9 thousand ha) and North America (+1311.5 thousand ha) have the largest yearly total land-use change associated with increase in biofuel production.","[Rajcaniova, Miroslava] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Kancs, d'Artis; Ciaian, Pavel] Commiss European Communities, DG Joint Res Ctr, Seville 41092, Spain",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG Joint Res Ctr, Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu,"Kancs, d'Artis/K-3374-2014; Rajcaniova, Miroslava/GNP-5216-2022; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Rajcaniova, Miroslava/0000-0003-4688-7690; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850; Kancs, d'Artis/0000-0002-8514-725X",,,,,39,19,20,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Dominant theories of foreign direct investment suggest the main motives to invest abroad include cost savings, search for resources, search for new markets and effort to enhance market position. We expose these motives to a statistical analysis based on data on Chinese investments in 50 African countries for time period 2003 - 2011. We use descriptive statistics based on outer terciles of sorted statistical series, pooled regression and fixed effects model.

Subjects bargain against changing opponents, with randomly drawn asymmetric disagreement outcomes that vary over plays of the game, and with complete information about disagreement payoffs and the cake size. We find that subjects only respond about half as much as theoretically predicted to changes in their own disagreement payoff and to changes in their opponent's disagreement payoff. This effect is observed in a standard Nash demand game and a related unstructured bargaining game, in both early and late rounds, and is robust to moderate changes in stake sizes. We show theoretically that standard models of expected utility maximisation are unable to account for this under-responsiveness, even when generalised to allow for risk aversion. We also show that quantal-response equilibrium has, at best, mixed success in characterising our results. However, a simple model of other-regarding preferences can explain our main results.","[Anbarci, Nejat] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Feltovich, Nick] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Deakin University; Monash University,"Feltovich, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",nicholas.feltovich@monash.edu,,"Feltovich, Nick/0000-0002-9385-7833; Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086",,,,,46,32,34,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

The transmission of values between generations,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Saving preferences; Wealth; Intergenerational inequalities,INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; WEALTH-ACCUMULATION; PREFERENCES,"The influence of parents' savings behaviour on that of their children has often been remarked. This paper attempts to explain this poids d'Anchise via a unique French dataset collected by DELTA and TNS-Sofres in 2002 (Pata,not signr survey), which contains both savings and subjective information for two or three generations of the same family. Parents' and children's risk and discounting preferences are significantly positively intergenerationally correlated. The correlation coefficients are around 0.25, so that the two preferences are nonetheless far from identical. In addition, the elasticity of children's wealth with respect to that of their parents is around 0.22. This correlation is corrected for the influence of age on wealth, and concerns only co-existing generations, that is before the most significant intergenerational transfers have taken place. The analysis of the raw correlations with a series of explanatory variables reveals that over 40 % of this elasticity can be explained by the permanent incomes of the two generations. Each of education and preferences separately account for about 20 %, and previous intergenerational transfers for about 13 %. When permanent income is controlled for, the contribution of savings preferences is around 13 %. The transmission of preferences therefore plays a non-negligible role in the intergenerational transmission of wealth inequalities, but is far from being the most important factor.","[Arrondel, Luc] CNRS PSE Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Arrondel, Luc] Banque France DEMS SAMIC, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Arrondel, L (通讯作者)，CNRS PSE Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",arrondel@pse.ens.fr,,,,,,,45,11,15,0,15,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Our theoretical analysis is an extension of Lazear's (2005) jack-of-all-trades theory in combination with the idea of bricolage of experiences and their effectuation in the disposition to become an entrepreneur. Our primary conclusion is that it is not individuals with a higher level of human or social capital but rather individuals with a more balanced and combined portfolio of human capital, social capital and experiences that are more disposed than others to become entrepreneurs. We use survey data from a sample of more than 2000 German students to test this hypothesis and find that the jacks-of-all-trades, i.e., individuals who are more balancing and combining different skills rather than specializing in a few, are more likely to become entrepreneurs.

J,"de Carvalho, FJC",,,,"Cardim de Carvalho, Fernando J.",,,Keynes and the endogeneity of money,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Keynes; post-Keynesian economics; endogeneity of money; bank money; central banks,,"A common feature of practically all strands of post-Keynesian theory is the notion that the money supply should not be considered as fixed independently of money demand in macroeconomic models. There are, however, at least two ways to postulate money endogeneity. The first, and perhaps best known today, is Kaldor's version, where the money supply curve is assumed to be horizontal at a given interest rate level. Kaldor's approach focuses on the means-of-payment function of money, stating that money is created when firms and individuals plan to acquire goods and services and borrow from banks the necessary amount of money to do it. Kaldor's emphasis is laid on central banks' behavior, assumed to be entirely accommodating of commercial banks' demands for the reserves required to satisfy the demand for bank loans. Keynes's version, based on his Treatise on Money and other essays, focuses on money in its liquid-store-of-wealth function. To propose that money is the most liquid asset in an entrepreneurial economy rules out the possibility of accepting a horizontal money supply curve, as it is shown in the paper. In fact, the first and most important contrasting concept in Keynes's approach in comparison to Kaldor's is the notion of liquidity. Keynes proposes a hierarchical view of liquidity, while Kaldor views liquidity as a flat' concept, where different assets exhibit different degrees of liquidity but their relationship is not hierarchical. A second contrast is that Keynes's view of endogeneity is based on a theory of how banks work instead of a theory of central banking. The paper develops Keynes's approach to money endogeneity along the lines just described and evaluates Kaldor's criticisms of Keynes's views.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"de Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,,17,5,6,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Institutional frames such as the peer-review process in academia influence the way knowledge is created. This also concerns knowledge diversity as well as knowledge similarity. Similar research activities tend to generate related knowledge, reduce the costs of its economic exploitation while increasing the costs of duplicate research; a high degree of knowledge diversity impedes its prompt economic exploitation but enhances long-term economic growth. A simple model substantiates this tradeoff and serves as the basis for a general reflection on institutional frames in basic science. A Monte-Carlo simulation delivers structural equilibria subject to knowledge overlaps among researchers induced by institutional frames. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The initial focus was on revealing which paradigm fits best for a given dataset, while later studies have looked at variation in decision rules across respondents within a dataset. However, only limited effort has gone towards understanding the potential drivers of decision rules, i.e. what makes it more or less likely that the choices of a given respondent can be explained by a particular paradigm. The present paper puts forward the notion that unobserved character traits can be a key source of this type of heterogeneity and proposes to characterise these traits through a latent variable within a hybrid framework. In an empirical application on stated choice data, we make use of a mixed random utility-random regret structure, where the allocation to a given class is driven in part by a latent variable which at the same time explains respondents' stated satisfaction with their real world commute journey. Results reveal a linkage between the likely decision rule and the stated satisfaction with the real world commute conditions. Notably, the most regret-prone respondents in our sample are more likely to have aligned their real-life commute performance more closely with their aspirational values. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To substantiate the distinction between necessities and luxuries, already Ernst Engel (1895) approached a behaviorally founded comprehensive assessment of structural changes in consumer expenditures. To build upon Engel's legacy and to complement the scarce empirical literature, a behavioral approach is applied. It is conjectured that differences in satiation patterns of universally-shared needs translate, on the aggregate level, into different shapes of Engel curves and thus also into different income elasticities of demand. Utilizing nonparametric regression techniques, it is explored whether and which expenditure categories change systematically with rising income. In line with the theoretical expectations, a number of empirical regularities in consumer expenditure patterns can be identified that go well beyond Engel's law. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

First, we review answers to the most fundamental question in the theory of sovereign debt: given that there is no supranational institution for enforcing the repayment of debts, why do countries ever repay their debts? Second, we review theories of the process by which sovereign debts are restructured with a view to answering the following question: why does the process of sovereign debt restructuring appear so inefficient? The first question raises issues in the design of self-enforcing contracts and on the credibility of threats to punish a country in default. The second question involves applications of the theory of bargaining in environments where the parties to a bargain cannot commit to honour the terms of the bargain or even commit to enter into negotiations in the first place.","[Pitchford, Rohan] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wright, Mark L.

Data from 1997 to 2009 reveal that both increased exposure to multinational firm exports in related industries and expansion in private firm imports at the broad industry level contributed to private firm export growth. The benefits of multinational exposure are particularly strong for consumer goods, and the benefits of private firm provincial imports are most strongly linked to private firm exports of capital goods and intermediate inputs. In contrast, special economic zones and technology zones did not increase private firm exports. Further investigation of the export transaction data at the product level suggest that Chinese private firm export capability was increased by (1) improvements in product quality that was fostered by proximity to multinational firms; and (2) improved access to imported intermediate inputs.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Swenson, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",dswenson@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,87,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Based on a Heckman two-step procedure combining first differencing and instrumental variable regression techniques, it is found that FDI has had a positive impact on the export value of domestic firms mainly through backward technology spillovers and a positive impact on the export-to-sales ratio of domestic firms through horizontal export-related information spillovers. After decomposing FDI by different market orientation and domestic firms by different ownership, the paper finds that the positive impact on domestic firms' export values is mainly from the nonexporting and the exporting foreign-invested enterprises while the positive impact on domestic firms' export-to-sales ratios is mainly from the high-exporting foreign-invested enterprises. Both types of export spillovers are mainly diffused to domestic non-state-owned enterprises.","[Findlay, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Chen, Chunlai] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Sheng, Yu] Nankai Univ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",University of Adelaide; Australian National University; Nankai University,"Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",christopher.findlay@adelaide.edu.au,"Sheng, Yu/ABC-2411-2020; SHENG, Yu/GXZ-8269-2022",,,,,,26,35,37,2,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

For instance, this allows to study situations where the influence process is based on majorities, which are not covered by the classical approach of weighted averaging aggregation. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence to consensus and characterize outcomes where the society ends up polarized. Our results can also be used to understand more general situations, where ordered weighted averages are only used to some extent.

Basically, decoupling seems to comprise three sub-hypotheses: (i) growth spillovers from advanced countries to EMEs decreasing progressively in importance, (ii) business cycles in EMEs becoming less synchronized with those of the advanced world and (iii) strengthening of growth spillovers and cyclical synchronization among the EMEs as a group. The received literature fails to distinguish adequately between the trend and cyclical aspects of the decoupling relationship. We resort to two frequency domain methods (nonstationary spectral causality testing and wavelet correlations), which seem to offer a neat separation of trend and cyclical decoupling. Based on a sample of seven EMEs from the Asian region (including the two large EMEs - China and India), we uncover strong evidence favouring both trend and cyclical decoupling.","[Nachane, Dilip] IGIDR, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India; [Dubey, Amlendu Kumar] Indian Inst Management Indore, Econ Area, Indore, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore,"Nachane, D (通讯作者)，IGIDR, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",nachane@igidr.ac.in,,,,,,,41,11,11,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration was applied to examine long run relationship among the series while stationarity properties of the variables was tested by applying structural break test. Our empirical evidence confirmed long run relationship among the variables. The results showed that energy use, financial development, capital, exports, imports and international trade have positive impact on economic growth. The Granger causality analysis revealed that unidirectional causal relationship running from energy use to economic growth. Financial development and energy use Granger cause each other. There is bidirectional causality between international trade and energy use. The feedback relation exists between financial development and international trade. There is also bidirectional causality exists between capital and energy demand, financial development and economic growth and, international trade and economic growth.

We find that despite the possibility of its evasion a tax on initial wealth should supplement the optimal nonlinear income tax, given a positive correlation between initial wealth and earning abilities. Further, even if income and initial wealth are taxed optimally, it is still desirable to levy a tax on commodities, though it can be evaded as well. Thus, our result provides a rationale for a comprehensive tax system. Optimal tax rates on commodities differ in general, however for the special case of a uniform evasion technology equal rates are optimal if preferences are homothetic and weakly separable.","[Brunner, Johann K.; Eckerstorfer, Paul; Pech, Susanne] Univ Linz, Dept Econ, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Brunner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",johann.brunner@jku.at,,,,,,,23,1,1,1,16,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Our estimated models suggest that if Medicare could eliminate the systematic biases inherent its payment formula, it would see a net improvement to access to care under Medicare Part B.","[Brunt, Christopher S.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Jensen, Gail A.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Econ, Inst Gerontol, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; Wayne State University,"Brunt, CS (通讯作者)，Georgia So Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, POB 8152, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",cbrunt@georgiasouthern.edu; gail.jensen@wayne.edu,,"Brunt, Christopher/0000-0003-4760-6707",,,,,26,5,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The model builds on the assumption that organizational structures have an impact on the nature of spillover effects between teaching and research competencies. We analyze the dynamic equilibrium under unilateral and bilateral spillovers, using the no-spillover case as a benchmark. The bilateral spillover case is the most appealing as it achieves the highest overall performance; however, the nature of the equilibrium and the career paths can be quite different depending on the parameters of the problem such as the obsolescence of competencies or the strength of the spillover effect.

Banks obtain loans in an over-the-counter market (involving search, bilateral matching, and negotiations over the terms of the loan) and hold assets of heterogeneous quality that in turn determine their ability to repay those loans. When asset quality is not observable by outside investors, information about the actions taken by a bank in the loan market may influence prices in the asset market. In particular, under some conditions, borrowing from the central bank can be regarded as a negative signal about the quality of the borrower's assets and banks may be willing to borrow in the market at rates higher than the one offered by the central bank.

Third, we examine the effects of major banking policies on financial inclusion across states in India during 1972-2009, using panel data econometrics techniques. We find that the social-banking policy has played crucial role to foster financial inclusion across states in India during 1977-1990.

The Argentinean Convertibility was interpreted by the conventional view as a pure case of the Mundell-Fleming model with fixed exchange rate (MFFER). This approach points out that domestic money became 'endogenous' because the central bank loses the ability to determine the monetary policy. However, this last endogenity process has nothing to do with the heterodox endogenous money approach. While the MFFER endogeneity is 'supply-led' (balance of payment effect), the heterodox approach is 'demand-led' (bank credit effect). So, given the structural external constraint (not only due to the historical Argentinean balance of payments constraint, but also increased by the need for backing the monetary base with foreign reserves) the Central Bank of Argentina operated as a lender of last resort to an unsustainable expansion of public foreign indebtedness. The dollar credit rationing to the government was the limit to the central bank's accommodation policy.",,,,,,,,,,,33,5,5,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Using a panel of infants and toddlers from the Birth cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-B), this paper attempts to provide causal estimates by leveraging heretofore unrecognized seasonal variation in child care participation. Child assessments in the ECLS-B were conducted on a rolling basis throughout the year, and I use the participation dip among those assessed during the summer as the basis for an instrumental variable. The summer participation dip is likely to be exogenous because ECLS-B administrators strictly controlled the mechanism by which children were assigned to assessment dates. The OLS results show that children utilizing non-parental arrangements score higher on tests of cognitive ability, a finding that holds after accounting for individual fixed effects. However, the instrumental variables estimates point to sizeable negative effects of non-parental care. The adverse effects are driven by participation in formal settings, and, contrary to previous research, I find that disadvantaged children do not benefit from exposure to non-parental care.

The introduction of real wage rigidities plays a important role to resolve main shortcomings of the standard new Keynesian small open economy model. The main findings regarding the issue of monetary policy design can be summarized as three fold. First, the optimal policy is to seek to minimize variance of domestic price inflation, real wage inflation, and the output gap if both domestic price and real wage are sticky. Second, controlling CPI inflation directly or indirectly induces relatively large volatility in output gap and other inflations. Therefore, both CPI inflation-based Taylor rule and nominal wage-inflation based Taylor rule are suboptimal. Last, a policy that responds to a real wage inflation is most desirable.

This study aims to test geographical framing and substitution effects in stated choice experiments by first increasing and subsequently reducing the geographical scale and associated set of choice alternatives in the experiment. Geographical framing effects are tested by comparing estimated choice models for differently sized choice sets. Testing these framing effects related to choice set size helps to inform decisions on choice set composition. The results indicate that changing the choice set size has little to no effect on preference parameters and estimated WTP values. However, the larger choice set is associated with higher error variance, suggesting higher choice task complexity. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes that many behavioral investments represent more compound risk for poorer people-who often face multiple dimensions of deprivation-than for richer people. As a result, identical aversion to compound lotteries can prevent investment among poorer people, but have no effect on richer people. The paper reports five studies: two initial studies that document that aversion to compound lotteries operates as an economic preference, two laboratory experiments in the field in El Salvador, and one Internet survey experiment in India. Poorer Salvadoran women who choose a compound lottery are 27 percentage points more likely to have found formal employment than those who chose a simple lottery, but lottery choice is unrelated to employment for richer women. Poorer students at the national Salvadoran university choose more compound lotteries than richer students, on average, implying that aversion to compound lotteries screened out poorer aspirants but not richer ones. Poorer and lower-caste Indian participants who choose compound lotteries are more likely than those who choose simple lotteries to have a different occupation than their parents, which is not the case for better-off participants. These findings suggest that the consequences of aversion to compound lotteries are different in the context of poverty and disadvantage.","Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Princeton University,"Spears, D (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",dspears@princeton.edu,,,,,,,29,6,7,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper analyses the ratings' exit patterns from the RN using a hazard regression framework. We hypothesise that similar to civilian workers, job transition decisions of the RN ratings are dependent upon alternative job availability and macroeconomic conditions. In addition, working conditions, gender and skill mix, family commitments and promotion prospects in the Navy influence their decisions to leave early. We estimate the unemployment elasticity for males to be -0.65 (female -0.51), which is high, compared to the elasticity reported for the US Navy. The civilian wage is positively related to exit probability from the RN. Overall, married ratings are less likely to exit as compared to their unmarried counterparts, but married female ratings are 88% more likely to leave early as compared to unmarried females in the Navy.

We build a new dataset for the 1990-2005 period with fiscal, political and socio-economic variables. Since democracy is a complex and multidimensional concept, we measure it using two variables, the political strength of democratic institutions, and the protection of civil liberties. We perform three sets of estimates: (i) cross-country pooled OLS regressions with region fixed effects, (ii) country fixed effects regressions and (iii) region specific regressions with country fixed effects. While the first model delivers some significant correlations between political variables and tax items, when controlling for country fixed effects we find that tax revenue and tax composition are in general not significantly correlated with the strength of democratic institutions and the protection of civil liberties. The only exceptions are indirect, trade and property taxes. A similar result applies to public spending, with the exception of defense expenditure. Overall, our findings cast some doubt on the exact public policy channels through which political institutions affect economic development. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (3) (2013) 684-718.

This is the tragedy of the anticommons'. We analyse the robustness of such result when competition is introduced for one or both complements. Particularly, competition in only one of the two markets may be welfare superior to an integrated monopoly if and only if the substitutes differ in their quality so that, as their number increases, average quality and/or quality variance increases. Then, absent an adequate level of product differentiation, favouring competition in some sectors while leaving monopolies in others may be detrimental for consumers and producers alike. Instead, competition in both markets may be welfare superior if goods are close substitutes and their number in each market is sufficiently high, no matter the degree of product differentiation.","[Alvisi, Matteo; Carbonara, Emanuela] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Carbonara, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, 2 Piazza Scaravilli, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",emanuela.carbonara@unibo.it,,"ALVISI, MATTEO/0000-0003-1607-1009",,,,,28,4,4,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Using the case study of the Balearic Islands (Spain) from January-1999 to December-2010 results from a partial adjustment model show a relatively low price-elasticity, evidencing how the internalizing mechanism that could be argued for introducing the tax in order to reduce transport externalities does not work.

We show that the dominant firm's quantity is (weakly) increasing in its quality if and only if its marginal cost (weakly) exceeds that of the fringe; otherwise it is strictly decreasing in quality. This result is driven by the fact that a quality increase causes the marginal revenue curve to rotate clockwise, rather than shift outwards, and at a height equal to the fringe firms' marginal cost. This fact, combined with the dominant firm's MR = MC condition, determines the result. For closely related reasons, the effect of a quality increase on consumer welfare also depends on the relationship between the costs. It is possible that all consumers are (weakly) better off, that some are better off and some worse off, or that all are (weakly) worse off.

However, when allowing for cross-industry effects of offshoring, i.e. allowing for labor mobility across industries, negative wage effects of offshoring are quite substantial and depend strongly on the task profile of workers' occupations.

During a steep price upswing, however, shifts in positions in the futures markets by well informed optimizing agents that usually dampen price changes, result in destabilizing positive feedback trading. Futures price changes that can be classified as speculative are due to destabilizing hedgers' reactions to movements in the variability of the return of their covered cash position.

In times of peace, agents belonging to two groups are randomly matched to trade bilaterally. Trade hinges on trust and cooperation. The onset of conflict signals that the aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate, harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history of conflicts and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars are persistent. Moreover, even accidental conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a society into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs. Coercive peace policies, such as peacekeeping forces or externally imposed regime changes, have no enduring effects.","[Rohner, Dominic; Thoenig, Mathias] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zilibotti, Fabrizio] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; University of Zurich,"Rohner, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Rohner, Dominic/0000-0003-2660-4550",,,,,83,64,79,2,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Multistep family of the General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models are used for this end, whereby volatility shocks obtained from the mean equation estimation in each market are included in the conditional volatility of the other market, respectively. The paper selects the appropriate volatility models for each market following criteria such as covariance stationarity, persistence in variance and leverage effects. The finding of the paper indicates that there is a unidirectional relationship in terms of volatility spillovers from the equity market to the foreign exchange market. The paper supports the view that the extent of foreign participation in the South African equity market possibly contributes to this phenomenon.","[Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo; Hoveni, Jamela] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Bonga-Bonga, L (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",lbonga@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,39,9,14,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Using data from input-output tables of 21 European countries from 1995 to 2006 we decompose an offshoring index, distinguishing between a domestic (structural change) and an international component (imported inputs ratio). Regarding offshoring of business services, a large share of the index variation is driven by the domestic component. This is even more pronounced for overall service offshoring. In the case of material offshoring, by contrast, the international component drives the main variation of the indices. Our results therefore show that, regarding (business) services, the typical calculation of offshoring indices tends to over estimate the role of the imported inputs component, neglecting the role played by structural changes in the economy.

Nonetheless, in the absence of absolutely riskless fiat money and excluding resorting to redistributive fiscal policies that would make it possible to attain the first-best steady state, this best monetary steady state can be implemented as a competitive equilibrium with the adequate policy of taxes on returns to capital, subsidies to returns to monetary savings, and lump-sum transfers.

Others argue that managerial power has increased in a way that allows those at the top to receive higher pay, that social norms against higher pay levels have broken down, or that tax policy affects the distribution of surpluses between employers and employees. We offer evidence bearing on the different theories explaining the rise in inequality in the United States over recent decades. First we look the increase in pay at the highest income levels across occupations. We consider the income share of the top 1 percent over time. And we turn to evidence on inequality of wealth at the top. In looking at the wealthiest Americans, we find that those in the Forbes 400 are less likely to have inherited their wealth or to have grown up wealthy. The Forbes 400 of today also are those who were able to access education while young and apply their skills to the most scalable industries: technology, finance, and mass retail. We believe that the US evidence on income and wealth shares for the top 1 percent is most consistent with a superstar-style explanation rooted in the importance of scale and skill-biased technological change.

Two-sided platforms are common. However, if a two-sided platform involves network effects, so that participants on one side of the platform care about the number of participants on the other side of the platform, it is a two-sided market. These markets raise a variety of important issues for economists and policy-makers.

Based on survey results, numerous and detailed Russian standards on imported dairy products are considered by respondents as redundant and unnecessary from a food safety perspective. Conformity assessment procedures are identified as a major problem when exporting to Russia. They are non-transparent, time-consuming and expose exporters to significant risk that their products may be refused entry at the Russian border. Audits by Russian inspectors seem to be subject to arbitrary rules and exporting companies face great uncertainty because of unclear and often changing rules. Both fixed and variable costs may increase due to Russian non-tariff measures, adding an estimated 510% of export value to costs. The gravity model estimates indicate that, after controlling for other variables, non-tariff measures are more restrictive on US exports to Russia than on EU exports to Russia, while New Zealand's exports to Russia are least affected by NTMs. Overall, the estimates do not confirm that Russia's NTMs are significantly more restrictive than is the case with other countries' NTMs. Although Russian standards for dairy imports are inhibiting trade they are not more restrictive than those implemented by other countries.","[Pokrivcak, Jan; Drgova, Lenka; Mraz, Marian] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia; [van Berkum, Siemen] LEI Agr Econ Res Inst, The Hague, Netherlands; [Ciaian, Pavel] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Wageningen University & Research,"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",pavel.ciaian@ec.europa.eu,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Van Berkum, Siemen/0000-0002-0248-8033; Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850",,,,,33,6,7,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN 1,2013,25,2,,,,,175,189,,10.1080/14631377.2013.787737,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,137XY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318472900003,0

The empirical literature firmly established a positive correlation between technology indicators and demand shifts. In the minds of many, that has established a causal relationship. This leap of faith, however, is at odds with Hicks's conventional wisdom that endogenous technological change will be biased toward using cheap and abundant resources. In addition, if the rate of technical change is considered to be endogenous, the assumption of an exogenous bias toward skilled labor should at least be questioned. Two hypotheses explaining endogenous skill bias in technical change have been suggested in the theoretical literature: the acceleration effect and the market size effect. In this paper these are studied in a single endogenous-growth model to derive the sufficient and necessary conditions for both hypotheses. After confronting these conditions with the evidence, the paper concludes that it strongly favors the acceleration hypothesis.","[Sanders, Mark] Utrecht Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Sanders, M (通讯作者)，Utrecht Sch Econ, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.w.j.l.sanders@uu.nl,,,,,,,80,3,3,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper argues that traditional measures cannot fully capture the essence of an inherently multidimensional and job-specific concept such as skill mismatch. An empirical job-based methodology is proposed that classifies the types of skill (mis)matches based on performance of core skills and supplementary skills. The proposed methodology is tested on a sample of 600 Portuguese retail bankers. The results support the job-specific nature of skills. The differentiated distribution of skill (mis)match by job is a significant determinant of earnings among the sampled retail bankers.,"[Sgobbi, Francesca] Univ Brescia, DIMI, I-25121 Brescia, Italy; [Sgobbi, Francesca; Suleman, Fatima] DINAMIA CET, Lisbon, Portugal; [Suleman, Fatima] Inst Univ Lisboa, ISCTE IUL, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Brescia; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Sgobbi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, DIMI, I-25121 Brescia, Italy.",,"Suleman, Fátima/AAG-1548-2020","Suleman, Fatima/0000-0002-5963-2892; SGOBBI, Francesca/0000-0002-6623-1376",,,,,42,13,17,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

It finds that growth is predominantly wage-led in both the United States and the Eurozone, although it is profit-led in some European Union countries. Profit-led growth may flourish under austerity measures, whereas wage-led growth requires economic stimuli (and reforms) to address an economic downturn. The dominant policies of addressing the great financial crisis currently are austerity measures to deleverage balance sheets, incidental interventions to save banks, and market reforms. However, these policies ignore the effects of the functional distribution of income on growth and are not likely to turn the tide in economies where growth is wage-led.

The crux of this approach is the recognition that an understanding of the evolutionary origins of human organizational capabilities can inform theories of contemporary economic organization. Modern firms sustain large scale cooperation by applying cultural 'work-arounds' to tribal instincts that evolved from simultaneous within-group and between-group competition on a much smaller scale.

Nevertheless, the TYDL causality test suggests that there is only a unidirectional causality running from stock prices to economic growth. Moreover, the recursive regression-based TYDL causality test affirms that this unidirectional causality is stable over their respective period of analysis.

When humans moved into settled communities, with more advanced means of production, the nature of fear much like the nature of social relationships - changed. Once the means of social reproduction were secured, fear became less necessary as a survival instinct, and more useful as a heuristic device. Fear cannot be characterized as an essentially socially constructed phenomenon, or as the self- contained, individualized response to internalized traumas. The growth and nature of fear must be studied as a process that develops under its own inertia and as a phenomenon that is both shaped by and shapes its institutional setting. Fear should be understood as both structurally determined and socially transformative.

Under demand uncertainty, equilibrium unit price declines and approaches towards marginal cost as the seller becomes more risk averse. Marginal-cost pricing prevails, irrespective of the seller's risk attitude, if clients are homogenous. Under cost uncertainty, unit price is higher than marginal cost and monotonically increases in risk aversion. The model is then extended to accommodate buyers' risk aversion and it is found that demand uncertainty makes unit price decline in the seller's risk aversion again but increase in buyers' risk aversion.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Yin, XK (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Finance, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",x.yin@latrobe.edu.au,,"Yin, Xiangkang/0000-0002-7031-414X",,,,,25,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

I estimate the parameters of the extended model, using a social network of citations among high-energy physics papers, and find that the extended Jackson-Rogers model can parsimoniously fit the degree distribution of each age cohort.

A decomposition analysis shows that the strong increase in the exporter wage gap, conditional on workers' skill levels, contributed to the growth in wage inequality, whereas the increase in the exporters' share in total employment worked towards a reduction in wage dispersion. The resulting net contribution is positive (inequality-increasing) but moderate. These findings are consistent with recent heterogeneous-firm trade models that feature an exporter wage premium as well as variability of the premium with respect to increasing trade liberalisation.

Using a principal-agent model, this paper investigates the incentive effects of bonus taxes by analyzing the agent's and principal's behavior. Specifically, we show how bonus taxes affect the agent's incentives to exert effort and the principal's decision regarding the composition of the compensation package (fixed salary and bonus rate). We find that, surprisingly, a bonus tax can increase the bonus rate and decrease the fixed salary if the agent is highly risk averse. Additionally, a bonus tax can induce the principal to pay higher bonuses even though the agent's effort unambiguously decreases. Nevertheless, a bonus tax reduces the overall salary of the agent. Further results are derived with respect to the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for a general effort cost function. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Notches create excess bunching on the low-tax side and missing mass on the high-tax side of a cutoff, and they are often associated with a region of strictly dominated choice that would have zero mass in a frictionless world. By combining excess bunching (observed response attenuated by frictions) with missing mass in the dominated region (frictions), it is possible to uncover the structural elasticity that would govern behavior in the absence of frictions and arguably capture long-run behavior. We apply our framework to tax notches in Pakistan using rich administrative data. While observed bunching is large and sharp, optimization frictions are also very large as the majority of taxpayers in dominated ranges are unresponsive to tax incentives. The combination of large observed bunching and large frictions implies that the frictionless behavioral response to notches is extremely large, but the underlying structural elasticity driving this response is nevertheless modest. This highlights the inefficiency of notches: by creating extremely strong price distortions, they induce large behavioral responses even when structural elasticities are small.

Under gaizhi, insiders could acquire their firms at a price that was based on recent profitability. This gave the managers of firms an incentive to reduce short run profits. We compared the performance of firms acquired by their managers to performance at matched control firms. Insider controlled firms experienced a significant decrease in profitability immediately prior to privatization and a return to pre-gaizhi profits soon thereafter. The short term reduction in profits was accompanied by a decrease in labor productivity, an increase in overdue accounts receivable, and an increase in R&D investment. We do not observe a similar pattern among firms acquired by outsiders. These findings suggest that insiders intentionally suppressed the performance of their firms so as to acquire them at less than fair value. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (2) (2013) 634-650.

Personalized-price equilibrium outcomes are independent of premuneration values and exhibit inefficiencies only in the event of coordination failures, while uniform-price equilibria depend on premuneration values and, in general, feature inefficient investments even without coordination failures. There is thus a trade-off between the costs of personalizing prices and the inefficient investments under uniform prices.

The seller chooses an information system which allows the buyer to receive a private signal, potentially correlated with her valuation. No restrictions are imposed on the conditional distributions of the signal; the cost of the information system is proportional to its precision, measured by the mutual information between the distributions of the buyer's valuation and the signal. In equilibrium, the information system trades off the information cost against the losses deriving from a probability of trade that is either too high, or too lowaEurodepending on the relative weight of the expected losses resulting from errors of the two types-and sends non-neutral signals, typically. Thus, in general, the probability of a correct signal depends on the buyer's actual valuation, and the probability of trade differs from the probability of a valuation exceeding the cost of production. The expected total surplus generated by the exchange is maximized, in equilibrium.","Jonkoping Int Business Sch, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Manduchi, A (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",Agostino.Manduchi@jibs.hj.se,,,,,,,34,1,2,0,15,SPRINGER WIEN,Vienna,"Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, A-1040 Vienna, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Focusing on the period between 1960 and 2011, the methodology implemented allows for a clearer understanding of the drivers of the real estate market in boom, steady-state and crash regimes. Our results show that the sensitivity of the real estate market to economic changes is regime-dependent. The paper then proceeds to examine whether policymakers are able to influence a regime switch away from the crash regime.

Inflation forecasts are not unique. Central banks and professional organizations generate inflation forecasts while households are surveyed about their inflation outlook.

I find that central bank transparency tends to increase forecast disagreement. To the extent this reflects the attention paid to inflation performance the implication is that transparency is beneficial.

That prediction turned out to be a pretty good description of monetary policy in the 1980s, 1990s, and until recently. Because this balanced international picture has largely disappeared, the 1980s view about monetary policy coordination needs to be reexamined. The source of the problem is not that the models or the theory are wrong. Rather there was a deviation from the rule-like monetary policies that worked well in the 1980s and 1990s, and this deviation helped break down the international monetary balance. There were similar deviations at many central banks, an apparent spillover culminating in a global great deviation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible causes and consequences of these spillovers, and to show that uncoordinated responses of central banks to the deviations can create an amplification mechanism, which might be overcome by some form of policy coordination.

That is, a promotion and, in particular, the wage increase associated with a promotion is a prize that serves as an incentive for workers to exert effort and take other actions beneficial to the firm such as the accumulation of human capital. In this paper I consider whether the best way to model promotion tournaments is by having firms commit to prizes ex ante as in Lazear and Rosen's initial formulation, or whether promotion prizes should be modeled as arising from the signaling role of promotions and the competition between firms for promoted workers.

This paper in addition takes into account competition in the second product market and then re-examines how intra-brand and inter-brand product differentiations affect the incentive to bundle. In order to formally examine the above conjectures, this research builds up a two-firm, two-product model in which product 1 (monopoly product) is produced only by the bundling firm and product 2 (competing product) is produced by both firms. The analysis shows that under both Bertrand and Cournot competitions the incentive to bundle does not necessarily increase with the degree of intra-brand differentiation, while it strictly decreases with the degree of inter-brand differentiation. Moreover, under Bertrand competition bundling always decreases consumer surplus, but may increase the competitor's profit and social surplus. Under Cournot competition bundling always reduces the opponent's profit and social welfare, but may increase consumer surplus.","[Chung, Hui-Ling; Lin, Yan-Shu] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Hualien 97401, Taiwan; [Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Dong Hwa University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Lin, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 2,Da Hsueh Rd Shoufeng, Hualien 97401, Taiwan.",ylin@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,"Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935",,,,,21,19,24,0,55,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We apply the Nash, the Egalitarian and the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solutions in the small firm's matching model of unemployment. First, we show that the Egalitarian and the Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions are easily implementable within search-matching economies. Second, our results show that even though the traditional results of bargaining theory apply in the context of search-matching economies, they are quantitatively weaker than expected compared to the results established in the earlier literature. In addition, and excluding a model with on-the-job search, it appears that the policy implications of labor taxes and employment protection are not very sensitive to the choice of the bargaining solution.

This essay explains why this conclusion may be incorrect; because it ignores politics, this approach is oblivious to the impact of the removal of market failures on future political equilibria and economic efficiency, which can be deleterious. We first outline a simple framework for the study of the impact of current economic policies on future political equilibria - and indirectly on future economic outcomes. We then illustrate the mechanisms through which such impacts might operate using a series of examples. The main message is that sound economic policy should be based on a careful analysis of political economy and should factor in its influence on future political equilibria.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,73,127,136,7,86,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Given the great variability and large jumps in both spot and futures prices, considerable care is required when processing the relevant data and accounting for the costs of maintaining and re-balancing the hedge position. We find that the variance reduction produced by all models is statistically and economically indistinguishable from the one-for-one naive hedge. However, minimum-variance hedging models, especially those based on GARCH, generate much greater margin and transaction costs than the naive hedge. Therefore we encourage hedgers to use a naive hedging strategy on the crack spread bundles now offered by the exchange; this strategy is the cheapest and easiest to implement. Our conclusion contradicts the majority of the existing literature, which favours the implementation of GARCH-based hedging strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Both trends impacted family income inequality. However, this paper's analysis of Australian data shows that the impact of women's earnings on family income inequality changed over the study period of 1982 to 1995-1996. During the same time frame, the growth in women's earnings was concentrated in households with high male earnings, pushing family income inequality higher. However, after 1995-1996, the growth in women's earnings had a moderating influence on family income inequality as it was concentrated in households with lower male earnings. These findings contribute new evidence on the importance of trends in family formation and the correlation of husbands' and wives' earnings to the evolution of family income inequality. The evidence is also suggestive of a dynamic relationship between rising family income inequality and women's participation in paid work that echoes Thorstein Veblen's ([1899] 2008) ideas regarding the importance of relative income and emulation.","[Austen, Siobhan] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Redmond, Gerry] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Social & Policy Studies, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Curtin University; Flinders University South Australia,"Austen, S (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",,"Redmond, Gerry/B-4104-2013; Shaheem, Yasmine/A-8703-2018","Shaheem, Yasmine/0000-0001-5375-981X; austen, siobhan/0000-0002-2367-0889; Redmond, Gerry/0000-0001-6440-4416",,,,,43,6,6,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

At the same time, such inferences are important in many applications, not least because they have structural interpretations and provide useful inferences and structural explanation for the strength of any interactions. In this paper we propose GMM methods designed to uncover underlying (hidden) interactions in social networks and committees. Special attention is paid to the interval censored regression model. Small sample performance is examined through a Monte Carlo study. Our methods are applied to a study of committee decision making within the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee.","[Bhattacharjee, Arnab] Univ Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Holly, Sean] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Dundee; University of Cambridge,"Bhattacharjee, A (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, 3 Perth Rd, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",a.z.bhattacharjee@dundee.ac.uk; sh247@cam.ac.uk,,"Bhattacharjee, Arnab/0000-0003-1300-0838",,,,,59,25,26,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

It argues that consumption externalities can provide rationale for government intervention in education. Within the context of overlapping generations economy, it has also been shown that competitive equilibrium either underaccumulates both physical and human capital or overaccumulates both. Thus the result rules out the possibility of competitive equilibrium deviating from the social optimum in its allocation of physical and human capital in opposite directions.

We investigate this question by examining behavior in an experiment where subjects repeatedly play a two-player binary trust game. Players are randomly and anonymously paired with one another in each period. The main questions addressed are whether a social norm of trust and reciprocity emerges under the most extreme information restriction (anonymous community-wide enforcement) or whether trust and reciprocity require additional, individual-specific information about a player's past history of play and whether that information must be provided freely or at some cost. In the absence of such reputational information, we find that a social norm of trust and reciprocity is difficult to sustain. The provision of reputational information on past individual decisions significantly increases trust and reciprocity, with longer histories yielding the best outcomes. Importantly, we find that making reputational information available at a small cost may also lead to a significant improvement in trust and reciprocity, despite the fact that most subjects do not choose to purchase this information.","[Duffy, John] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Xie, Huan] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Lee, Yong-Ju] Samsung Res Inst Finance, Seoul, South Korea",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Concordia University - Canada; Samsung,"Xie, H (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",jduffy@pitt.edu; huanxie@alcor.concordia.ca; yj0612.lee@samsung.com,"Duffy, John/F-6968-2015","Duffy, John/0000-0002-7660-2281; Lee, Yong-Ju/0000-0003-1221-9934",,,,,23,31,32,2,57,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

While accepting the validity of that law, it shows that the conventional measures of labour productivity used in the literature may be rather misleading, because they are based on monetary aggregates. Theoretically and empirically sounder measures are provided by standard Marxian real labour values. The notion of labour content and the LDLC are therefore central to understanding capitalist economies. Some rigorous theoretical relations between different forms of profit-driven technical change and productivity are derived in a general inputoutput framework with fixed capital, and these provide foundations to the LDLC. These theoretical propositions are empirically illustrated using a new dataset of the German economy.","[Flaschel, Peter] Univ Bielefeld, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany; [Franke, Reiner] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Veneziani, Roberto] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of Bielefeld; University of Kiel; University of London,"Flaschel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, POB 10 01 31, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",p.flaschel@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,,40,13,13,4,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A new tool in the input-output context that allows us to reveal the functioning economic structure by determining the structural equivalent sectoral groups is proposed. The aim is to outline a new approach to clustering sectors based on similarities between sector linkages profiles. The obtained set of structurally equivalent sectors defines a reduced model which provides additional information about the main paths of influence and the degree of complexity. The structural equivalent sectors of Spain in 2000 and 2005 are determined. The Spanish economy has evolved to a more connected and oriented-service economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate little scope for measurement error. However, they also reveal a strong cross-section price effect, which proves robust to a variety of checks. The effect of price heterogeneity proves critical in identification of the scale estimates, providing relatively rare empirical evidence consistent with the Base Independence (BI) hypothesis. The BI food share estimates of cost of children have plausible values.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Koohi-Kamali, F (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",fkkecon@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In comparison with established market economies we find relatively high probabilities of retirement that decline with age. This unusual pattern can partly be attributed to weak incentives to work, inherent in the design of the pension system and reflected in predominantly negative values of accruals, and to transition-specific increase in wage inequality in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is reflected in low wages and relatively high pensions of less productive (skilled) workers and vice versa. We find that the probability of retirement decreases with option value of work and net wages, although the response to the former, when controlling for the latter, is rather weak. Our results also imply that less educated individuals and individuals with greater personal wealth are more likely to retire.","[Polanec, Saso; Ahcan, Ales; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Verbic, Miroslav] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Verbic, Miroslav/0000-0001-5506-0973",,,,,41,8,8,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,MAR 1,2013,25,1,,,,,99,118,,10.1080/14631377.2013.756703,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,083GU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314451900006,0

In this setup, if the government is forced to keep budget balance in every period, then it may not be able to sustain zero capital taxes in the long run, as shown in Benhabib and Rustichini (J Econ Theory 77:231-259, 1997) and Phelan and Stachetti (Econometrica 69:1491-1518, 2001). However, (Dominguez in J Econ Theory 135:159-170, 2007) shows that if the government is allowed to borrow and lend to households, the optimal capital income tax still converges to zero in the long run, as long as the value of defaulting is independent of the level of government debt. This paper provides a game theoretic setup with government debt where the value of the worst equilibrium only depends on the initial level of capital and can be determined in advance. This implies that under our assumptions the best sustainable equilibrium has zero capital taxes in the long run, even in the absence of government commitment.","Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CATOLICA LISBON, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Reis, C (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CATOLICA LISBON, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal.",creis@clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt,,"Reis, Catarina/0000-0002-6138-6790",,,,,12,8,8,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

To deal with the endogenous input problem, we used the semi-parametric regression techniques for estimating the firm-level TFP. The results suggest that firms' TIP in China's iron and steel industry has been steadily increasing over time with the key drivers of productivity improvement differing substantially between firms with different characteristics including their size, ownership type and geographical location. Notably, the productivity of small firms is positively related to market share and negatively related to R&D. Large state-owned enterprises' productivity is relatively insensitive to changes in market share and R&D, while the non-state owned enterprises are more likely to obtain their productivity gains through export. Increasing firm size is generally positively correlated to firms' performance in TFP, and it is more so in the less developed Western than the Eastern and Central regions. The findings suggest that different policy instruments targeting firms with different characteristics in the process of restructuring the industry may be desirable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This paper offers a twofold contribution to the empirical debate on the financing of innovation. First of all, it provides a comprehensive descriptions of possible simultaneous patterns which may affect a firm's relevant dimensions, namely innovation inputs, innovation output, leverage and profitability. By using a Granger-Causality framework we will show that a firm's leverage does not cause innovation output, as proxied by a measure of a firm's successful innovation, while it is rather caused by successful innovation and a firm's operating profitability. The second contribution is an original investigation of the determinants of a firm's capital structure based on a panel of Italian firms which links the third Community Innovation Survey with an administrative data source providing economic and financial information collected from balance sheets and income statements referring to the period 1996-2003. This paper provides support for the pecking order theory as our firms are less indebted when operating profitability increases, but the use of external funding increases with their innovative effort. We also find support for the existence of credit constrains which seem to affect small innovative firms when compared with larger enterprises.","[Bartoloni, Eleonora] ISTAT, Natl Inst Stat, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Bartoloni, Eleonora] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Bartoloni, E (通讯作者)，ISTAT, Natl Inst Stat, Via Porlezza 12, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",bartolon@istat.it,"BARTOLONI, Eleonora/ABI-8204-2020","BARTOLONI, Eleonora/0000-0001-7720-4309",,,,,42,44,50,3,84,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2013,40,1,,,,,111,151,,10.1007/s10663-011-9179-y,0.0,,,41,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,074CW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313791100005,0

Studies of both pricing and non-price decision variables are considered. In general, it is found that crude oil prices are the primary driver of national price movements over time. However, market structure has been identified as playing a role in price dynamics, equilibrium selection and price differentials across markets and stations. The economic literature emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity across stations and coordination problems faced by retailers. Several directions for future work are suggested, including the development of theory and demand estimation using high-frequency station level data.","Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Alberta,"Eckert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada.",,,,,,,,136,78,87,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

It works in settings with linear policy rules and in settings in which equilibrium cannot be supported by linear rules. The instantaneous-gratification model also generates a unique equilibrium, even in infinite-horizon applications, thereby resolving the multiplicity problem hitherto associated with dynamically inconsistent models.

The major reason for the presumed shortcomings is found in the overly restrictive assumption of a retention ratio equal to unity. However, in the alternative model presented by Sasaki and Fujita either perfect capital gains have to be assumed or firms have to be allowed to issue equity in the accumulation process.

The burgeoning democratic peace literature has provided strong empirical evidence for the claim that democracies are a cause of peace. However, several skeptics of the democratic peace have suggested that the statistical findings are spurious. We test these competing claims using a simultaneous equation model. Using a unique data-set of all international disputes from 1960 to 1988, we find strong support for reciprocal causation. As the democratic peace theorists claim, democracy causes peace even after controlling for military conflict in the system and region.

Gender-targeted job ads are common, favor women as often as men, and are much less common in jobs requiring higher levels of skill. Employers' relative preferences for female versus male workers, on the other hand, are more strongly related to the preferred age, height, and beauty of the worker than to job skill levels. Almost two thirds of the variation in advertised gender preferences occurs within firms, and one third occurs within firm*occupation cells. Overall, these patterns are not well explained by a firm-level animus model, by a glass-ceiling model, or by models in which broad occupational categories are consistently gendered across firms. Instead, the patterns suggest a model in which firms have idiosyncratic preferences for particular job-gender matches, which are overridden in skilled positions by factors such as thinner labor markets or a greater incentive to search broadly for the most qualified candidate.","[Kuhn, Peter] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; National Bureau of Economic Research; Xiamen University,"Kuhn, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"SHEN, KAILING/F-8617-2016; DENİZ, Derya Nur/D-7867-2015; SHEN, KAILING/GMW-4499-2022","SHEN, KAILING/0000-0001-6685-1850; SHEN, KAILING/0000-0001-6685-1850",,,,,27,98,122,21,168,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,,,Q J ECON,Q.

We limit our sample to this period in order to exclude the effect of the global financial crisis on production performance of the banking industry. Moreover, 2004-2008 is an important period because during this time frame, Romania was being considered for membership to European Union and for that reason Romanian authorities implemented a set of mandatory legislative improvements that accelerated the path towards market economy. We develop a two-stage empirical model that involves estimating bank performance in the first stage and assessing its determinants in the second one. In order to measure the productivity growth of the banking industry, we calculate Malmquist productivity growth index using a non-parametric linear programming approach. Our results suggest that during the period under study, the privately-owned banks in Romania have been significantly more efficient and have enjoyed a higher productivity growth compared with the state-owned banks. Results of this research may offer directions to banking regulators for institution of suitable policies for encouraging banks to employ more efficient production practices and to supply high quality services at the lowest costs possible. The policy implication of our findings are a) Romanian banking firms should alter their input mix to reduce operational costs in order to enhance their efficiency and b) Romanian government authorities need to design regulatory acts to promote mergers and acquisition among banks to assist them to improve their overall efficiency by expansion and achieving optimal size.","[Andries, Alin Marius; Stoica, Ovidiu] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Mehdian, Seyed] Univ Michigan, Flint, MI 48502 USA",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan Flint; University of Michigan,"Andries, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",alin.andries@uaic.ro; seyed@umich.edu; ostoica@uaic.ro,"Stoica, Ovidiu/H-8419-2013; Mehdian, Seyed/AAC-4057-2022; Andries, Alin Marius/B-5980-2011","Stoica, Ovidiu/0000-0003-2475-5750; Andries, Alin Marius/0000-0002-4415-4197",,,,,25,5,6,0,36,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In our model, holding domestic government nominal debt provides a hedge against shocks to bond returns and the impact on taxes they induce. For this result, only two features are essential: nominal risk and taxes only on domestic agents. A third feature explains domestically biased equity holdings: government spending falls on domestic goods. Then, an increase in government spending raises the returns on domestic equity, providing a hedge against the subsequent increase in taxes.

The measurement literature has made important contributions identifying elements of institutional design that establish the relationship between the central bank and the government and the measurements from an ordinal perspective provide some useful insights about the major institutional redesigns of central banks during the past several decades. At the same time, the measurement literature is problematic. First, a dummy variable bifurcating central banks into groups of independent and less independent central banks can duplicate the standard correlations suggesting the information content of the specific measures is limited; second, the correlations between inflation and measures of independence are not as stable as claimed; and most important, the measurements are subject to classification problems that have not been fully appreciated. Review of the institutional design and history of the Bank of Korea, Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve provide evidence the classification problems are important. The measures of independence are more appropriately regarded as ordinal rankings of central bank independence rather than considered cardinal measures suitable for econometric modeling.

The GMM turns out to be the most appropriate among the three alternative methods. Following our hypothesis, group-affiliated firms are found to have lower leverage than the stand-alone firms. Managers of group-affiliated firms seem to prefer equity as high leverage increases its bankruptcy risk. Also, firms are forced to cut capital requirements and R&D investments in order to service debt payments, damaging their long-run efficiency and competitive position. From our analysis the conclusion that follows for the policy makers is that although group-affiliation is considered to be beneficial for emerging economies like India in some earlier studies (Khanna & Palepu, 2000a), they ignored other dimensions of firm performance such as optimization of capital structure.

In the long run, the results show that the index of the insurance sector which sells the long term CDS contracts has the highest adjustment, while the banking sector is not error correcting. In the short run, although the insurance sector CDS spread index has general predictive power of all sector CDS spreads, the evidence suggests that the banking sector particularly leads the financial services and this in turn leads the insurance sector, implying a leading sector CDS pricing role for the banking spreads in the short run. The short run sensitivity Generalized Impulse Response Function (GIRF) and Generalized Variance Decomposition (GVDC) analyses also demonstrate that the sectors' credit risk responds more to credit events in the banking sector than in the other two sectors other than their own over a 50 day horizon. However, the lowest cross sector CDS shock impacts in the short run come from the insurance sector.

We employ the adjusted pricing error from an equilibrium international asset pricing model as a proxy for market integration. The aggregate country-level price delay serves as an inverse measure of informational efficiency, as it captures the relative speed with which each aggregate stock market reacts to global common information. Using data from 49 countries, we find robust evidence supporting the hypothesis that markets more integrated with the world are also more efficient, and this positive association is only significant in the sub-sample of emerging stock markets.

The aim of paper is to evaluate impact of central bank independence on the primary budget deficits in the case of OECD member countries in 1990-2012 according methodology of Lucotte (2009). The results of empirical part of the paper concludes that more independent central bank can positively influence budget deficits and that higher central bank independence can contribute to grater fiscal discipline of policymakers. In the case that central bank has only one main aim this fact supports lower possibility of misusing monetary policy for short-term monetary aims. More disciplined fiscal policy can finally help to avoid another budget crisis which are current problem of many developed economies.","[Janickova, Lenka; Baranova, Veronika] Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ekon Fak, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Janícková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ekon Fak, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",lenkajanickova@vsb.cz; Veronika.baranova@vsb.cz,"Nálepová, Veronika/S-3472-2019; Dimitriou Janickova, Lenka/HTL-8390-2023","Nálepová, Veronika/0000-0002-9881-885X; Dimitriou Janickova, Lenka/0009-0000-5059-8272",European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),This research was supported by the European Social Fund within the project CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.,,22,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,65,74,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200007,0

The hypotheses tested regarding the causality process are the following: at regional level, economic growth causes structural changes in employment; structural changes in employment boost the economic growth or there is a mutual conditioning (a feedback relation). We tested the robustness of these hypotheses by using the panel data analysis and we found that growth causes structural changes in total regional employment and for regional activities in manufacturing, real estate activities, wholesale and retail, education, mining and quarrying, financial intermediation and insurance, health and social assistance, administrative services, construction. Further, we reject the hypothesis that structural changes in regional employment cause regional GDP to grow. We also found that there may be an asymmetry between the effect induced by economic growth and recession-induced effect on the intensity of structural changes in regional employment.","[Jula, Dorin] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Jula, Dorin] Ecol Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Jula, Nicolae-Marius] Univ Nicolae Titulescu Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Ecological University of Bucharest,"Jula, D (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",dorinjula@yahoo.fr; mariusjula@yahoo.com,"Jula, Nicolae Marius/A-9011-2012; JULA, Dorin/JKI-6633-2023","Jula, Nicolae Marius/0000-0002-0389-165X;",,,,,18,13,13,1,23,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

This paper presents and contextualizes the methodological perspectives prevailing in the literature regarding those two concepts. In order to bring more clarity to our comprehension, an alternative approach to understanding knowledge-intensity and IC is presented challenging the prevailing methodologies in the pertaining fields. After critically addressing some fundamental contradictions identified in the literature, an alternative approach is suggested in which a dynamic and holistic approach is preferred to the prevailing one. Then, the phrase knowledge-intensity in organisations is introduced as capturing best what is implied in the concepts of knowledge-intensity before unveiling its meaning within an alternative methodological perspective.","[Khadir-Poggi, Yasmina; Keating, Mary] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Business, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Khadir-Poggi, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Business, Dublin 2, Ireland.",poggiy@tcd.ie; mkeating@tcd.ie,"Khadir, Yasmina/ITU-4124-2023","Khadir, Yasmina/0000-0002-8892-1431",,,,,31,2,2,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,516,522,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000059,0

From a methodological point of view, the dynamic panel model is used. The taxation in the model is approximated by he standard tax quota as well as by an alternative World Tax Index (WTI). The results confirm the economic theory about the negative impact of taxes on growth and show that the tax policy influences the growth the strongest with the 2 -year lag. In addition, it is shown that even with a lag of three years, the effects are still very strong and thus the horizon of fiscal policy is rather between 2-3 years. This is also confirmed for the particular types of taxes with the exception of VAT that exhibits no lags in the effect on growth.","[Kotlan, Igor; Machova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kotlán, I (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",igor.kotlan@vsb.cz; zuzana.machova@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",VSB - Technical University SGS [SP2013/176],VSB - Technical University SGS,This paper was financially supported within the VSB - Technical University SGS grant project No. SP2013/176 The Impact of Corporate Taxation on Selected Sectors of the Czech Republic.,,51,2,2,1,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,126,139,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200013,0

As business operations consists of purposeful execution of technologies with appropriate social cooperation and coordination, knowledge in use is actually cross-disciplinary irrespective of domain or discipline of business. As information technology infiltrates today's businesses, people would need to work smarter using technologies including information technologies. This study explores executives' perceptions of cross-disciplinary knowledge in coming era of smart businesses. An instrument was developed, asking questions about relative weights of different cross-disciplinary knowledge, frequencies and necessity of cross-disciplinary training, decision criteria in recruiting new employees and in promoting existing employees, and preferences in cross-disciplinary curriculum and sequence of relevant training courses. Results indicate that executives maintain high opinions concerning the value of science and technology as a critical contributor to the successful cross-disciplinary operation of their businesses. They seem to understand clearly that science and technology may not benefit their businesses unless it is applied in a cross-disciplinary manner. Executives prioritize cross-disciplinary knowledge domains as follows in order of importance: (1) Science Technology Enterprise (STE); (2) Science Technology Society (STS); and (3) Science Technology Humanities (STH).

Also, literature on benchmarking in the public sector appears to be less organized and orderly than literature on benchmarking in the private sector. This article bridges this gap in order to answer the question can benchmarking function as efficiently and effectively in the public administration sector as in any private sector organization by showing how governments have been able to utilize benchmarking in order to improve their performances. The use of series of benchmarks can help in making a solid base for factual approach to decision making with regard to setting specific targets for performances of the public administration system, its reform and modernization, and monitoring progress over time.

In particular, it focuses on the role of the technical innovations associated with information and communication technologies (ICT). The paper points to three main findings. First, neutral technical change is the main determinant of the US aggregate fluctuations, and its contribution remained constant throughout the postwar sample. Second, the importance of ICT increased significantly during the last decades of the considered sample, which nowadays is responsible for approximately 1/5 of GDP fluctuations. Third, the variance reduction of exogenous shocks typically associated with the last decades of the postwar sample, mainly comes from ICT and neutral shocks, whereas the volatility of innovations in traditional capital remained relatively stable. Overall, we conclude that attention should be focused on identifying those incentives behind the adoption of knowledge and technology, an issue related to the neutral progress, rather than the quality or technology embedded in capital goods such as ICT assets.","[Molinari, Benedetto; Rodriguez-Lopez, Jesus] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville 41013, Spain; [Torres, Jose L.] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, Malaga 29013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad de Malaga,"Rodríguez-López, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Ctra Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jrodlop@upo.es,"Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021; Molinari, Benedetto/ABF-6822-2021","Molinari, Benedetto/0000-0002-6212-2412; Torres, Jose L./0000-0002-7469-5656; Rodriguez Lopez, Jesus/0000-0002-2482-2346",,,,,23,2,2,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We do not have to appeal to exogenous liquidity constraints to generate asset prices that are consistent with the following facts: (i) fiat money can be valued despite being dominated in its rate of return; (ii) real assets with identical dividend flows can have different rates of return; and (iii) an increase in inflation raises asset prices, lowers their returns, and widens the rate-of-return differences between assets. On the normative side we show that there is a range of inflation rates that implement the first-best allocation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Managerial decision making is focused on creating value for stakeholders through competent uses of capital and accurate disclosure and communication of a firm's resources. However, established management and reporting systems gradually lost their relevance due to their incapability to capture and provide important information for stakeholders in order to manage processes that are based on knowledge and intangible resources. Besides, it has been claimed that in the present knowledge economy, Intellectual Capital (IC) is a major driver of competitive advantage, innovation, and performance due to its ability to capture information which is not reported in traditional financial statements. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore through empirical analysis the impact of Corporate Governance on IC disclosure (ICD) in annual reports issued by the banking sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The present study examines the influence of Corporate Governance indicators (bank size, leverage, profitability, board size, and ownership structure) as independent variables on the disclosure of IC elements (Human Capital, Relational Capital, Structural Capital) as dependent variables, while controlling for market listing age and bank age. The methodology employed is quantitative, using multivariate regression analysis to study the relationship between Corporate Governance indicators and ICD, which is measured using content analysis of the 2010 annual reports of publicly listed banks in the UAE. The present research has some limitations, which include the specificity of Corporate Governance proxies used, examination of only the 2010 annual reports, and generalization restriction inherent in the examination of the UAE markets alone. The present study has a theoretical implication, by providing an empirically tested conceptual model on the relationship between Corporate Governance and ICD in the banking sector of the UAE. In addition, it has a practical implication by providing information for regulating agencies to develop regulations aiming to increase the implementation of Corporate Governance practices incorporating IC elements.","[Ramadan, Muhieddine] Univ Wollongong Dubai, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Business Adm, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Majdalany, George] UGSM Monarch Business Sch Switzerland, Fac Accounting & Finance, Dept Business Adm, Hagendorn Zug, Switzerland",University of Wollongong,"Ramadan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong Dubai, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Business Adm, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",mzr@eim.ae; george.asaad.majdalany@ugsm-monarch.ch,,,,,,,43,5,6,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,351,361,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000040,0

Our concern is when the dependent variable and/or covariates are unobserved for some sampling units. A supplementary random sample of observations on all covariates may be available. The key insight of this paper is the recognition of non-response as a modification of choice-based (CB) samples. Semiparametrically efficient generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation appropriate for CB samples is then adapted for the non-response framework considered in this paper.

The favorable time-series properties of fractional Brownian motion exhibiting long-range dependence came along with an apparently insuperable shortcoming: the existence of arbitrage. Within the last two years, several new models using fractional Brownian motion have been published. However, still the problem remains unsolved whether such models are reasonable choices from an economic perspective. In this article, we take on a straightforward mathematical argument in order to clarify when and why fractional Brownian motion is suited for economic modeling: We provide a fractional analog to the work of Sethi and Lehoczky (1981) thereby confirming that fractional Brownian motion and continuous tradability are incompatible. In the light of a market microstructure perspective to fractional Brownian motion, it becomes clear that the correct usage of fractional Brownian motion inherently implies dynamic market incompleteness. Building a bridge to application, we show that one peculiar, but nevertheless popular result in the literature of fractional option pricing can be well explained by the fact that authors disobeyed this need for compatibility.

This article presents empirical evidence showing that job tenure increases the probability of upward occupational mobility more if individuals are undereducated. Moreover, the probability of finding upward occupational mobility is increased by overeducated workers engaging in firm switching.

This article explores the policy of increasing the generosity of UI during recessions using a model that accounts for the insurance and moral hazard implications of UI as well as the program's impact on job creation. When limited to adjusting the duration of benefits, a more generous UI system is optimal. However, due to UI's negative impact on job creation and the increased cost of providing benefits when unemployment is high, the optimal extension is just 1.3 months. When the government adjusts both the benefit amount and its duration, the optimal policy during downturns is a reduction in the replacement rate. This mitigates the decline in job creation and funds a UI extension of 4.3 months.","Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",Loyola University Maryland,"Schwartz, J (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 4501 N Charles St,Sellinger 315, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",jsschwartz1@loyola.edu,,,,,,,39,5,6,0,8,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Mergers do not bring about synergies or cost savings, but do allow firms to share their market demand information. We find that under Cournot competition, mergers without synergies could increase expected consumer surplus and social welfare, provided that market volatility is sufficiently large. The parameter spaces in which mergers are beneficial to consumers and society widen when products are more differentiated. In contrast, under Bertrand competition, mergers are always welfare reducing regardless of the degree of market volatility and extent of product differentiation. The driving force for the contrasting results lies in opposing welfare effects of information sharing in the contexts of quantity and price setting.","[Shieh, Shiou; Huang, Chi-Fei; Chen, Hsiao-Chi] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Shieh, S (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",sshieh@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; chifei.huang@gmail.com; hchen@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

According to the literature, the effect of a merger or acquisition on an acquiring firm's productivity is small. We examine the extent to which self-selection of M&A contributes to the weak M&A effect. Using data on Japanese electronics firms from 1989 to 1998, our empirical analysis shows that without controlling for the self-selection of M&A, M&A have a weak or insignificant effect on total factor productivity (TFP), as suggested in the literature. However, controlling for self-selection reveals a positive and large effect on productivity. We find a negative correlation between M&A decisions and TFP caused by self-selection, which makes the M&A effect appear negligible when it is not controlled for. These results suggest that M&A served as an effective device for improving the productivity of the electronics firms in our sample. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It's widespread to distinguish human capital (knowledge, skills of employees etc.), structural capital (business-processes, innovations, corporate culture etc.) and relational capital (brand, reputation, relationships with customers etc.). The literature supports the significance of intellectual capital influence on company's value creation. Researchers find a strong dependence of corporate performance on intellectual assets in different countries and economy branches. But their findings about a character of intellectual capital transformation in corporate value are ambiguous. Importance of human, structural and relational capital and interrelationships between them vary highly across papers. It may be explained by high firm specificity of corporate value creation. It doesn't mean impossibility of intercompany research but requires a comparability of analyzed firms. Empirical researches on the theme of intellectual capital are often limited to particular country and industry. This restriction makes investigated companies more comparable. But we suppose there is a lot of other significant aspects of firm specificity that may impact on transformation of intellectual assets into corporate value such as firm size, amount of intangible assets, total firm efficiency etc. These variables are sometimes considered as additional factors of corporate value. But we suppose these criteria may define the model of corporate value creation in principle. This study is targeted to reveal some main types of companies and investigate a specificity of corporate value creation model for each of them. We expect to discover significant differences in models mostly related to importance and significance of particular intellectual assets. This paper is empirical and quantitative. Our sample embraces about 200 large public European industrial companies from 7 countries (Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Finland, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) for 2005-2009 years. The database includes: 1. Information from financial statement. The source is Amadeus database (Bureau Van Dijk). 2. A set of nonfinancial proxy indicators (quantitative and qualitative) displaying a state of human, structural and relational capital. This data has been collected from open Internet sources such as companies' sites. Methodology of the research combines statistic methods (cluster analysis and factor analysis) and econometrics (regression analysis). Clustering distinguishes some main types of companies. Factor analysis constructs integral indices for human, structural and relational capital on the base of initial proxy set. Regression is an instrument of modeling the corporate value creation. We found significant differences between models of corporate value creation. Human, structural and relational capitals differently transform into firm value in each type of companies. Our findings have some practical implications. For example prioritizing investments in intellectual assets should take into account a firm's specificity more deeply.

In this article, I assess the economic value of this strategy by comparing the estimated option value that consumers assign to provider choice to the negotiated discounts that insurers can achieve by negotiating with a restricted set of providers (i.e., volume discounts). Using a panel of federal employees' health plan choices from 1999 to 2003, I show that the practice of selective contracting (SC) with a limited set of hospitals reduced health maintenance organization (HMO) plans' expected utility by $62$118, on average, for a standard reduction in the provider choice set. I also conduct simulations which show that by 2003 health plans using SC were theoretically unable to achieve sufficiently large volume discounts from hospital providers to fully compensate for the associated utility losses. My results help to explain the flight from HMO enrollments that occurred in the early 2000s.

Its distinguishing feature is both offshore trading at exchange rates that are market determined and onshore trading at exchange rates anchored at the official spot rate with capital account inconvertibility. We note that thus far the CNH and CNY spot rates have largely tracked each other, suggesting that the shadow price on the convertibility constraint onshore and also the offshore diversification benefit is close to zero. However, this could change in the future. We discuss the potential for the offshore RMB market to grow with trade settlement and bilateral swap arrangements in RMB, which would provide a big enough pool of liquidity for the RMB to become a vehicle currency and reserve currency. These potential developments will be restrained by onshore inconvertibility, but moving to convertibility seemingly implies major change in China's financial structure and the offshore RMB arrangements are only a small first step along this path. Crucial in this evolution of arrangements will be future Chinese growth performance and the relative attractiveness of onshore inconvertible but offshore marketable RMB relative to the debt laden and slow growth currencies of the USA, the EU and Japan.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada.",jwhalley@uwo.ca; hchen269@uwo.ca,,,,,,,23,9,10,1,52,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2013,21,1,,,,,26,46,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12007.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,073MO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313747300002,0

We empirically distinguish between true and spurious long memory characteristics by analysing different types and measurements of volatility, utilising different sampling frequencies and evaluating different financial markets. Because it is well known that long memory characteristics observed in data can be generated by either non-stationary structural breaks or slow regime-switching models, we additionally assess how the results of the analyses change during crisis periods by considering the effects of the US subprime mortgage crunch. The results support the presence of long memory characteristics that vary for diverse types and measurements of volatility, different financial markets, and distinct sampling periods, such as the pre-crisis and crisis periods.

The empirical model includes market and domestic work as separate alternatives to schooling in a trivariate probit framework, allowing also for combinations of these activities as well as idleness. This differentiation sheds new light on gender differences in the work-school decisions in North India. While more traditional determinants (like wealth or parental education) mostly affect the trade-off between schooling and the gender specific work activity (market work for boys and domestic work for girls), monetary incentives (wages and schooling costs) are more closely related to market work for both sexes. Girls are also more likely to work for the market if their economic contribution can be made within the family (for instance if the household owns animals). Proxies for cultural factors turn out to play especially a role for participation in the gender non-specific work activities; for instance, overall female labor force participation shifts girls' activities from domestic towards market work.","Univ Freiburg, Dept Int Econ Policy, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Kis-Katos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Int Econ Policy, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",krisztina.kis-katos@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,"Kis-Katos, Krisztina/ABC-3624-2021","Kis-Katos, Krisztina/0000-0003-2459-1274",,,,,47,4,5,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The estimated effects of caregiving may be affected by selection, with the health of grandparent affecting the likelihood of undertaking caregiving. The health effects of caregiving also likely differ according to the cultural motivations for caregiving by grandparents. This paper assesses whether selection into caring for grandchildren affects the estimated effects of caregiving on the health of Taiwanese grandparents. We used four waves (1993-2003) of the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan to estimate the effect of grandparent caregiving on self-rated health, mobility, and depression. To control for unobserved selection into caregiving, we employed time-varying instrumental variables (the number of grandchildren and marital status of adult children) in addition to person fixed effects. After adjusting for baseline differences, caregivers had better self-rated health, fewer mobility limitations, and fewer depressive symptoms compared to the non-caregivers, which suggest evidence of health improvement for grandparents. Instrumental variable analysis showed that caring for grandchildren was endogenously determined with grandparents' mobility limitations, and grandparent caregivers benefited from a significant reduction in the number of mobility limitations. Our finding suggests that caring for grandchildren can be beneficial for the health of Taiwanese grandparents and supports our hypothesis that a culturally expected role of caregiving results in role enhancement.","[Ku, Li-Jung E.] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Gerontol, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Ku, Li-Jung E.; Stearns, Sally C.; Holmes, George M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Van Houtven, Courtney H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Ctr Hlth Serv Res & Dev Primary Care,VA Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA",National Cheng Kung University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Duke University,"Ku, LJE (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Gerontol, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",eljku@mail.ncku.edu.tw; sally_stearns@unc.edu; courtney.vanhoutven@duke.edu; mark_holmes@unc.edu,"; Holmes, George Mark/A-5062-2010","Van Houtven, Courtney/0000-0002-0783-1611; Holmes, George Mark/0000-0002-6169-7847; Ku, Li-Jung Elizabeth/0000-0002-4644-8439",,,,,68,30,33,2,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We investigate the Hierarchical Package Bidding auction (HPB), the Combinatorial Clock auction (CC), and one pseudo-dual price auction (PDP) experimentally, as all these formats were used or suggested for high-stakes spectrum auctions. We want to understand the impact that different auction formats have on bidder behavior and allocative efficiency. Interestingly, we find that the main source of inefficiency in all formats is the bidders' preselection of packages, rather than their strategies or auction rules; bidders mostly preselect a small number of packages of interest early in the auction. CC achieves high efficiency and revenue in all experiments, but HPB yields similar results even in value models, where hierarchical pre-packaging is difficult. Due to their influence on the decision of the US Federal Communications Commission, we intentionally repeated a set of experiments conducted by Goeree and Holt (GH) [Games and Economic Behavior 70:146-169, 2010], and find similar aggregate results. In addition, we analyze the CC auction and find that this mechanism has advantages in environments where the auctioneers' hierarchy does not fit the bidders' preferences well. In addition to the value models with global synergies in GH, we used value models where bidders have local synergies, which play a significant role in spectrum auctions in the field and lead to different results.","[Scheffel, Tobias; Ziegler, Georg; Bichler, Martin] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Ziegler, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",scheffel@mytum.de; georg.ziegler@mytum.de; bichler@in.tum.de,,,,,,,28,22,27,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Since then, a second campaign has followed which is considered to have sent 1.8 million men into the field. Despite its experience of conflicts in recent decades (Afghanistan, two Chechnya campaigns, Ossetia, Georgia), the system for the care and psychological rehabilitation of veterans remains fragmentary. Although psychiatry has been existed for a long time in the Russian army, it has long been oriented towards the optimisation of the capacity of men rather than the care of their suffering. Psychology has emerged recently and its effectiveness is limited. Within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which has sent a number of policemen to the battlefield, psychiatry has developed in a very limited way and remains oriented toward the selection and management of the human factor (personnel), while psychology, introduced later, is still at an early stage. Several explanations are considered. First of all the non-recognition of the war and incidentally the impact of combat on men.

The present study aims to bridge this gap by examining firms in Portugal, a country at an intermediate stage of technological development. Based on 70 innovative firms, we found that whatever perspective of the OI model is considered, firms tend, on average, to share a relatively closed innovation model when compared with firms located in countries where technological development is advanced. About a quarter of the surveyed firms implemented the OI model in their innovation strategy/business, this being much more widely disseminated regarding the absorption of external knowledge/technology, with almost 40% of firms surveyed acknowledging its use in comparison with the perspective of transfer of knowledge/technology to other organisations - less than 10% provide their surplus technology to other organisations.

We introduce the Break-Down Free Generalized Minimum RESidual (BFGMRES), a Krylov subspaces method, as a fully automated approach for deriving the minimum variance portfolio. BFGMRES is a numerical algorithm that provides solutions to singular linear systems without requiring ex-ante assumptions on the covariance structure. Moreover, it is robust to illiquidity and potentially faulty data. US and international stock data are used to demonstrate the relative robustness of BFGMRES to illiquidity when compared to the shrinkage to market methodology developed by Ledoit and Wolf (2003). The two methods have similar performance as assessed by the Sharpe ratios and standard deviations for filtered data. In a simulation study, we show that BFGMRES is more robust than shrinkage to market in the presence of data irregularities. Indeed, when there is an illiquid stock shrinkage to market allocates almost 100% of the portfolio weights to this stock, whereas BFGMRES does not. In further simulations, we also show that when there is no illiquidity, BFGMRES exhibits superior performance than shrinkage to market when the number of stocks is high and the sample covariance matrix is highly singular.

These resulted from investments in minor irrigation which was stimulated by tenancy registration programs implemented by local governments.

This simple prediction has been tested in the literature using time and/or spatial variation in the US divorce legislation. In this paper, we suggest testing this hypothesis by exploiting a more radical policy change, i.e., the actual legalization of divorce. In Ireland, the right to divorce was introduced in 1996, followed by an acceleration of marriage breakdown rates. We use this fundamental change in Irish society as a natural experiment. Using families for whom the risk of marital dissolution is small as a control group, our difference-in-difference estimates suggest that the legalization of divorce contributed to a significant increase in female labor supply, occurring essentially at the extensive margin. Results are not driven by selection and are robust to numerous specification checks, including the introduction of household fixed effects and propensity score reweighting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

They argue that not only the design but also the policy mix has an important country-specific component (e.g. Hausmann, Rodrik, & Velasco, 2005; Zettelmeyer, 2006). We argue that the effectiveness of policies in promoting growth depends upon the set of structural policies implemented or already existing in the country. This paper empirically examines the role of policy complementarities in explaining economic growth from two dimensions. First, we construct a regression-based policy index in the same vein of Burnside and Dollar (2000), and we decompose this index afterwards into domestic and outward policy indices. Second, we evaluate the role of policy complementarities in the growth process by interacting our policy index with structural features of the country that affect growth. We find that human capital increase growth as expected but it is neither a complement nor a substitute of economic policy. On the other hand institutions and financial depth are complements with economic policy. This could be an explanation why some countries have stabilized their economies but they arc not growing faster, this could be due to low financial development or bad institutions.

Hardware enjoys higher barriers to entry, which the Chinese companies are increasingly reinforcing with intellectual property investments. In addition to being better integrated with the global economy, they are also buttressed by the huge domestic market. The overdependence of Indian firms on selling low-value services to a few countries and insulation from domestic demand make them vulnerable to emerging competition and international economic ill-winds.

In a simple neoclassical growth model with a single environmental externality in households' utility function and with public abatement, we characterize the condition on the parameters in preferences and in the pollution technology leading to local indeterminacy of equilibrium. Estimates of the crucial parameters of the model using data from economies that display the EKC satisfy the theoretical indeterminacy condition. We find that the presence of abatement activities is not a necessary condition for indeterminacy equilibria and hence, an EKC to arise.

We incorporate this new channel of financial contagion in the global game. Our basic assumption is that agents are overestimating the influence of negative messages they ascribe to others, and are thus acting on the basis of this perception. We resort to the psychological studies on the so-called third-person effect to justify this assumption. We show that the third-person effect is rationalizable. Our model has the feature that a crisis in a foreign country can be transmitted to the domestic country, even though there has been no changes in domestic fundamentals. Our model also provides intuitive explanations to the empirical observations that many governments have lost in a confidence game in the past crisis episodes.","[Ho, Tai-kuang; Wu, Ming-yen] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Ho, TK (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, 101,Sect 2,Kuang Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",tkho@mx.nthu.edu.tw,"Ho, Tai-kuang/AAO-8396-2020",,,,,,44,1,1,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

With an export carbon tax set at 200 yuan/t CO2, three policy scenarios were studied, where the tax revenue is: undistributed; redistributed neutrally to stimulate investment; and redistributed neutrally to stimulate consumption. According to the model, the economic and climate effects of the different policy scenarios are not particularly distinguishable. The economic impacts are slightly negative while the effect on the export structure is significant: the export of major energy-intensive products decreased and the export of certain sectors (labour-intensive or with higher value-added) increased, resulting in a cut of 3.77% in total direct CO2 emissions from exports. The revenue redistribution to stimulate consumption is shown to be the optimal scenario choice, which was confirmed by further sensitivity tests. By reviewing related WTO laws, this paper concludes that a clearly designed export carbon tax with a comparable carbon price is in China's own interest, while lessening the carbon leakage concerns of developed countries.

As inbound tourism is a way of extending the market and getting more demand to realize the implication of increasing returns, promotion can help overcome the underproduction of tourism goods. However, taxation leads to a decline in domestic residents' consumption of tourism and non-tourism goods and reduces the competitiveness of the non-tourism industry in the host country. An important result obtained is that government promotion of inbound tourism will not improve welfare unless the degree of increasing returns in the tourism industry is high enough and the national income of the foreign country multiplied by the parameter of marketing effectiveness is larger than the national income of the home country. This finding is supported by a simulation with the case of Australia. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We then construct a measure of intensity of African slavery use based on the flow of slaves received divided by historical populations. We also construct a proxy for the use of native slavery. The slavery variables are highly correlated with current levels of inequality. The correlation between our slavery use variables and inequality is stronger than that observed between inequality and development, geographic characteristics, institutional quality, and provision of public goods. The evidence suggests that use of slavery in the historical past may be an important determinant of the levels of inequality observed today across the globe.

We collected detailed demographic and financial literacy data on over 1,500 workers nearing retirement at three large companies to assess how individuals are planning for retirement. Many respondents display limited knowledge and understanding of public and company-provided retirement benefits. Controlling for basic demographics and wealth, we find that misconceptions about eligibility ages and plan generosity influence workers' expected age of retirement.

To test, we focus on rivers flowing through agricultural areas carrying sediments, chemicals, and fertilizers which are making their way into downstream rivers and lakes. We conduct a framed laboratory experiment modeling this problem: farmers decide on the usage of conservation technology to lessen impacts on the water quality (i.e. on the commons, the capacity to absorb these wastes) in downstream areas, which is more costly than the alternative intensive technology. The results confirm our hypotheses, demonstrating that Upstream Farmers who practice conservation are tempering profit maximization with empathy-based, environmentally conscious behavior. Such behavior better serves the farmers' own-interest, and also helps Downstream Water Users. Environmental economics.models need to explicitly include empathy-sympathy and the moral-ethical context it produces, providing a more scientific basis for conservation policy and programs.

Rather than considering the happiness effects at the individual level, we assess whether self-employment effects spread and impact the domestic happiness beyond the involved individuals. We distinguish a direct effect of self-employment on life satisfaction and an indirect effect through the impact of self-employment on per capita income and the subsequent impact of income on life satisfaction. Using panel data analysis for 15 OECD countries over a period of 18 years, we investigate empirically whether countries with higher levels of self-employment are happier, by disentangling the two previously mentioned effects. We remedy the potential endogeneity problem when estimating the indirect effect by instrumenting the self-employment rate. The main finding is a significant and negative direct effect which is larger in magnitude than the indirect effect, resulting in an overall negative effect of self-employment on the domestic happiness.

If worker bargaining power is strong we have a bargaining contract that is unaffected by the efficiency wage constraint.

The UE size in Taiwan from 1962 to 2003 is estimated using a cash deposit ratio (CDR) approach and a currency demand approach. The impact of an increase in the effective tax rate on UE is greater than that of a decrease. In addition, the impact on the UE is stronger for direct than for indirect taxes. The difference between upward and downward movements is significant for both indirect and direct taxes in the CDR approach.

J,"Arestis, P",,,,"Arestis, Philip",,,Fiscal policy: a strong macroeconomic role,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,fiscal policy; coordination of fiscal and monetary/financial policies,MONETARY,"Current macroeconomics, the 'New Consensus Macroeconomics', downgrades significantly the role of fiscal policy as a stabilisation instrument of macroeconomic policy. This paper argues that fiscal policy deserves to be properly upgraded. More recent theoretical and empirical developments on the fiscal policy front are closely examined. This examination reveals that these developments lead to the conclusion that fiscal policy is not as ineffective as argued by the 'New Consensus Macroeconomics' proponents. On the contrary, it has a strong macroeconomic role. It is also the case that, in view of the 'Great Recession', financial stability has been shown to be very important in economic policy but had been ignored prior to it. The paper argues strongly that fiscal policy is actually a strong macroeconomic stabilisation instrument, especially so when it is coordinated not only with monetary policy but also and closely with financial stability policies with such coordination-embracing income distribution. Fiscal policy should thereby be restored to its proper upgraded role in terms of economic policy. It is, therefore, high time economists and economic policymakers turned their attention more closely and seriously to this aspect and restored fiscal policy to its strong macroeconomic role.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ 5, E-48080 Bilbao, Spain",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,59,36,40,0,10,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Among these policies is the promotion and the institutional acknowledgement of a growing number of industrial clusters, defined as Specialised Towns, characterized by a high spatial concentration of firms producing one specific item (or a limited range of similar products). In the view of the provincial and local governments these types of industrial development programs are used to increase firm agglomerations, spatial concentration and visibility, which in turn leads to increased specialisation, industrial output, innovation and economic growth. However, little specific empirical evidence has been collected to support this view and the debate, at the national and international level, on the effectiveness of such interventions seems to be still largely ideological. The paper offers a contribution in this sense by offering a detailed description of the policy tools, by suggesting synthetic indexes to quantify policy efforts and industrial performances in Guangdong territories and by providing a first statistical analysis of these indexes.

Further, because our model uses information on labor force flows that is likely not incorporated by other forecasts, a combined forecast including our model's forecast and the SPF forecast yields an improvement over the latter alone of about 35 percent for current-quarter forecasts, and 15 percent for next-quarter forecasts, as well as improvements at longer horizons.","[Barnichon, Regis] Ctr Recerca Econ Int, Barcelona, Spain; [Nekarda, Christopher J.] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC USA",Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Barnichon, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Recerca Econ Int, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Barnichon, Regis/B-4650-2013","Barnichon, Regis/0000-0003-3967-1453; Nekarda, Christopher/0000-0002-2301-2720",,,,,46,24,32,0,16,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

This paper experimentally investigates how the decision making quality of an agent's opponent impacts learning-by-doing (LBD) and learning-by-observing (LBO) in a 2-player strategic game. Specifically, does LBD become more effective when agents face an opponent who exhibits optimal decision making? Similarly, does LBO become more effective when agents observe an opponent who exhibits optimal decision making? I consider an experimental design that enables me to measure strategic decision making quality, and control the decision making quality of an agent's opponent. The results suggest that LBD is more effective when facing an optimal decision making opponent. Whereas, LBO is, at most, marginally more effective when observing an optimal decision making opponent. The results also suggest that LBD is at least as effective as LBO at improving decision making in the 2-player game considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The novelty of the paper is to allow for asymmetry in causality by using a new test introduced by Hatemi-J (forthcoming). A bootstrap procedure is used with leveraged corrections that perform more accurately when the statistical assumptions for validity of asymptotic distributions are not fulfilled. This is especially the case for sample sizes as in the current paper. The estimation results reveal strongly that a negative energy consumption shock will cause a negative shock in the output per capita. That is, if the energy utilization per capita decreases then the output per capita will also decrease. Surprisingly, such a causal impact for positive shocks is not found. These empirical results might indicate that there is an optimal quantity of energy in the US that needs to be consumed as otherwise the economic growth will suffer. However, the consumption of energy beyond that optimal quantity will not necessarily result in an enhanced rate of economic growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a method for computing domestic and foreign contents that allows for processing trade. By applying our framework to Chinese data, we estimate that the share of domestic content in its manufactured exports was about 50% before China's WTO membership, and has risen to nearly 60% since then. There are also interesting variations across sectors. Those sectors that are likely labeled as relatively sophisticated such as electronic devices have particularly low domestic content (about 30% or less).

The introduced tests assume that the unspecified number of breaks is smaller than or equal to the maximum number of breaks set a priori. Monte Carlo simulations provide two main results. First, the proposed tests perform as well as the tests of Gregory and Hansen (1996a) and Hatemi-j (2008), which assume one or two breaks a priori, when the cointegration relationship has one or two breaks. Second, the proposed tests perform better than the tests of Gregory and Hansen (1996a) and Hatemi-j (2008) when the cointegration relationship has more than three breaks or persistent Markov switching shifts. We also provide empirical applications for the money demand of the U.S. The empirical results show that the proposed tests reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration as compared to other tests.

On the other hand, Robson [Robson, A.J., 1990. Efficiency in evolutionary games: Darwin, Nash and the secret handshake. J. Theoret. Biol. 144, 379-396] argues that genes can achieve efficient outcomes with a payoff-irrelevant type, even if such outcomes are not Nash. This paper follows Robson's approach but assumes that a more complex mutation in both the type and the behavior is an order of magnitude less likely than a simpler mutation in only the type or the behavior. In weakly acyclic games, every long-run stable strategy profile is a strict Nash equilibrium. Meanwhile, a Pareto undominated strict Nash equilibrium is stochastically stable if for each player, the opponents' equilibrium action profile uniquely maximizes his payoff given his equilibrium action. These results can be generalized to generic cyclic two-person games. In a common interests game, a strategy profile is selected if and only if it yields the unique Pareto efficient payoff vector.

Media owners have political motives as well as profit motives, and can influence public opinion by withholding information that is pejorative to their political agendaprovided that their agenda is not too far from the political mainstream. This is true even with rational consumers who understand the media owners biases, because the public do not know how much information the news organizations have and so do not know when news is being withheld. In line with conventional wisdom, this problem can be undone by competition; but competition can be defeated in equilibrium by media mergers that enhance profits at the expense of the public interest. We thus derive a motive for media merger policy that is completely distinct from the motives behind conventional antitrust. While media bias may reduce the profit incentives to merge, media markets nonetheless err by being insufficiently competitive, and the consequences of merger are more severe than in other markets.","[Anderson, Simon P.; McLaren, John] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Anderson, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",sa9w@virginia.edu; jem6x@virginia.edu,,"Anderson, simon/0000-0002-0161-8975; McLaren, John/0000-0003-1030-9880","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0752923] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,47,75,90,0,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

To formally study the effects of external financial conditions on FDI in the United States, we exploit the three dimensions of a panel of US inward FDI flows organized by recipient US industries, source countries and years for the recorded flows. Changes in the cost of finance in the source countries have little or no effect on total inward flows (the sum of equity, debt and reinvested earnings) over the 20062010 period. However, US industries characterized by more financial vulnerability experience statistically significant variations in the debt and equity components of inward FDI flows in response to the changes in the cost of capital that occurred in the source countries during the crisis.","[De Pace, Pierangelo] Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Contessi, Silvio] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"De Pace, P (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Econ, Carnegie Bldg,Room 205,425 N Coll Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",pierangelo.depace@pomona.edu,"De Pace, Pierangelo/AAC-8621-2019","Contessi, Silvio/0000-0002-7517-5417",,,,,20,6,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

But these differences obscure a common trend, namely a dramatic decline over time. France and Italy, for example, saved over 23% and 19% of national income in 1970, but only 9% and 4% respectively in 2008. Japan saved almost 33% in 1970, but only 7% in 2008. And the U.S. saved around 11% in 1970, but only 1% in 2008. What explains these international and intertemporal differences? Is it demographics, government spending, productivity growth or preferences? For the U.S. and France, whose saving behavior we study, preferences appear to be an important factor. American and French societies are placing increasing weight on the welfare of those currently alive, particularly contemporaneous older generations. Government spending also appears to be one of the reasons why France is saving at much lower rates. These conclusions emerge from estimating two models in which society makes consumption and labor supply decisions in light of uncertainty over future government spending, productivity, and social preferences. The two models differ in terms of the nature of preference uncertainty and the extent to which current society can control future societies' spending and labor supply decisions.

The results suggest that the portfolio of crops in a village economy becomes more diversified initially as the extent of the market increases. However, after the market size reaches a threshold, the production structure starts to specialize again.

We explore the process of causal thinking as a possible explanation for such deviations. Specifically, we suggest that causal information affects economic decisions based on the principles advocated by Weiner's (1985, 1986) attribution theory (AT) of motivation and emotion. Prior research in this area considered only subsets of the dimensions employed by the theory. We test the predictions stemming from AT in contexts where economic decisions involve sharing gains between party members (e.g., splitting profits) and assess how such decisions are affected by the reasons attributed for obtaining the gains. Results indicate a significant link between causal attribution and economic decisions and shed light on the rules and the rationale that guide this link.

We provide an empirical reconstruction of the US CDS network based on the FDIC Call Reports for off balance sheet bank data for the 4th quarter in 2007 and 2008. The propagation of financial contagion in networks with dense clustering which reflects high concentration or localization of exposures between few participants will be identified as one that is TITF. Those that dominate in terms of network centrality and connectivity are called 'super-spreaders'. Management of systemic risk from bank failure in uncorrelated random networks is different to those with clustering. As systemic risk of highly connected financial firms in the CDS (or any other) financial markets is not priced into their holding of capital and collateral, we design a super-spreader tax based on eigenvector centrality of the banks which can mitigate potential socialized losses.

The aim of the paper is to understand if players' expectations about competitors' moves are strong enough to induce at least one player to bid more than the auctioned euro. Any other bid represents an expected loss for the bidder, so he maximises his own payoff by choosing a bid, which produces a null expected payoff. The empirical results and the analysis based on them support theoretical findings. It is possible that the winner pays more than 1 to get 1 because of his expectations about competitors' bids and because of his indifference over a certain interval. The results are symptoms of some risk aversion. In an English auction escalation leads to this result, but when escalation is ruled out, expectations and indifference of preferences can lead to the same result. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The fear to lose the collateral creates future money demand by the debtor and thereby ensures positive money value. (2) Money is a safe asset as not only a single but all debtors in the economy demand money so that idiosyncratic shocks to solvency wash out. By this mechanism, fiat money is essentially equivalent to large securitized pools of debt which (3) can establish the pooling allocation even if pooling itself is infeasible. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using information regarding the location of theaters in the Tokyo metropolitan area, I examined the relationship between the number of attendees and the structure of the local market competition: a regression equation relating to the number of attendees and the local market structure was derived from a model of product differentiation, which incorporated the features of a movie theater market. The results revealed that nearby rival theaters had negative effects on other theaters' attendance numbers, and these effects did not dissipate even where there was 10 km between each theater. Based on empirical results, it appears that the Tokyo High Court and the competition agency defined the geographic movie theater market as being smaller than it actually was. The results of this study suggest that the application of econometric analysis, combining geographic information, is useful in merger reviews of retail industries, such as movie theaters.","Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sch Econ, Naka Ku, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan",Osaka Metropolitan University,"Sunada, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sch Econ, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan.",msunada@eco.osakafu-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730242] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,46,2,2,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The authors aim to shed some light on the relation between debt and main economic indicators. Their results clearly confirm that the amount of credit in the economy is a very important variable, which can affect economic performance in a twofold way: fostering growth or pushing the economy into recession or crisis. The outcomes of their computational experiments show a rich scenario of interactions between real and financial variables in the economy, and therefore represent a truly innovative tool for the study of economics.","[Raberto, Marco] Univ Genoa, DIME DOGE I, I-16145 Genoa, Italy; [Teglio, Andrea] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Genoa; Universitat Jaume I,"Raberto, M (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, DIME DOGE I, Via Opera Pia 15, I-16145 Genoa, Italy.",marco.raberto@unige.it,"Teglio, Andrea/AAI-9500-2021; Cincotti, Silvano/A-4680-2016","Raberto, Marco/0000-0002-0624-5709; Cincotti, Silvano/0000-0001-6778-0185",,,,,48,47,47,0,39,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 12,2012,6,,,,,,,,201227.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-27,0.0,,,49,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,973MI,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306363800001,0

Based on an extension of the results in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004) to third order, we derive propositions for how rare disasters, stochastic volatility, and GARCH affect any type of risk premia in a wide class of DSGE models. To quantify the effects, we set up a standard New Keynesian DSGE model where total factor productivity includes rare disasters, stochastic volatility, and GARCH. We find that rare disasters increase the level of the 10-year nominal term premium, whereas a key effect of uncertainty shocks, i.e. stochastic volatility and GARCH, is an increase in the variability of this premium.

We demonstrate that the ties induced by the extensive form do not change the result of Weinstein and Yildiz (2007). Specifically, like Weinstein and Yildiz (2007), we adopt the normal-form concept of interim correlated rationalizability and we assume that players have no relevant knowledge of the extensive-form payoff structure. The extensive-form result is weaker in the sense that while the result of Weinstein and Yildiz (2007) does not depend on the latter assumption, our result does. Our result implies that without restrictions on players' knowledge of payoffs, the dynamic structure of extensive-form games offers no force for robust refinements of rationalizability.

The model generates predictions about (1) participation in a green-electricity program at the extensive and intensive margins, and (2) changes in electricity consumption in response to participation. We test the theory using billing data for participants and nonparticipants in a green-electricity program in Memphis, Tennessee. High-consumption households are more likely to participate, and they participate at higher levels. In terms of a behavioral response, households participating above the minimum threshold level do not change electricity consumption, but those participating at the minimum threshold increase electricity consumption 2.5 percent after enrolling in the program. The result is based on identification strategies that exploit before-after differences between participants and nonparticipants, and differences in the timing of enrollment among participants only. Despite the increase in electricity demand upon the purchase of green electricity for the households with a buy-in mentality, the net effect for the buy-in households is a reduction in pollution emissions, as the behavioral response is not large enough to offset the environmental benefit of the green-electricity purchase.

It is shown that Smith assesses scientific activities as seeking to uncover underlying or hidden causal mechanisms at the real level that link together patterns and regularities at the empirical level of the world. He deals largely with such dimensions of science in his essays on natural sciences-particularly in his 'History of Astronomy'. Importantly, Smith applied a version of inference to the best explanation to evaluate possible competing hypotheses for the progress of scientific knowledge. This, and some related concepts help us to view Smith, who comes closer to a critical realist perspective as a modern version of scientific realism, in which a realist ontology is coupled to a form of epistemological dualism (a robust relativist epistemology).","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",glaskim@skku.edu,,"Kim, Kwangsu/0000-0002-9614-605X",,,,,63,15,18,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

These robust determinants are found to be unit root variables. Therefore, cointegration between these variables is tested with a recent time series panel method developed by Westerlund (2007). This method uses the error-correction formulation and has more power against the null of no cointegration. The results show that there is a well-defined long-run demand for money. Using the lagged error correction term from the estimated cointegrating equation, the short-run dynamic relationships are estimated. This paper, thus, suggests some useful guidelines to estimate other relationships with panel data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that these two facts are related. We use a labour market model with on-the-job search where by working longer hours individuals acquire greater skills. Since job candidates are ranked by productivity, greater skills not only increase worker's productivity in the current job but also help the worker to obtain better jobs. When job offers become more dispersed, wage inequality increases and workers work longer hours to obtain better jobs. As a result, average hours per worker in the economy increase. This mechanism accounts for around two-thirds of the increase in hours observed in data. Part of the increase is inefficient since workers obtain better jobs at the expense of other workers competing for the same jobs.",,,,,"Pijoan-Mas, Josep/G-1347-2016","Pijoan-Mas, Josep/0000-0003-1091-9232",,,,,55,11,11,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We introduce transparency as affecting unemployment forecasts that provide information that the central bank has to the private sector and the governments. Under conditions of monetary policy opaqueness and inflation bias, we show that monetary union may induce more reform (as governments mitigate inflation surprises under idiosyncratic shocks), albeit to a lesser extent when inflation bias is only present at the national level. In the absence of inflation bias, central bank transparency, by eliminating inflation surprises in the face of idiosyncratic shocks, induces less reform in a currency union relative to monetary autonomy. Altogether, these results point to the need for a strong political commitment to reform so that member states benefit most from the combination of a credible and transparent single monetary policy with measures aimed at improving competitiveness and enhancing long-term growth.","European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Sánchez, M (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",marcelo.sanchez@ecb.int,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We show that more inequality averse ERDU societies have higher social discount rates when future generations are better off.

One of them resulted in an ambitious unilateral effort to reduce most-favoured nation tariffs. The unilateral liberalization decision emerged as a measure to encourage growth, at a time of global economic crisis. This policy is based on the wide margin of action that the government of Mexico has in improving its foreign trade regulation. This paper reviews the logic of the implementation of tariff dismantling by a developing economy such as Mexico. It analyses the Mexican trade liberalization phases and explains the negative impact on the Mexican economy's competitiveness of high import tariffs with non-preferential trade partners. Finally, this paper presents preliminary estimates of the impact that the phase-out of Mexican tariffs had on imports during its first year of implementation.",,,,sgl@iqom.com.mx; jelopezcordova@gmail.com; jkz@iqom.com.mx,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We find that income inequality between groups rose moderately post-transformation, while overall inequality increased more sharply.

During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became relatively less productive in more-eroded areas. Agricultural adjustments recovered less than 25 percent of the initial difference in agricultural costs for more-eroded counties.

The literature is currently aiming to construct a consistent aggregate measure of poverty over time that takes into account individual income lifetime profiles. It is however, far from clear which aspects of the specific patterns of poverty spells should be included. Using longitudinal data for Spain, this paper shows that the effect of spell recurrence on poverty dynamics is relevant. Poverty exit and re-entry rates vary not only with personal or household characteristics but also with spell accumulation and the duration of current and past spells.

However, in the existing literature it appears that corruption seems to be less harmful in some countries than in others. The most striking examples are well known as the East Asian paradox: countries displaying exceptional growth records despite having thriving corruption cultures. The aim of this paper is to explain the high corruption but fast economic growth puzzle in China by providing firm-level evidence of the relation between corruption and growth and investigating how financial development influences the former relationship. Our empirical results show that corruption is likely to contribute to firms' growth. We further highlight the substitution relationship between corruption and financial development on firm growth. This means that corruption appears not to be a vital constraint on firm growth if financial markets are underdeveloped. However, pervasive corruption deters firm growth where there are more developed financial markets. This implies that fast firm growth will not be observed until a later stage of China's development when financial markets are well-functioning and corruption is under control. Furthermore, the substitution relationship exists in the private and state-owned firms. Geographically, similar results can be seen in the Southeast and Central regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We explore how the most economic of human behaviours, entrepreneurship, came to be largely excluded from mainstream economic theory. In contrast, we report that evolutionary economists have acknowledged the importance of understanding emergence and we explore the advances that have been made in this regard. We go on to argue that evolutionary economics can make further progress by taking a more 'naturalistic' approach to economic evolution. This requires that economic analysis be fully embedded in complex economic system theory and that associated understandings as to how humans react to states of uncertainty be explicitly dealt with. We argue that 'knowledge,' because of the existence of uncertainty is, to a large degree 'conjectural' and, thus, is closely linked to our emotional states. Our economic behaviour is also influenced by the reality that we, and the systems that we create, are dissipative structures. Thus, we introduce the notions of 'energy gradients' and 'knowledge gradients' as essential concepts in understanding economic emergence and resultant economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The key components of the model are an econometrically estimated linear drug violations equation relating drug violations to drug enforcement expenditures and other factors, a parameter measuring per capita costs of drug violations, and a Cobb-Douglas function relating social welfare to: (1) net consumption after drug costs and drug enforcement expenditures, and (2) benefits to users of illegal drugs. The parameters of the model are estimated from annual time series data for the United States from 1981 through 2007. It is determined that if the parameters of the social welfare function are such that the elasticity of social welfare with respect to net consumption (alpha) is near to unity and the elasticity of social welfare with respect to user benefits (beta) is near to zero, the estimated optimal expenditures on drug law enforcement are in the vicinity of the actual expenditures. However, comparative statics analysis of the optimum demonstrates two situations in which significantly reduced expenditures might be indicated: (1) if the alpha parameter in the social welfare function is significantly below unity and/or the beta parameter is significantly above zero; (2) if the drug cost parameter delta is in fact significantly less than estimates based on 1992-2002 data. The latter possibility might be the more relevant, because it seems more likely that society might be incorrectly estimating the costs of drug use (a positive issue) than that society is misperceiving its social welfare values (a normative issue).

J,"Ackerman, F; Stanton, EA",,,,"Ackerman, Frank; Stanton, Elizabeth A.",,,Climate Risks and Carbon Prices: Revising the Social Cost of Carbon,ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social cost of carbon; cost-benefit analysis; climate policy; climate economics,STABILIZATION; ECONOMICS; SCENARIOS; SYSTEM,"The social cost of carbon - or marginal damage caused by an additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions - has been estimated by a U.S. government working group at $21/tCO(2) in 2010. That calculation, however, omits many of the biggest risks associated with climate change, and downplays the impact of current emissions on future generations. Our reanalysis explores the effects of uncertainty about climate sensitivity, the shape of the damage function, and the discount rate. We show that the social cost of carbon is uncertain across a broad range, and could be much higher than $21/tCO(2). In our case combining high climate sensitivity, high damages, and a low discount rate, the social cost of carbon could be almost $900/tCO(2) in 2010, rising to $1,500/tCO(2) in 2050. The most ambitious scenarios for eliminating carbon dioxide emissions as rapidly as technologically feasible (reaching zero or negative net global emissions by the end of this century) require spending up to $150 to $500 per ton of reductions of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Using a reasonable set of alternative assumptions, therefore, the damages from a ton of carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 could exceed the cost of reducing emissions at the maximum technically feasible rate. Once this is the case, the exact value of the social cost of carbon loses importance: the clear policy prescription is to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible, and cost-effectiveness analysis offers better insights for climate policy than cost-benefit analysis.","[Ackerman, Frank; Stanton, Elizabeth A.] US Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA 02144 USA",,"Ackerman, F (通讯作者)，US Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA.",frank.ackerman@sei-us.org,,"Ackerman, Frank/0000-0002-7940-482X",,,,,28,139,152,4,51,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,APR 4,2012,6,,,,,,,,201210.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-10,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,928BS,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302955200001,0

The electorate votes strategically by taking into account the likely governments that parties would form based on their representation and the policies they would choose as a function of the status quo. The status quo thus affects both the election outcomes and the bargaining power of the parties during government formation. A formateur party therefore has incentives to strategically position the current policy to gain an advantage in both the next election and the subsequent bargaining over government formation and policy choice. These incentives can give rise to centrifugal forces that result in policies that are outside the Pareto set of the parties.","[Diermeier, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Dept Managerial Econ & Decis Sci MEDS, Kellogg Sch Management, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Diermeier, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Ford Motor Co, Ctr Global Citizenship, Kellogg Sch Management, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Baron, David P.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fong, Pohan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Northwestern University; Ford Motor Company; Northwestern University; Stanford University; City University of Hong Kong,"Diermeier, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Managerial Econ & Decis Sci MEDS, Kellogg Sch Management, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",d-diermeier@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,37,20,22,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We find that default risk is the main driver of yield spreads, suggesting small gains from greater liquidity. Fiscal fundamentals matter in the pricing of default risk but only as they interact with other countries yield spreads; that is, with the global risk that the market perceives. More importantly, the impact of this global risk variable is not constant over time, a clear sign of contagion driven by shifts in market sentiment. This evidence points to a discontinuity in the disciplinary role of financial markets. If markets can stay irrational longer than a country can stay solvent, then the role of yield spreads on national bonds as a fiscal discipline device is considerably weakened, and issuing Eurobonds can be economically justified.","[Favero, Carlo] Ruhr Univ Bochum, IGIER, Deutsch Bank Chair Asset Pricing & Quantitat Fina, Bochum, Germany; Ruhr Univ Bochum, CEPR, Bochum, Germany; Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy",Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum; University of Milan,"Favero, C (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, IGIER, Deutsch Bank Chair Asset Pricing & Quantitat Fina, Bochum, Germany.",,,"FAVERO, CARLO AMBROGIO/0000-0002-1668-9426",,,,,41,85,86,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

This paper answers that question using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium real business cycle model that includes a pollution externality. I first estimate the relationship between the cyclical components of carbon dioxide emissions and US GDP and find it to be inelastic. Using this result to calibrate the model. I find that optimal policy allows carbon emissions to be procyclical: increasing during expansions and decreasing during recessions. However, optimal policy dampens the procyclicality of emissions compared to the unregulated case. A price effect from costlier abatement during booms outweighs an income effect of greater demand for clean air. I also model a decentralized economy, where government chooses an emissions tax or quantity restriction and firms and consumers respond. The optimal emissions tax rate and the optimal emissions quota are both procyclical: during recessions, the tax rate and the emissions quota both decrease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Since 1948, the job finding probability has accounted for three-quarters of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate in the United States and the employment exit probability for one-quarter.

We explore the implications of non-separable household decisions caused by widespread non-participation in labor, land, financial and/or food markets, as is typical of low income economies. The analytical results indicate that when labor market imperfections occur, most tax-induced responses are ambiguous, mainly due to shadow price effects. This is particularly the case for the labor market and production responses to most tax tools under study, while a decreasing demand for consumption goods appears to be the result in several cases. Furthermore. tax-induced allocation effects may differ between the non-separable and the separable model versions, indicating the potential impact of labor market constraints on farm household responses to tax policies. In particular, standard taxes as well as a land tax may imply production adjustments in the case of non-separability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Even with a strong reduction in sales of sound recordings that coincided with the diffusion of digital copying technology, the annual number of new titles released to the market continued to expand. Results indicate that the number of new titles released has not deviated significantly from a long-term upward trend.

In this paper, we consider an alternative approach involving nonparametric method to model and forecast oil price return volatility. Focusing on two crude oil markets, Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI), we show that the out-of-sample volatility forecast of the nonparametric GARCH model yields superior performance relative to an extensive class of parametric GARCH models. These results are supported by the use of robust loss functions and the Hansen's (2005) superior predictive ability test. The improvement in forecasting accuracy of oil price return volatility based on the nonparametric GARCH model suggests that this method offers an attractive and viable alternative to the commonly used parametric GARCH models.

We argue that a nonstationary path that converges to a capital stock above the smallest golden rule may indeed be efficient. This finding has the important implication that capital overaccumulation need not always imply inefficiency. Under mild regularity and smoothness assumptions, we provide an almost-complete characterization of situations in which every path with limit in excess of the smallest golden rule must be inefficient, so that a version of the Phelps-Koopmans theorem can be recovered. Finally, we establish that a nonconvergent path with limiting capital stocks above (and bounded away from) the smallest golden rule can be efficient, even if the model admits a unique golden rule. Thus the Phelps Koopmans theorem in its general form fails to be valid, and we argue that this failure is robust across nonconvex models of growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We analyze the pattern of past growth based on a calculation of TFP growth, investigate the TFP dynamics by estimations of a TFP growth model, decompose the factors affecting TFP growth, and offer long-term projections of TFP growth. The main findings are as follows. First, results suggest that the growth accounting paradigm has shifted in the recent decade toward a productivity-based growth paradigm. Second, the catch-up effect is the major source of TFP growth in past decades, and the human capital contribution to TFP growth is gradually rising in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan in the most recent decade but is stagnated or weakened for other Asian economies. Third, the results project strong TFP growth for the two subperiods of 2010-2020 and 2020-2030 and thus suggest that the productivity-based growth will continue in the future long-term growth of the Asian economies.

To address the endogeneity of investment in electrification,! use the introduction of a new agricultural technology intensive in irrigation (the Green Revolution) as a natural experiment. As electric pumpsets are used to provide farmers with cheap irrigation water, I use the uneven availability of groundwater at the start of the Green Revolution to predict divergence in the expansion of the electricity network and, ultimately, to quantify the effect of electrification on industrial outcomes. I present a series of tests to show that the electrification channel remains the most important one among alternative explanations that could link groundwater availability to industrialization directly or indirectly. Results show that an increase in one standard deviation in the measure of electrification is associated with an increase of around 14% in manufacturing output for a state at the mean of the distribution.

The Law focuses on external imbalances as impediments to growth and does not consider the case where internal imbalances (budget deficits or public debt) can also constrain growth. The recent European public debt crisis shows that when internal imbalances are out of control they can constrain growth and domestic demand in a severe way. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by developing a growth model in line with Thirlwall's Law that takes into account both internal and external imbalances. The model is tested for Portugal which recently fell into a public debt crisis with serious negative consequences on growth. The empirical analysis shows that the growth rate in Portugal is in fact balance-of-payments constrained and the main drawback is the high import elasticity of the components of demand and in particular that of exports.

Unfortunately, this type of regulation can hamper economic growth by shifting banks' portfolios from more productive, risky investment projects toward less productive but safer projects. This paper introduces banking regulation in an overlapping-generations model and studies how it affects economic growth, banking sector stability, and welfare. In this model, a banking crisis is initiated by an aggregated shock ( in the risky sector) in a banking system with implicit bailout, and banking regulation is modeled as a constraint on the maximal share of banks' portfolios that can be allocated to risky assets. This model allows us to evaluate quantitatively the key trade-off, inherent in this type of regulation, between ensuring banking stability and fostering economic growth. The model implies an optimal level of regulation that prevents crises but at the same time is detrimental to growth. We find that the overall effect of optimal regulation on social welfare is positive when productivity shocks are sufficiently high (for example, in the subprime banking crisis episode) and economic agents are sufficiently risk-averse. Finally, we find that there is a trade-off between regulating the economy upfront (i.e. before the shock) and facing the challenge of making a huge bailout after the crisis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from a large number of industrialized countries and a group of Asian economies, we examine this link in three sub-periods: the first globalization period (18701913), the bloc economy period (19151959) and the second globalization period (19602004). The business cycle is identified as the series of deviates from a HodrickPrescott filtered trend. Cyclical turning points are located in the business cycles of our sample of 21 major countries, which enables us to comment on the characteristics of business cycles in the three periods. Cross-correlations of the cyclical deviates are calculated for all the pairs of the 21 countries examined. It is apparent from casual inspection that the business cycle characteristics and the pattern of cross-correlations in the bloc economy period are different from those found for the two globalization periods, whereas there is less difference between the two globalization periods. Following the estimations by Frankel and Rose, we relate business cycle synchronization to trade patterns and currency unions. Consequently, we find that European integration was already discernible in terms of business cycle synchronization in the early 1900s and that a similar synchronization was not discernible for Asia.","[Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Artis, Michael J.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Artis, Michael J.] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Keio University; University of Manchester; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Okubo, T (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, 3-15-45 Mita Minato Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",okubo@econ.keio.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22330087, 21243021, 22243023] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,39,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Our method combines a structural vector autoregression with a multilevel factor model, which helps us understand the economic meaning of the estimated factors. Using quarterly data of real GDP growth covering 9 emerging Asian economies and G-7 countries, we estimate a global supply factor, a global demand factor, and group supply and demand factors for each group of the economies. We find that although the role of the global factors has intensified over the past 15 years for most of the economies, output fluctuations in Asia have remained less synchronized with the global factor than those in the industrial countries. The Asian regional factors have become increasingly important in tightening the interdependence within the region over time. Therefore, although emerging Asian economies cannot decouple completely from the advanced economies, they have, nonetheless, sustained a strong independent cycle among themselves. We also find that synchronized supply shocks contributed more to the observed synchronization in output fluctuations among the Asian economies than demand shocks. This points to the role of productivity enhancement and transmission of other supply shocks through, for example, vertical trade integration, rather than dependence on external demand, as the primary source of business cycle synchronization in emerging Asia.","[He, Dong; Liao, Wei] Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"He, D (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dhe@hkma.gov.hk,,,,,,,35,33,34,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The model predicts that natural resources have an adverse impact on economic performance and transition to democracy in authoritarian regimes but not in democracies.

Information regarding the firm's efficiency (or its potential to pay taxes) is private; therefore, only the firm knows its 'type'. To prevent opportunism and lead the firm to disclose information through its period-1 output, the period-1 per-unit tax needs to be lower than it would if information were perfect (and tax revenue is consequently lower). As a result, expected taxes increase with time. This behaviour generally (but not always) reduces social welfare. In contrast, when the government prefers the firm's information is not disclosed by the period-1 signal, the expected per-unit tax in such period is the same as it would be if information were perfect. Moreover, if the firm reveals no information, then welfare is generally (but not always) greater than it would be if information were perfect. The government would generally prefer information not to be revealed, because disclose would greatly reduce its period-1 tax income. From a social standpoint, information non-disclosure increases welfare, except when both the probability of the firm being efficient and its efficiency level relative to that of the inefficient firm are sufficiently high.","[Antelo, Manel] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Antelo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Econ, Campus Norte, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",manel.antelo@usc.es,,"Antelo, Manel/0000-0003-1846-6872",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2012,,203,,,,,57,86,,,,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,206NJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323528300003,0

If private sector inflation expectations become sufficiently unanchored, the model predicts that a monetary authority can easily be trapped into validating these expectations, thereby pushing the economy to a lower welfare equilibrium. Given the ease with which expectation traps arise in the presence of international linkages, the main result presented here suggests that maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations is a critically important policy goal for central banks in open economies.","Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Arseneau, DM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",david.m.arseneau@frb.gov,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Specifically, we asked about attitudes toward renting versus buying a home; about commuting; and about how much to spend on a mortgage. By matching the results to data about relative house price declines during the recent crisis (at the ZIP-code level), we can study the relationship between the housing crash and individual attitudes. We find that younger respondents are relatively less confident about homeownership after larger declines, while older respondents are relatively more confident. In both cases, this is observed only for those with personal experience of loss (via themselves or someone close) during the crash. We find no effect on attitudes toward commuting, and we find that people who live in the high-decline areas believe it is appropriate to spend more on a mortgage.","[Bracha, Anat] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Res Dept, Boston, MA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Bracha, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Res Dept, Boston, MA USA.",anat.bracha@bos.frb.org; julian.jamison@bos.frb.org,,,,,,,26,2,2,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Nonetheless there are some implicit theoretical assumptions whose policy implications need to be assessed. This is the case for the 'excess capacity' assumption, which implies that resources are available as needed to adjust production to new equilibrium states. In an actual economy, however, new resources are often scarce and always costly. When supply constraints intervene, the assessment of the effects of government demand policies may be substantially different from that of the standard Leontief multiplier matrix. Using a closed general equilibrium model that incorporates supply constraints, we perform some simple numerical exercises and proceed to derive two 'constrained' multiplier matrices, based upon the implicit Jacobian matrix, that can be compared with the standard 'unconstrained' Leontief matrix.","[Cardenete Flores, Manuel Alejandro] Commiss European Communities, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain; [Cardenete Flores, Manuel Alejandro] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain; [Sancho, Ferran] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, Bellaterra, Catalonia, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Cardenete Flores, MA (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain.",Manuel-Alejandro.Cardenete@ec.europa.eu,"Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro/A-5300-2015; Sancho, Ferran/K-1714-2014","Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro/0000-0001-7495-7479; Sancho, Ferran/0000-0002-6200-116X",,,,,34,11,11,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

A forecast that is based only on an econometric model is replicable and may be unbiased, whereas a forecast that is not based only on an econometric model, but also incorporates expert intuition, is non-replicable and is typically biased. In this paper we propose a methodology to analyze the qualities of individual and alternative means of non-replicable forecasts. One part of the methodology seeks to retrieve a replicable component from the non-replicable forecasts, and compares this component against the actual data. A second part modifies the estimation routine due to the assumption that the difference between a replicable and a non-replicable forecast involves measurement error. An empirical example to forecast economic fundamentals for Taiwan shows the relevance of the methodological approach using both individuals and alternative mean forecasts.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Franses, Philip Hans; Mcaleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Mcaleer, Michael] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Mcaleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",National Chung Hsing University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Kyoto University; Complutense University of Madrid,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 250 Kuo Kuang Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",changchialin@nchu.edu.tw,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X; Franses, Philip Hans/0000-0002-2364-7777",,,,,7,1,1,0,5,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Besides, this study finds out that there is 'the advantage of firm size' for patent performance, and demonstrates that R&D expenditures and employee productivity have positive effects on patent performance in this industry. Furthermore, this study applies cluster analysis to divide the sample into three groups named 'Giant Enterprises', 'Indistinct Enterprises' and 'Ameba Enterprises'.

Using cointegration techniques and accounting for the 2006 structural break in the carbon market, we show that while a cointegrating relationship exists for both phases of the EU ETS, the nature of this equilibrium relationship is different across the two subperiods, with an increasing role of fundamentals in Phase II.

Today, the discrepancy between the legal rights of women and men is much larger in developing compared with developed countries. Historically, even in countries that are now rich, women had few rights before economic development took off. Is development the cause of expanding women's rights, or conversely, do women's rights facilitate development? We argue that there is truth to both hypotheses. The literature on the economic consequences of women's rights documents that more rights for women lead to more spending on health and children, which should benefit development. The political-economy literature on the evolution of women's rights finds that technological change increased the costs of patriarchy for men and thus contributed to the expansion of women's rights. Combining these perspectives, we discuss the theory of Doepke & Tertilt (2009), who find that an increase in the return to human capital induces men to vote for women's rights, which in turn promotes growth in human capital and income per capita.","[Doepke, Matthias] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Tertilt, Michele] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Voena, Alessandra] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; University of Mannheim; Harvard University,"Doepke, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",doepke@northwestern.edu; tertilt@uni-mannheim.de; ale.voena@gmail.com,,"Tertilt, Michele/0000-0003-0605-4141; Doepke, Matthias/0000-0001-8073-6138",,,,,103,86,99,7,86,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4604-1,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Federal benefits were about 48 percent higher, on average, than the benefits received by similar private-sector workers, which led to roughly a 16 percent difference in total compensation (the sum of benefits and wages). Much of the higher cost of federal benefits stems from differences in retirement benefits. The government provides employees defined-benefits pensions and subsidized health insurance in retirement; arrangements that have become uncommon in the private sector. The distribution of compensation also differed between the sectors, such that less-educated federal workers tended to earn much more than their private-sector counterparts, whereas highly-educated workers tended to receive higher compensation in the private sector.",,,,justin.falk@cbo.gov,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

To explore interaction effects, the so-called interaction terms x(1)x(2) are typically included in estimation specifications. While in linear models the effect of a marginal change in the interaction term is equal to the interaction effect, this equality generally does not hold in nonlinear specifications (Ai and Norton, 2003). This article provides for a general derivation of marginal and interaction effects in both linear and nonlinear models and calculates the formulae of the marginal and interaction effects resulting from the Two-Part Model (2PM), a commonly employed censored regression model. Drawing on a survey of automobile use from Germany, we illustrate several subtleties inherent to the substantive interpretation of interaction effects gleaned from nonlinear models, such as the 2PM.","[Frondel, Manuel] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany; [Frondel, Manuel; Vance, Colin James] Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Vance, Colin James] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Jacobs University,"Frondel, M (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Str 150, Bochum, Germany.",frondel@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,7,11,12,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We argue that, by opening the US and Canadian markets to Mexican goods, NAFTA made it easier for domestic producers to take advantage of the opportunities brought by the depreciation of the real exchange rate. To identify this mechanism, we use plant-level data and compare the behavior of employment, production and investment after two big real exchange rate shocks: the first observed in the mid-1980s, the second the Tequila Crisis of 1994-1995. The evidence indicates that after passage of NAFTA exporting firms exhibited higher growth rates of employment, sales and investment vis-a-vis non-exporters. We confirm our results by analyzing the behavior of a control group of firms, that had complete access to the US market during both devaluations, and we show that they responded in a similar way in both events. Finally, we also provide direct evidence on the relationship between exports and tariff reductions brought by NAFTA. Our results support the view that NAFTA has allowed Mexican producers to respond more quickly to real exchange shocks.","[Fuentes, Miguel] Cent Bank Chile, Res Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Ibarraran, Pablo] Interamer Dev Bank, Off Strateg Planning & Dev Effectiveness, Washington, DC USA",Central Bank of Chile; Inter-American Development Bank,"Fuentes, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Chile, Res Dept, Santiago, Chile.",fuentes.miguel@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,1,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We also find that when institutional investors are classified as pressure resistant and pressure sensitive according to the strength of their ties with managers, pressure-resistant investors, who operate more independently, are the most capable of improving the value of the firm.","[Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J.] Univ Valladolid, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Jara-Bertin, Mauricio] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Dept Auditing & Informat Syst, Concepcion, Chile; [Lopez-de-Foronda, Oscar] Univ Burgos, Dept Corp Finance, Burgos 09001, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; Universidad de Burgos,"López-Iturriaga, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Avda Valle Esgueva 6, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",flopez@eco.uva.es,"Jara, Mauricio/HHN-5573-2022; Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J./F-5321-2012","Lopez-Iturriaga, Felix J./0000-0003-0875-5283; Jara, Mauricio/0000-0001-6339-3794; , OSCAR/0000-0002-4585-7847",,,,,53,22,22,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The recent oil price hike raises concerns regarding the possible negative effects of the rising oil price on the economy as in the 1970s. We investigate the effects of the oil price hike on the Korean economy using a Bayesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DGSE) model. We explicitly model the small open economy nature of the Korean economy and its oil usage and estimate the constructed model within a unified Bayesian framework. We also examine possible changes in the effects of world oil shocks on the Korean economy using counterfactual simulations. We find the adverse effects of world oil shocks as well as their importance in Korean business cycles have diminished due to reductions in the relative usage of crude oil in the economy, while world oil shocks themselves have changed relatively little over time.","[Lee, Junhee] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, Kyongsan 712749, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Song, Joonhyuk] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Yeungnam University; Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Int Econ & Business, 214-1 Dae Dong, Kyongsan 712749, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.",lee1838@ynu.ac.kr,"Lee, Junhee/A-2247-2019","Lee, Junhee/0000-0003-3634-051X",,,,,9,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

This study extends previous research along two important dimensions. First, we allow for the potential endogeneity between economic growth and telecommunications expansion by employing a special linear Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. Second, we explicitly model for varying degrees of substitutability between mobile cellular and land line telephony, so that greater expansion of mobile telecommunications can have a different impact whenever the level of land line penetration differs. We find that mobile cellular phone expansion is an important determinant of the rate of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, we find that the contribution of mobile cellular phones to economic growth has been growing in importance in the region, and that the marginal impact of mobile telecommunication services is even greater wherever land line phones are rare. Given the low cost of mobile telecommunications technology relative to other broad infrastructure projects, especially land line infrastructure, we advocate that mobile telecommunication services be encouraged in the area.","[Lee, Sang H.] SE Louisiana Univ, Dept Business Adm & Finance, Hammond, LA 70402 USA; [Levendis, John] Loyola Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Gutierrez, Luis] Univ Rosario, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia",University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University; Loyola University New Orleans; Universidad del Rosario,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，SE Louisiana Univ, Dept Business Adm & Finance, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",slee@selu.edu,"Lee, Sang/I-6370-2019; Gutierrez, Luis H./E-1844-2016","Lee, Sang/0000-0003-3612-8666; Gutierrez, Luis H./0000-0002-7540-2069",,,,,29,88,95,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our specific research questions are as follows: (i) has there been a reversal in employment and unemployment dynamics at a regional level during the crisis (2007-10) compared with the previous period (2004-07)? (ii) have the western regions ('old' EU states) behaved differently in response to the crisis compared with the eastern regions (NMS)? Finally, (iii) are the differences between the two groups of regions related to structural or institutional variables? After a review of the literature on the key determinants of regional unemployment, we summarise our main findings concerning the impact of the global crisis on the labour market. Our econometric investigation aims to answer the questions we pose. Structural characteristics are considered in terms of sector specialisation of regional economies. In addition, we consider certain institutional characteristics, by including indicators of the share of temporary workers and of long-term unemployed. Our analysis is then targeted at sub-samples of western and eastern European regions: we show that the critical factors for labour market performance during the crisis in these two groups differ greatly. From a methodological viewpoint, we exploit a spatial filtering technique which allowed us to greatly reduce any unobserved variable bias - a significant problem in cross-sectional models - by accounting for latent unobserved spatial patterns.","[Marelli, Enrico] Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy; [Patuelli, Roberto] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Patuelli, Roberto] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Signorelli, Marcello] Univ Perugia, I-06100 Perugia, Italy",University of Brescia; University of Bologna; University of Perugia,"Marelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy.",emarelli@eco.unibs.it-,"Patuelli, Roberto/C-6271-2008","Patuelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1908-4307; MARELLI, Enrico/0000-0001-9690-188X; SIGNORELLI, Marcello/0000-0002-7820-7090",,,,,54,56,59,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24,2,,,,,155,175,,10.1080/14631377.2012.675153,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,944CD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304175100001,0

Do stock prices initially overreact to such information? We modelled market-adjusted daily changes in stock prices of the 17 biggest pharmaceutical firms worldwide for the period from 1989 to 2008 to detect large price changes (outliers), using an Autoregressive Moving Average-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) dynamic econometric model. Then, we matched those outliers with news produced during the drug R&D process, and tested the hypothesis of no overreaction by examining cumulative abnormal returns. Our results show that there were 261 abnormal market-adjusted daily returns. In 60% of the cases, we were able to assign a plausible cause; i.e. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals in 6% of these cases, news of a scientific nature in another 25%. Only 10 of 1721 FDA approvals of new drugs during the study period were related to abnormally large returns. The impact of negative news items on stock prices is larger than of positive news items. The overreaction hypothesis is rejected; there is no price backlash, therefore, the efficient market hypothesis is not violated.","[Perez-Rodriguez, Jorge V.; Valcarcel, Beatriz G.

Many scholars have proposed that consumers will follow a two-stage decision process. This paper argues that in spatial choice contexts the role of the consideration set may largely depend on the decision maker's level of access to the alternatives. It is proposed that in conditions where the decision maker's accessibility toward alternatives is constrained for example as a result of time space feasibility a two-stage model will perform better than a on-stage model. The more restrictive the constraints, the more important the role of the consideration set. The paper presents a simulation analysis of the effects of geographical accessibility on consideration and choice in the context of motorists' decisions where to refuel. It simulates a grid road network where the motorists' access to petrol stations is constrained by the geographical location of the alternatives, the availability of network connections between them and the decision makers' time budgets. In this hypothetical spatial environment the study simulates consideration and choice processes for refuelling options under different conditions of petrol station access, (non-spatial) station attractiveness, and heterogeneity in the decision maker's time budget.","[Pramono, Ari] Dept Mkt, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",,,Ari.Pramono@monash.edu; Harmen.Oppewal@monash.edu.au,"Oppewal, Harmen/C-1457-2013; Pramono, Ari/AAJ-5168-2020","Oppewal, Harmen/0000-0002-5221-2043; Pramono, Ari/0000-0002-8770-3491",,,,,35,6,8,0,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The expansion of the network is carried out through auctions of financial transmission rights for congested links. The mechanism is tested for a simplified transmission grid with ten interconnected zones, ten nodes, eleven lines and seventy eight generators in the Ontario province.

These are simple adaptive behavior rules that lead to no regrets and, if followed by all players, exhibit nice convergence properties: the average play converges to correlated equilibrium, or even to Nash equilibrium in certain classes of games. However, the no-regret property relies on a strong assumption that each player treats her opponents as unresponsive and fully ignores the opponents' possible reactions to her actions. We show that if at least one player is slightly responsive, it is impossible to achieve no regrets, and convergence results for regret minimization with responsive opponents are unknown.

The reason why a credit institution decides to involve itself in social activities is a question which the literature on economics has tried to answer. We highlight the relationship created between the credit institution as a social organization and its various stakeholders, analyzing the importance assigned to each of them. Our goal is to find distinct profiles of credit institutions, depending on their degree of concern about CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). The field work was conducted by means of a survey answered by 57 Spanish credit institutions. The results show the interest of such institutions in CSR in relation to the entire Spanish financial sector. Three clusters are distinguished according to how they think about CSR. In the first cluster there are institutions with responsibility focused on employees. It includes entities whose priority stakeholders are shareholders and employees. In the second cluster, we find institutions with responsibility focused on society. Among the stakeholders they act primarily towards customers, society and the environment. The third cluster is made up of institutions with responsibility focused on legislation (norms). In the third cluster, there is Friedman's vision, which considers the social responsibility of the bank as the maximization of Profit.","Univ Valencia, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Segui-Alcaraz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Avda Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",antonisegui@coev.es,"Alcaraz, Antoni Segui/AIE-0098-2022",,,,,,52,3,3,0,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We compare the predictive performance within and among various classes of structural and empirical models in a consistent framework using Bayesian and other estimation techniques. We find that money contains relevant information for inflation in some model classes. Money-based New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models and Vector Autoregressions (VARs) incorporating money perform better than their cashless counterparts. But there are also indications that the contribution of money has its limits. The marginal contribution of money to forecasting accuracy is often small, money adds little to dynamic factor models, and it worsens forecasting accuracy of partial equilibrium models. Finally, nonmonetary models dominate monetary models in an all-out horserace.","[Stavrev, Emil] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Berger, Helge] IMF, Washington, DC USA",Free University of Berlin; International Monetary Fund,"Stavrev, E (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Dept Econ, Boltzmann Str 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",estavrev@imf.org,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Specifically, two sample periods and five in-sample forecast horizons in two measures of inflation, which are the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are used in the exclusions-from-core inflation persistence model. This article finds that core inflation is only able to capture the overall trend of total inflation for the 12-quarter in-sample forecast horizon using the CPI in both the parametric and nonparametric models in the longer sample period. The nonparametric model outperforms the parametric model for both data samples and for all five in-sample forecast horizons.","Coll Charleston, Dept Econ & Finance, Sch Business & Econ, Charleston, SC 29401 USA",College of Charleston,"Tierney, HLR (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Dept Econ & Finance, Sch Business & Econ, 5 Liberty St,Suite 415, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",hlrtierney@yahoo.com,,"Tierney, Heather LR/0000-0002-4855-2010",,,,,42,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It individuates the most robust correlates of the persistence of localized conflict, both across specifications and using different econometric models of duration analysis. Results suggest that violence in Colombia is more persistent in places where illegal rents are available.

The findings indicate that big banks in China can even earn the highest profits in the world mostly because of market efficiency. Their operational efficiency is lower than in smaller banks. They have high market efficiency simply because they are monopolies in Chinese banking sector.

We also show that we can replace order-preservation with egalitarian-equivalence or no-envy (on the subadditive domain) and still characterize the welfare-egalitarian class. However, if we weaken order preservation to symmetry, mechanisms that are not welfare-egalitarian exist.

The inspector may engage in three forms of corruption - bribery, extortion and framing - with two types of costs: the cost of distorting information against the firm and the cost of side-transfer. In contrast with the earlier literature on corruption, we show that not only bribery but also extortion and framing may occur in equilibrium, even when all the forms of corruption could be deterred. We also find that higher costs of engaging in corruption may result in lower social welfare. Although these costs make engaging in corruption more difficult and hence more easily deter corruption, when corruption occurs in equilibrium, the costs cause wastage of scarce resources from society's point of view. This analysis also provides an explanation of why corruption is more pervasive in less developed countries.","Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Yun, SH (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",uwyunsh@gmail.com,"yun, sungho/Q-9971-2019","Yun, Sungho/0000-0001-6380-9534",,,,,19,2,2,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Even though the first economic analyses of economic structures in supply chains emerged already in the 1950s (most notably Spengler, 1950), and many other studies followed in the next three decades, most of the economic literature before the 1990s fails to fit the analyses in a game-theoretical framework, which renders the comparison of the individual models rather difficult. A game-theoretical comparison of some of the existing models has recently been carried out independently by Lau and Lau (2005) and Kogan and Tapiero (2007). Our paper tries to compare the models reviewed in both of these sources, together with some alternatives that either have been neglected in both of these studies or have appeared in literature since.

We find a short-run output elasticity of public capital supplied at the central government level of 0.083, which increases to 0.122 in the long run. If, in addition, only core infrastructure at a regional/local level of government is considered, these estimates are almost doubled. The average output elasticity of public capital amounts to 0.106. Our results suggest that public capital is undersupplied in OECD economies.","[Bom, Pedro R.

We propose a stylized dynamic model that integrates these two dimensions. A distinguishing feature of our model is that the duration of the game is determined endogenously by the users' collective decisions. In the proposed model, if the resource stock level below which the irreversible event occurs is known in advance, then the optimal resource use coincides with a unique symmetric equilibrium that guarantees survival of the resource. As the uncertainty about the threshold level increases, resource use increases if users adopt decision strategies that quickly deplete the resource stock, but decreases if they adopt path strategies guaranteeing that the unknown threshold level is never exceeded. We show that under relatively high uncertainty about resource size, CPR users frequently implement decision strategies that terminate the game immediately. When this uncertainty is reduced, they maintain a positive resource level for longer durations.","[Botelho, Anabela; Pinto, Ligia M.

When private and public consumption expenditures are complements in the household utility and the tax schedule is progressive, we analytically show that the economy exhibits indeterminacy and sunspots if and only if the degree of government-spending preference externality is higher than a critical threshold. Unlike traditional Keynesian-type stabilization policies, raising the tax progressivity may destabilize this version of our model by generating endogenous cyclical fluctuations. Moreover, the economy always displays saddle-path stability and equilibrium uniqueness under utility substitutability between private and public consumptions and progressive taxation.

The results indicate that both stronger competition and the presence of the public good have positive main effects on bids. More importantly, we find a negative interaction between stronger competition and the presence of the public good, leading us to reject separability.

The absence of a monetary policy rule created go-stop incentives that produced inefficient volatility of both inflation and unemployment during the Great Inflation. Fed credit policy has undergone massive mission creep since the Fed was established. Being debt-financed fiscal policy, Fed credit policy beyond ordinary temporary lending to solvent depositories creates friction with the fiscal authorities and jeopardizes the Fed's independence. An ambiguous boundary of expansive Fed credit policy creates expectations of Fed accommodation in financial crisis that blunts the incentive of private entities to take protective measures beforehand (to shrink counter-party risk and reliance on short-term finance, and build up equity capital) and blunts the incentive of the fiscal authorities to prepare procedures in advance to act systematically in times of credit turmoil. These points are illustrated with reference to the 2007-09 financial crisis. Part of the problem is that the independent Fed does not have the same incentive as the 19th century Bank of England to follow Bagehot's Rule. The paper concludes with a set of principles to preserve a workable, sustainable division of responsibilities between the independent central bank and the fiscal authorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, local government as a sphere in the country is notorious for its spending inefficiency, which is cited as a major factor in service delivery failure. This paper quantifies inefficient expenditure at the local government level by estimating efficiency scores for a sample of 129 municipalities in South Africa from the 2005/2006 to the 2009/2010 municipal financial years. In essence, this paper examines the technical efficiency of municipalities by using the nonparametric free disposable hull approach and finds that 10 municipalities are constantly efficient over the period. On average, input efficiency scores range from 42% to 46%, suggesting that, in general, municipalities can achieve the same output levels with over 50% less resources. Quantitatively for the 2009/2010 financial year, this amounts to a total of R80 billion being spent inefficiently, which equates to R220 million being wasted per day.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Mahabir, J (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Auckland Pk Kingsway Campus, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",jugal.mahabir@me.com,,,,,,,41,7,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Financing budget deficits is the very opposite of the principle adopted when Congress approved the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.

This paper investigates the effect of religious beliefs on economic growth using provincial panel data from 2001 to 2011 in China. It's very meaningful to study the role of religion playing in economic development since religion has influence on political preference, human capital and work ethic, especially in current China which is faced with income disparity, environmental pollution, and official corruption. Our results reveal that, among the different religions, Christianity has the most significant effect on economic growth. This conclusion is consistent among different estimators and robust with stability overtime. However, no consistent or robust conclusions can be drawn for other religions. Different estimation methods give different signs or significance. Given the very few studies and limited data resources about China in this field, the paper as a tentative study provides a brand new viewpoint. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The incorporation of water resources modeling into integrated assessment models (IAMs) to study climate-hydrology processes, related water impacts and adaptation options is thus an area of interest, yet it poses a number of methodological challenges. In particular, models of economic activity, climate, water availability and use, and adaptation are developed at differing temporal and spatial scales and with different goals. This makes their integration highly complex and computationally demanding. In this review we highlight a set of modeling challenges in water resource systems, describe the state of the art of approaches to integrating water resources modeling with IAMs and economic modeling, and identify constraints and opportunities moving forward in the development of water resources modeling within the JAM frameworks.

Through the establishment of an integrated forecast model for China's aviation fuel demand, this paper confirms that the significant rise in China's aviation fuel demand because of increasing air services demand is more than offset by higher aviation fuel efficiency. There are few studies which use a predictive method to decompose, estimate and analyze future aviation fuel demand. Based on a structural decomposition with indirect prediction, aviation fuel demand is decomposed into efficiency and total amount (aviation fuel efficiency and air transport total turnover). The core influencing factors for these two indexes are selected using path analysis. Then, univariate and multivariate models (ETS/ARIMA model and Bayesian multivariate regression) are used to analyze and predict both aviation fuel efficiency and air transport total turnover. At last, by integrating results, future aviation fuel demand is forecast. The results show that the aviation fuel efficiency goes up by 0.8% as the passenger load factor increases 1%; the air transport total turnover goes up by 3.8% and 0.4% as the urbanization rate and the per capita GDP increase 1%, respectively. By the end of 2015, China's aviation fuel demand will have increased to 28 million tonnes, and is expected to be 50 million tonnes by 2020. With this in mind, increases in the main aviation enterprises' business profits must be achieved through the further promotion of air transport. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that a technological leader has an incentive to locate in isolation only if her advantage exceeds a certain threshold, which is increasing in firms' discount rate, in industry dispersion, and in the intensity of knowledge spillovers.

They concluded that, rather like (apocryphal) ostriches sticking their heads in the sand, investors avoid unpleasant information by reducing portfolio monitoring in response to news of negative market movement. We apply generalised non-linear mixed effects models to test for this selective information monitoring at an individual level in a new sample of active online investors. We see different behaviour in this new sample. We find that investors increase their portfolio monitoring following both positive and daily negative market returns, behaving more like hyper-vigilant meerkats than head-in-the-sand ostriches. This pattern persists for logins not resulting in trades and weekend logins when markets are closed. Moreover, an investor personality trait - neuroticism - moderates the pattern of portfolio monitoring suggesting that market - driven variation in portfolio monitoring is attributable to psychological factors.

This study tries to explore the relationship among the relationship trust, relationship learning and sports learning effect, which chose Taiwan's college class A team as subject to do empirical study. We adopted purposive sampling and delivered the questionnaire in a total of 1,000 copies. The duration was from October 1st to 10th of 2009. The valid samples amounted to 459, valid rate up to 45.9%. We used structural equation model (SEM) to test the model fitness and the hypotheses. The results show: (1) specific assets, internal complexity, environmental uncertainty, communication and commitment can positively affect the relationship learning; (2) the hypothesis presuming specific assets, communication and perceived satisfaction, commitment and dependency can positively affect the relationship trust is supported. In addition, the hypothesis presuming behavioral uncertainty negatively affects the relationship trust is not supported. The both-sides negotiation based on common benefit is the main reason for behavior and record adjustment of coaches and players in a college class team. Thus, the possibility of distrust can be declined and the relationship between the behavioral uncertainty and relationship trust proves nonsignificant; (3) the hypotheses presuming the relationship learning and relationship trust can positively affect the learning effect and the relationship trust can positively affect relationship learning are both supported; (4) the hypothesis presuming the higher degree of trust will decline positive effect of the relationship learning and learning effect is not supported. The reason is that the coach and players have the common benefit and the team also establishes a good and completed motivation system; thus, it can reduce the potential problem whereby the traditional business partners generally filter the negative or critical information, even the opportunistic behavior. According to these results, we further provide recommendations and hope these could be a reference for the coach in real training; moreover, can they improve the effect of the whole training and achieve the goal.","[Lin, Pai-Yeh; Chang, Chia-Liu] Chung Chou Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Exercise & Hlth Promot, Caracas 510, Changhua County, Venezuela; [Hsieh, Ching-Lung] Chung Chou Univ Sci & Technol, Off Continuing Educ, Caracas 510, Changhua County, Venezuela; [Hung, Chih-Hsiang] Taipei Med Univ, Off Phys Educ Affairs, Coll Humanities & Social Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",Taipei Medical University,"Chang, CL (通讯作者)，Chung Chou Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Exercise & Hlth Promot, Caracas 510, Changhua County, Venezuela.",pearll@dragon.ccut.edu.tw; clshay@dragon.ccut.edu.tw; ylps36@dragon.ccut.edu.tw; sean0326@tmu.edu.tw,,,,,,,52,2,2,2,17,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

In this paper, we ask: are such restrictions a useful policy tool to facilitate growth? We provide a theory of borrowing constraints on households as a tool to correct a learning-by-doing externality. Borrowing constraints operate as a policy tool through two channels: (i) increasing labor supply and (ii) reallocating labor towards traded goods. We find that welfare gains are closest to that of the First-Best Planner allocation when the externality is not too large. We compute the sequence of optimal constraints along the growth path and show how the use of this policy tool contributes to repressed wages, current account balance, and slow real exchange rate appreciation.

We aim to empirically disentangle these channels by tracking evolution of corporate transparency for 4061 listed firms in tradable sectors in 49 countries during 1992-2005. By using detailed tariff schedules, we measure changes in growth opportunities and product market competition enabled by foreign and domestic trade liberalizations, respectively. On the one hand, higher growth opportunities engendered by foreign trade reforms are disproportionately associated with better corporate transparency in industries that depend more heavily on external financing. On the other hand, greater product market competition engendered by domestic tariff reductions has no significant impact on corporate transparency. (C) 2014 International Monetary Fund.

The first step is a retrospection of the literature and evidence accumulated in the field. As a typical transition economy with rapid and extensive devolution reforms, China is the ideal context to examine the causes, processes, and effects of fiscal decentralization, which will attract numerous academic endeavors, both domestic and abroad. However, the literature has not been fully reviewed and the evidence on fiscal decentralization remains mixed and inconclusive. This paper is a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in the area of fiscal decentralization in China over the past decades. The processes, characteristics, and measurements of fiscal decentralization are firstly reviewed and the antecedents and consequences of fiscal decentralization are then synthesized. The knowledge gap and avenues for future research are finally discussed with the ultimate goal of making knowledge about fiscal decentralization in China contributive, accumulative, and sustainable.","[Wang, Zhiguo] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Ma, Liang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Ctr Publ Adm, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Ma, Liang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Ctr Performance Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Nanyang Technological University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Wang, Z (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",wangzhiguo66@gmail.com; liangma@ntu.edu.sg,"Ma, Liang/D-1834-2010","Wang, Zhiguo/0000-0001-9105-380X",,,,,65,8,8,1,51,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Of particular interest has been the distributional impact of globalization and whether this has been equity enhancing. Contributing to this debate, Chotikapanich etal. have previously estimated global and regional inequalities for 1993 and 2000. The current paper presents estimates of global inequality for 2005, making use of purchasing power parity (PPP) data from the 2005 International Comparison Program (ICP) round. A critical element in the estimation of regional and global inequality is the data on PPPs and real incomes. Another objective of the paper is to examine the sensitivity of the inequality results to the use of alternative sets of real incomes using different sets of PPP data to convert per capita income data into a common currency unit. The paper also compares levels and trends of global inequality measures based on real per capita income measures from the national accounts and those obtained using per capita expenditure data from household expenditure surveys. The main finding of the paper is that the populist view that globalization has increased inequality does not hold when inequality is measured at the global level. Between 1993 and 2005, inequality has consistently declined as measured both by the Gini coefficient and the Theil index. This decline in global inequality was the result of a decline in inequality between countries. The estimates do suggest that there is an overall upward trend in inequality within countries, lending some support for protestors against globalization. Another finding is that the levels of global inequality are indeed sensitive to the choice of PPPs. However, the downward trend in global inequality is consistently evident across different choices of PPPs and real incomes. We find similar trends in inequality and in the within and between components of inequality when inequality measures are based on national accounts real per capita incomes or on the survey-based real per capita expenditures.","[Warner, David; Rao, D.

While previous literature considers impacts of one parent absent on educational inputs (e.g., study time, enrollment, schooling attainment), this study directly investigates impacts on children's learning (test scores) and distinguishes impacts of absence of one versus both parents. Dynamic panel methods that control for both unobserved individual heterogeneity and endogeneity in parental absence are used with data collected from rural China. The estimates indicate significant negative impacts of being left-behind by both parents on children's cognitive development, reducing their contemporary achievements by 5.4 percentile points for math and 5.1 percentile points for Chinese, but much smaller insignificant impacts of being left-behind by one parent. Cross-sectional evidence indicates that only absence of both parents is associated with substantially lower family inputs in after-school tutoring. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The proposed model includes the following two setups: (1) a sector's own knowledge is adopted as a production factor, and (2) others' knowledge is regarded as a source of spillover effect to increase the total factor productivity (TFP) coefficient. This R&D-based CGE model is evaluated on whether its correspondence with reality is better than the standard model that omits the two setups. The two models compute baseline scenarios of South Korean economic growth from 1995 to 2010, and these results are compared to actual data. The results show that the R&D-based model fits better than the standard model in cases where the country has high TFP growth. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This unique tax treatment is widely excoriated as resulting in high costs and distorting consumption decisions. To study this issue, we develop a general equilibrium search model with endogenous health accumulation and a unique feature of the U.S. tax code, which exempts employer-provided medical benefits from taxation, to jointly account for the U.S. long-term unemployment rate and medical expenditure-to-aggregate consumption ratio. Through various counterfactual experiments, we find that (1) eliminating the employment-based tax subsidy lowers medical expenditure but, via a general equilibrium labor market effect, increases unemployment and lowers output, and contrary to conventional wisdom, lowers welfare; (2) having government raise taxes to finance the provision of medical care substantially increases the unemployment rate, while reducing income and welfare.","[Huang, Kevin X.

This increasing effect of borders and distance is associated with strengthened knowledge agglomeration over time. Nevertheless, both border and distance effects decrease with the age of patents. Aggregate border effects are often overestimated due to various aggregation bias.

J,"Santos, RM",,,,"Santos, Ricardo Manuel",,,Dynamic effects of labor supply: A mechanism explaining cross-sectional differences in hours,REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Macroeconomics; Labor supply decisions; Heterogeneous agents,WAGE INEQUALITY; TRENDS; US,"This paper first establishes the empirical fact that over the last quarter of the 20th century, the average weekly hours worked increased for workers in the highest wage quintile while it decreased for the ones at the lowest. In 1976, a worker in the lowest quintile worked 2.8 hours more per week than a high wage worker (worker in the highest quintile), but by 2006, the low wage worker worked 1 hour less. During this period, there was also a wide increase in wage inequality. The typical mechanism in which hours are only determined by contemporaneous wages cannot simultaneously explain the pattern found in both variables for every quintile. This paper attempts to reconcile these cross-sectional trends in both hours and wages for the US during this time period. As a first step, we show that compositional changes (in education, occupation and age) within quintiles can only explain a fraction of the observed pattern. Next, we propose a mechanism in which individuals' current decisions of how much to work take into account two components: the contemporaneous benefit of the wage received, and also how current hours worked affects the probability of moving across the wage distribution in later periods. The latter dynamic component is estimated from our dataset. We find that changes over time in how hours affect these probabilities provided incentives that differ across the quintiles, and are consistent with the labor supply decisions observed in the data. We incorporate these two components into an equilibrium model of heterogeneous agents with uninsurable income risk. We are able to replicate the decline in hours for the bottom of the distribution as well as the increase at the top. The ratio of hours worked between the two groups delivered by the model also fits the trend found in the data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Under soft capacity constraints, the equilibrium ranges from Bertrand competition to Cournot competition, depending upon parameters. It is shown that a unit tax potentially changes the qualitative nature of equilibrium. That is, the type of tax affects the mode of competition between firms. This effect gives rise to the result that a unit tax is sometimes an inefficient instrument. The explanation is that the tax that leads to the first-best under Cournot competition will in fact sustain Bertrand competition, and vice versa.","[Vetter, Henrik] Statsbiblioteket, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,"Vetter, H (通讯作者)，Statsbiblioteket, Victor Albecks Vej 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",hv@statsbiblioteket.dk,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Recent contributions to the literature have argued that nonliberal economies, i.e. coordinated market economies, should be expected to have less accommodating (i.e. less counter-cyclical) macroeconomic policies than liberal varieties. Using time-series cross-section data on 18 OECD countries between 1980 and 2009, this paper tests that hypothesis and, more particularly, whether the reaction of discretionary fiscal policy to macroeconomic shocks is different between liberal and nonliberal varieties of capitalism.

The analysis is based on a social insurance reform in Uruguay that extended healthcare coverage to the dependent children of registered private-sector workers. The identification strategy relies on a comparison between individuals with and without dependent children before and after the reform. The reform increased benefit-eligible registered employment by 1.6 percentage points (about 5% above the pre-reform level), mainly due to an increase in labor force participation rather than to movement from unregistered to registered employment. The shift was greater for parents with younger children and for cohabiting adults whose partners' jobs did not provide the couples' children with access to the benefit. Finally, the reform increased the incidence of underreporting of salaried earnings by about 4 percentage points (25% higher than the pre-reform level), mostly for workers employed at small firms. The increase in fiscal revenue from higher levels of registered employment was several orders of magnitude greater than the loss of revenue due to an increase in underreporting.

This paper studies the private value English premium auction (EPA) for different risk attitudes of bidders. We explicitly derive the symmetric equilibrium for bidders with CARA utilities and conduct an experimental study to test the theoretical predictions. In our experiment, subjects are sorted into risk-averse and risk-loving groups. We find that revenues in the EPA are significantly higher when bidders are risk loving rather than risk averse. These results are partly consistent with theory and confirm the general view that bidders' risk preferences constitute an important factor that affects bidding behavior and consequently also the seller's expected revenue. However, individual subjects rarely follow the equilibrium strategy and revenue in our experiment is lower than in the symmetric equilibrium. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In practice, diversity constraints are often enforced by setting hard upper bounds and hard lower bounds for each student type. We demonstrate that, with hard bounds, there might not exist assignments that satisfy standard fairness and non-wastefulness properties; and only constrained non-wasteful assignments that are fair for same type students can be guaranteed to exist. We introduce the student exchange algorithm that finds a constrained efficient assignment among such assignments. To achieve fair (across all types) and non-wasteful assignments, we propose control constraints to be interpreted as soft bounds-flexible limits that regulate school priorities dynamically. In this setting, (i) the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm produces an assignment that Pareto dominates all other fair assignments while eliciting true preferences and (ii) the school-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm finds an assignment that minimizes violations of controlled choice constraints among fair assignments.

The analysis of firm and product heterogeneity reveals that productivity drove the negative evolution of the export intensive margin to such an extent that it significantly affected trade extensive margins and postponable goods were the most affected products. In addition, the foreign demand shock suffered by exporters propagated to their import demand. Interestingly, we show that the crisis hit produced exports less than the carry-along ones and that the domestic market cushioned the downturn effects especially for larger firms.

Conceivably, massive government spending could bring the economy out of this slump as massive war spending ultimately ended the Great Depression of the 1930s. However, a far superior strategy exists: guaranteeing employment accompanied by retraining to enable all unemployed workers to become absorbed into the regular work force. Beyond ending the crisis, the superiority of this strategy is that it would institutionalize a procedure for insuring that, in an increasingly technologically dynamic and open economy, workers would possess the necessary skills for available jobs. Guaranteeing employment would also eliminate the ecological costs associated with the need to seek growth to generate employment at practically any cost. Finally, it would establish a new moral social contract, whereby everyone is granted the dignity that accompanies being a productive member of society.

We find a stable negative relationship between differences in polity and the likelihood of arms trade for the duration of the Cold War, but not in recent years. In line with these results, the global arms trade network changes drastically over the sample period in several respects: it grows more dense, clustered and decentralized over time.

In low-productivity drought prone areas where credit mainly helps smooth consumption, no relationship between credit rationing and crop productivity emerges.

Unfortunately, the number of operating rooms required for concurrent surgeries poses a significant constraint on the beneficial exchanges that may be attained. The basic insight of this paper is that incentive compatibility does not require simultaneous exchange; rather, it requires that organ donation occurs no later than the associated organ receipt. Using sequential exchanges may relax the operating room constraint and thereby increase the number of beneficial exchanges. We show that most benefits of sequential exchange can be accomplished with only two concurrent operating rooms.","[Ausubel, Lawrence M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Morrill, Thayer] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; North Carolina State University,"Ausubel, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ausubel@econ.umd.edu; Thayer_Morrill@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,19,8,9,0,7,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

Nevertheless, the size of the gender pay gap could still be underestimated as a result of not accounting for the low-wage women who have dropped out of the labor force. As shown by a large and representative set of household survey data in China, since the 1980s the female employment rate has been falling and the gap between male and female employment rates has been increasing. We estimate the gap size using Heckman's selection-correction model and bounds of the raw gender pay gap, taking into consideration the different male and female employment rates in China.

Workers may match with, and move to, particular jobs on the basis of match quality, preferences, human capital, andmobility costs. This paper implements a novel method based on complex network analysis to describe how workers move from job to job. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), I find first that the labor market is composed of four distinct segments between which job mobility is relatively unlikely. Second, these segments are not well-described on the basis of industry, occupation, demographic characteristics, or education. Third, mobility segments are associated with earnings heterogeneity, and there is evidence of positive assortative matching across segments. Fourth, the boundaries to job mobility are counter-cyclical: workers move more freely when unemployment is low. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

All adults shared consensual stereotypes about uncooperative younger adults and cooperative older adults that demonstrated wisdom of crowds. While the out-group was consistently stereotyped as relatively different and more dishonest and suspicious than observed to be, the in-group was neither consistently stereotyped more accurately nor treated with more honesty and trust.

This paper provides empirical evidence for seven Asian emerging economies from 1988 to 2006 consistent with a tariff race to the bottom driven by a competition for foreign direct investment (FDI). The identification is two-pronged. First, it is shown that tariffs on parts and components, intermediates and capital goods, crucial locational determinants for assembly firms, are correlated in competitive space, i.e. across countries at a similar level of development, but not across all countries.

It is verified, however, that consumer surplus is never improved; social welfare improves solely owing to an increase in the firms' profits in the case of linear demands.

Our results show a positive and robust effect of immigration on natives' well-being, which is not driven by local labor market characteristics. Immigration has only a weak impact on the subjective well-being of immigrant groups, meanwhile. We also examine potential threats to causality and conclude that our findings are not driven by selectivity and reverse causality. Specifically, natives are not crowded out by immigrants and the sorting of immigrants to regions with higher native happiness is negligible. We further find that the positive effect of immigration on natives' life satisfaction is a function of the assimilation of immigrants in the region. Immigration's well-being effect is higher in regions with intermediate assimilation levels and is essentially zero in regions with no or complete assimilation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the energy sector the uncertainty of future direction of changes in prices makes it difficult to include an adequate price vector in the design. We separately investigate the implication of using price vectors with increases and decreases in tariffs from current levels, on marginal value estimate from choice experiment data developed using prospect theory. In addition, we also analyse the effect of excluding the price vector on these marginal values. By and large, our results support the neoclassical theory as we find that the means of the conditional estimates of the marginal values of attributes are unaffected by the direction of the price change and from exclusion of the price attribute. However, the distributions show a larger spread of values when the choice experiment implies a tariff decrease, which may have policy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find that extensive margin (Melitz-type selection) effects are robust to relaxing the CES assumption. Intensive margin effects (market share reallocations across inframarginal firms) and competitive (markup) effects are instead fragile. An important implication is that measured productivity gains from trade opening are no longer ensured with non-CES preferences.

One purpose of the exit exams is to create a clear bar which students must pass in order to graduate. Effective exit exams may encourage marginal students to spend additional time on schooling in order to pass the exam. This study exploits state-level variations in timing of implementation to understand how students have responded to the state exit exams. This study uses the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The ATUS captures, in detail, how individuals spend their day. We find that exit exams are associated with an increase in the amount of time that students spend on educational activities by almost 20 minutes per day in the months in which exams are typically given. The increase comes mainly from an increase in time spent in school and not time spent outside of school on education-related activities. The additional time for education appears to be a trade-off with time spent watching television, which shows a significant drop in exam months for students facing exams.","[Diette, Timothy M.] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Econ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Helms, Sara E.] Samford Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, Birmingham, AL 35229 USA",Washington & Lee University; Samford University,"Diette, TM (通讯作者)，Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Econ, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",diettet@wlu.edu; shelms1@samford.edu,"Diette, Tim/J-9643-2019","Diette, Tim/0000-0002-5071-7283",,,,,21,1,3,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Flexible retirement and flexible pension schemes are in practice closely linked because of imperfect capital markets and institutional restrictions. I discuss three necessary conditions to provide insurance through flexible retirement. First, it should be possible to adjust the pension starting date at limited cost. This condition is gradually being fulfilled, as many countries are moving toward more actuarially neutral pension schemes. Second, individuals should be willing to adjust their labor supply in case of a wealth shock. This condition seems largely fulfilled, although the available empirical evidence suggests that the 'standard retirement age' is at least as important as the income effect. Third, the labor market should be able to deal with flexible individual retirement decisions. This condition is gaining importance, but has not yet received much attention in the literature. Institutions often hamper employment past the 'standard retirement age'. Moreover, the hiring rates of older workers are low and their unemployment duration is high. Institutional reforms facilitating flexible retirement opportunities are desirable from an insurance perspective.",,,,,,"van Vuuren, Daniel/0000-0002-9972-1873",,,,,100,7,8,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Whilst the original proof of its validity featured a single-agent single-stage context, its practical use has seen a wide range of implementations. Practitioners have implicitly assumed that whenever the setting and form of implementation they have chosen deviates from the original single-agent single-period proof, it remains theoretically valid. There has been virtually no debate in the practitioner literature on the theoretical validity of binary lotteries in a more general context, or on whether the form of implementation matters. The current article addresses these questions, establishes limitations on validity and suggests some design principles for future implementation of binary lotteries for the purpose of controlling risk preferences.","[Dobbs, I.

This approach takes advantage of the breakthroughs in economic theory by Georgescu-Roegen and Hicks. The step-by-step analysis of production in time proposed by Georgescu-Roegen has brought into light the idleness of capital equipment and of human resources as the main obstacle to growth, and given a robust basis to Smith's growth theory according to which the articulation between the division of labor and the extent of market is the main engine of growth. The analysis of the time dimension of production processes proposed by Hicks that focuses on the distinction between construction and utilization phases has opened the way for a comprehensive analysis of the type of disturbances - unemployment and productivity slowdown - which arise along an out-of-equilibrium growth path. These contributions provide the basis for the analysis of qualitative change as a learning process, whose evolution is not predetermined but depends on what happens along the way, that is, on the recurrent distortions in the structure of productive capacity due to co-ordination failures.

This has lead to attempts to provide explanations-using both standard economic theory and behavioral economics-for why certain individuals may be attracted to such an apparently unprofitable activity. Drawing on research in behavioral economics, in the sections that follow, we review three sets of possible interpretations for understanding the empirical facts related to the entry into, and persistence in, entrepreneurship. Differences in risk aversion provide a plausible and intuitive interpretation of entrepreneurial activity. In addition, a growing literature has begun to highlight the potential importance of overconfidence in driving entrepreneurial outcomes. Such a mechanism may appear at face value to work like a lower level of risk aversion, but there are clear conceptual differences-in particular, overconfidence likely arises from behavioral biases and misperceptions of probability distributions. Finally, nonpecuniary taste-based factors may be important in motivating both the decisions to enter into and to persist in entrepreneurship.","[Astebro, Thomas] HEC Paris, Paris, France; [Herz, Holger; Weber, Roberto A.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nanda, Ramana] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Nanda, Ramana] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; University of Zurich; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Åstebro, T (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, Paris, France.",astebro@hec.fr; holger.herz@econ.uzh.ch; RNanda@hbs.edu; roberto.weber@econ.uzh.ch,,"Astebro, Thomas/0000-0002-8077-7631; Herz, Holger/0000-0003-3495-1640",,,,,57,144,183,1,76,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

For most of the early period since Irish independence the attempt to reduce exposure to the UK was implemented through tariff protection and restrictions on foreign ownership. Inward orientation eventually ran out of steam, culminating in sustained emigration and deep recession in the 1950s. The genesis in the mid-1950s of Ireland's low corporation tax regime facilitated later trade liberalization and diversified the economy away from the UK. These developments facilitated the full convergence on UK and broader Western European living standards that was eventually achieved in the 1990s. From 1979 the UK would diverge from most of the rest of Western Europe on exchange-rate policy, and Ireland was forced to choose between the two. The resulting difficulties can be ascribed to design flaws in the European monetary project and Ireland's failure to recognize the constraints that the new regime imposed.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Barry, F (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland.",barryfg@tcd.ie,"barry, frank/Y-6289-2019","barry, frank/0000-0002-4226-5299",,,,,34,5,5,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We randomly assign referees to four groups: a control group with a six-week deadline to submit a referee report; a group with a four-week deadline; a cash incentive group rewarded with $100 for meeting the four-week deadline; and a social incentive group in which referees were told that their turnaround times would be publicly posted. We obtain four sets of results. First, shorter deadlines reduce the time referees take to submit reports substantially. Second, cash incentives significantly improve speed, especially in the week before the deadline. Cash payments do not crowd out intrinsic motivation: after the cash treatment ends, referees who received cash incentives are no slower than those in the four-week deadline group. Third, social incentives have smaller but significant effects on review times and are especially effective among tenured professors, who are less sensitive to deadlines and cash incentives. Fourth, all the treatments have little or no effect on rates of agreement to review, quality of reports, or review times at other journals. We conclude that small changes in journals' policies could substantially expedite peer review at little cost. More generally, price incentives, nudges, and social pressure are effective and complementary methods of increasing prosocial behavior.","[Chetty, Raj; Sandor, Laszlo] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Harvard University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",chetty@fas.harvard.edu; saez@econ.berkeley.edu; sandor@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,21,51,54,0,32,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

At the same time, capital-embodied technical change began to accelerate, and the United States adopted the new capital much faster than Europe. I argue that these two facts are related. The main idea is that if there is capital-embodied technical change, then the unemployment rate depends critically on how obsolete the installed capital stock is compared to the frontier. In particular, European workers initially worked with relatively obsolete capital, and so they lacked the skills required to work with frontier capital. When they lost their jobs they therefore stayed unemployed for longer than their American counterparts. I find that this channel accounts for about 70% of the discrepancy between the behavior of unemployment rates in Europe and the United States.","Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Duernecker, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",duernecker@uni-mannheim.de,,"Duernecker, Georg/0000-0002-6088-2522",,,,,32,1,1,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

In this paper we test for the existence of equity market contagion originating from the US to advanced and emerging markets during the crisis period. Using a latent factor model, we provide strong evidence of contagion effects in both advanced and emerging equity markets. In the aggregate equity market indices, contagion from the US explains a large portion of the variance in stock returns in both advanced and emerging markets. However, in the financial sector indices we find less evidence of contagion than in the aggregate indices, and this is particularly the case for the advanced markets.

In particular, the hybrid monetary model is based on the incorporation of real stock prices to enhance money demand stability and also, productivity differential, relative government spending, and real oil price to explain real exchange rate persistence. By using quarterly data over a period of high international capital mobility and volatility (1980:01-2009:04), the results show that the proposed hybrid model provides a coherent long-run relation to explain the dollar-yen exchange rate as opposed to the conventional monetary model.

The primary aim of this paper is to identify an appropriate alternative modelling approach for the patients' medical expenditures. Data were collected from Jiaojiang city, through cluster and multistage random sampling procedure, which was comprised of 4,630 enrolled rural people under NRCMS. The paper presented the first comparison of common econometric medical expenditures modelling approaches. Major findings reveal that the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) predictive accuracy appears to be better than the Finite Mixture Model (FMM) and GLM (log link) was the best performer among all approaches. It may be attributed due to the structural difference of medical expenditures between China and other developing countries compared to the developed countries. This suggests that the Chinese government may find an alternative to choose GLM approach among others to minimize the peasants' medical expenditures under NRCMS.","[Lu Wencong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Agr, Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310085, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ying, Cheng; Mazumder, Mohummed Shofi Ullah] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ying, Cheng] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Accounting Coll, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mazumder, Mohummed Shofi Ullah] Sher E Bangla Agril Univ, Dept AEIS, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Hangzhou Dianzi University; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU),"Ying, C (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Agr, Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310085, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wenclu@zju.edu.cn; chengying_hz@163.com; shofi_keron@yahoo.com,"chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023",", Mazumder/0000-0002-6989-1222",,,,,22,0,0,1,18,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Work time flexibility is seen by many as a way to promote gender equality by increasing the ability of women to exercise some control over their work time, thus facilitating their ability to participate in paid work while maintaining families. Yet, flexibility may take on very different meanings in different contexts, particularly with respect to the degree of control workers have over important aspects of their working time. This paper examines the meaning and distribution of work time flexibility for women in the United States. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the social construction and gendered nature of work time, and the complex and evolving distribution of work time in the United States. Measures of flexibility that seek to capture different aspects of workers' control over work time are then defined and examined through recent data for male and female workers from the General Social Survey (GSS).","[Peterson, Janice] Calif State Univ Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Wiens-Tuers, Barbara] Penn State Altoona, Altoona, PA USA",California State University System; California State University Fresno; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Peterson, J (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",,,,,,,,17,5,11,5,39,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Earlier this year, the government launched Our Singapore Conversation of which discussion on housing policies constitutes one major component. This conversation comes in the wake of several consecutive rounds of measures to stabilize housing prices using various instruments. This paper evaluates the main policy changes proposed and makes recommendations for housing market reforms: (i) the government need to clarify goals of housing policies and make available more detailed data on the foreign component of our population for better analysis of housing markets; (ii) the housing supply regime should target an overall effective vacancy rate that encompasses both the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and private sector; (iii) policy makers need to monitor carefully excess demand indicators for housing in addition to housing affordability indicators over the entire spectrum of incomes and household types; (iv) housing REITs should be established to provide an alternative investment option as well as to develop an efficient and affordable rental sector; and (v) in addition to macroprudential measures, owner-occupancy requirements and fiscal measures such as stamp duties and property taxes could be further utilized to reduce the foreign demand for Singapore housing and real estate.","[Phang, Sock-Yong; Lee, David; Phoon, Kok-Fai; Wee, Karol] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Cheong, Alan] Savills Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Phang, SY (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore.",,"LEE, David Kuo Chuen/E-8833-2014; PHANG, Sock Yong/D-1443-2009; PHOON, Kok Fai/D-2229-2010","Phang, Sock-Yong/0000-0001-6280-3202",,,,,16,6,7,4,67,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

On this basis we estimate the evolution of global income inequality over the past two centuries. Two sets of benchmarks about between-country inequality (the Maddison 1990 benchmark and the recent 2005 ICP round) are taken into account. We find that between 1820 and 1950, increasing per capita income is combined with increasing global inequality. After 1950, global inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient or the Theil index remains more or less constant. It also appears that the global income distribution was uni-modal in the nineteenth century, became increasingly bi-modal between 1910 and 1970 with two world wars, a depression and de-globalization, and was suddenly transformed back into a uni-modal distribution between 1980 and 2000.","[van Zanden, Jan Luiten; Foldvari, Peter; van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, NL-3984 LG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Baten, Joerg] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Utrecht University; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"van Leeuwen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Humanities, Werkhovenseweg 7, NL-3984 LG Utrecht, Netherlands.",bas.vanleeuwen1@gmail.com,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298; , Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X",,,,,57,63,67,0,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

However, many programs designed to support entrepreneurship are based on an erroneous and biased image of the entrepreneur, with important consequences for development processes and outcomes. Long-standing ideology underlying the entrepreneur as a rugged individual hero shapes not only the masculinist notion of entrepreneurship in most societies, but also the narrow focus and structure of entrepreneurship programs. Microfinance, however, is generally conceptualized as being different from other programs, particularly given its informal sector reach and common group lending model. This paper investigates the extent to which microfinance is able to build community, and to sustain individual entrepreneurs' attention to social solidarity economy. Alternative approaches to microfinance, which fundamentally restructure the way it works - specifically considering the issue of community-building - are discussed as a possible next evolution of this form of social enterprise.","South Asia Rollins College, Ctr India, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA",,"Warnecke, T (通讯作者)，South Asia Rollins College, Ctr India, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",,,,,,,,42,7,7,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

A multinomial PML is also applied to solve the zero trade issue and the presence of heteroskedasticity. The results indicate that ACFTA leads to substantial and significant trade creation.

Our findings provide no evidence that political conservatives are more charitable than political liberals as advanced by Brooks (2006). To the contrary, our results suggest that at least in terms of volunteering, political conservatives are less charitable than political liberals. We also find evidence that the adverse impacts of political conservatism on charitable behavior are exacerbated by the increasing importance of religion/religious faith in one's life.

The conventional wisdom contends that economic deprivation in southeastern Turkey is the fundamental reason for the long-running battle against the Kurdish rebels. Considering that there is limited empirical literature on the roots of terrorism in Turkey, yielding conflicting results about the claim that the main cause of terrorism is deprived economic conditions, this study aims to answer whether there is a causal relationship between income inequality and separatist terrorism in Turkey. To this end, the Global Terrorism Data Base for the period of 1973-2006, two Theil indices of pay inequality as proxy for income inequality, and the vector autoregression and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods are utilized. The results support the early findings that income inequality, a particular focus in this paper and an essential indicator of economic deprivation, is not a main cause of escalation of separatist terrorism in Turkey.","[Derin-Gure, Pinar] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Elveren, Adem Yavuz] Kahramanmaras SI Univ Kahramanmaras, Dept Econ, Kahramanmaras, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Derin-Güre, P (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ancara, Turkey.",pderin@metu.edu.tr,"Derin Gure, Pinar/V-5562-2018","Derin Gure, Pinar/0000-0001-6128-5116",,,,,53,9,9,2,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Several recent models depart from this assumption and posit that some people do not lie or at least do not lie maximally. These models invoke many different underlying motives including intrinsic lying costs, altruism, efficiency concerns, or conditional cooperation. To provide an empirically-validated microfoundation for these models, it is crucial to understand the relevance of the different potential motives. We measure the extent of lying costs among a representative sample of the German population by calling them at home. In our setup, participants have a clear monetary incentive to misreport, misreporting cannot be detected, reputational concerns are negligible and altruism, efficiency concerns or conditional cooperation cannot play a role. Yet, we find that aggregate reporting behavior is close to the expected truthful distribution suggesting that lying costs are large and widespread. Further lab experiments show that this result is not driven by the mode of communication. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The model is then used to explain the Jews' withdrawal from proselytism in the face of Christian competition in the first century CE. We review the historical evidence on conversion to Judaism before and after the first century and argue that the demise of Jewish proselytism was due not to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE but to the apostle Paul's strategic decision, in his letter to the Galatians, that Gentiles need not convert to Judaism to become Christians.","Univ Piemonte Orientale, Inst Publ Policy & Publ Choice POLIS, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Ferrero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Inst Publ Policy & Publ Choice POLIS, Via Cavour 84, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy.",ferrerom@sp.unipmn.it,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2014,67,2,,,,,204,226,,10.1111/kykl.12050,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics,AI9TG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337279300004,0

We model depositors' decision-making in a sequential framework, with three depositors located at the nodes of a network. Depositors observe the other depositors' actions only if connected by the network. Theoretically, a sufficient condition to prevent bank runs is that the second depositor to act is able to observe the first one's action (no matter what is observed). Experimentally, we find that observability of actions affects the likelihood of bank runs, but depositors' choice is highly influenced by the particular action that is being observed. Depositors who are observed by others at the beginning of the line are more likely to keep their money deposited, leading to less bank runs. When withdrawals are observed, bank runs are more likely even when the mere observation of actions should prevent them. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

Each household owns one house and wishes to live in one house; thus everyone is potentially both a buyer and a seller. In equilibrium, the distribution of prices depends on both distributions in a tractable but nontrivial manner. We show how the impact of increased income inequality on house prices depends on the shapes of the distributions, and can be inferred from data. In our empirical application we find that increased income inequality between 1998 and 2007 had a negative impact on average house prices in six US metropolitan areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sub-national regions such as the U.S. states wish to increase energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, or adapt to climate change. Evaluating sub-national policies to reduce energy use and emissions is difficult because of the large uncertainties in socioeconomic factors, technology performance and cost and energy and climate policies. Climate change itself may undercut such policies. However, assessing all of the uncertainties of large-scale energy and climate models by performing thousands of model runs can be a significant modeling effort with its accompanying computational burden. By applying fractional-factorial methods to the GCAM-USA 50-state integrated-assessment model in the context of a particular policy question, this paper demonstrates how a decision-focused sensitivity analysis strategy can greatly reduce computational burden in the presence of uncertainty and reveal the important drivers for decisions and more detailed uncertainty analysis.

Special attention is given to updated allocation and we assume that allowances can be traded with other sectors (open cap). We confirm earlier studies that output based allocation based on ex-ante data provide the same abatement incentives as auction or grandfathering and also confirm that output based allocation with updated output and ex-ante benchmarks provides as high abatement incentives as auction, but constitutes a production subsidy. However, we also find that benchmarking with updated output and updated benchmarks reduces abatement incentives somewhat, but less so than updated grandfathering. An allocation rule where the sector cap is prescribed ex-ante, for instance based on historic emissions, and distributed to installations in proportion to their updated production preserves full abatement incentives and avoids some of the costs associated with the determination of benchmarks. However, this rule also constitutes a production subsidy, which decreases with industry concentration. If a sector is split into smaller groups each with one benchmark per sub-sector, benchmarking evolves toward grandfathering. Since benchmarking is conditioned on production, this allocation method protects production from leakage, i.e. migrating to areas where firms face no emissions cost. This may actually be the most compelling reason for choosing benchmarking. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Do real-world taxes share some of their features? What policy prescriptions can be made? We study a two-period model, where the consumers and government each have separate budget constraints in the two periods, so income cannot be transferred between periods. Labor supply in both periods is chosen by consumers. The government has memory, so taxes in the first period are a function of first-period labor income, whereas taxes in the second period are a function of both first- and second-period labor incomes. The government cannot commit to future taxes. Time consistency is thus imposed as a requirement. The main results of the paper show that time-consistent incentive-compatible two-period taxes involve separation of types in the first period and a differentiated lump-sum tax in the second period, provided that the discount rate is high or utility is separable between labor and consumption. In the natural extension of the Diamond () model with quasi-linear utility functions to two periods, an equivalence of dynamic and static optimal taxes is demonstrated, and a necessary condition for the top marginal tax rate on first-period income is found.","[Berliant, Marcus] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Ledyard, John O.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91105 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); California Institute of Technology,"Berliant, M (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 1208,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",berliant@artsci.wustl.edu,,,,,,,25,13,13,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

An important question then is: when is it better to cooperate? And, once the decision to cooperate is made, how can an appropriate partner be selected? In this paper we present a model of inter-firm cooperation driven by cognitive distance, appropriability conditions and external knowledge. Absorptive capacity of firms develops as an outcome of the interaction between absorptive R&D and cognitive distance from voluntary and involuntary knowledge spillovers. Thus, we offer a revision of the original model by Cohen and Levinthal (Econ J 99(397):569-596, 1989), accounting for recent empirical findings and explicitly modeling absorptive capacity within the framework of interactive learning. We apply that to the analysis of firms' cooperation and R&D investment preferences. The results show that cognitive distance and appropriability conditions between a firm and its cooperation partner have an ambiguous effect on the profit generated by the firm. Thus, a firm chooses to cooperate and selects a partner conditional on the investments in absorptive capacity it is willing to make to solve the understandability/novelty trade-off.","[Egbetokun, Abiodun; Savin, Ivan] Univ Jena, Grad Coll Econ Innovat Change, Inst Econ, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Savin, Ivan] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Chair Econometr & Stat, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Ural Federal University,"Savin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Grad Coll Econ Innovat Change, Inst Econ, Bachstr 18k Room 216, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",ivan.savin@uni-jena.de,"Egbetokun, Abiodun/G-1146-2011; Savin, Ivan/P-9035-2016","Egbetokun, Abiodun/0000-0002-2069-7648; Savin, Ivan/0000-0002-9469-0510",,,,,45,28,31,2,77,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Sustainable diversion limits as proposed in the Australian Government's basin plan together with climate change are expected to impact on future agriculture production and development in the MDB. We developed a biophysical-economic mathematical model calibrated against the observed multi-period land use data utilising the positive mathematical programming (PMP) approach to evaluate the impacts on agricultural production activities of a range of climate events and policy options. This is an extension of our previous work where the model was calibrated against a single year and the focus was on the southern MDB only. The multi-period calibrated model has strong predictive capacity as it matches simulated irrigated area, water use and gross value of irrigated agricultural product (GVIAP) well with the observed irrigated land, water use and GVIAP for all the crops in all the regions of the MDB across the highly variable climatic conditions from 2005 to 2009. The approach will be useful in assessing economic impacts of climate change on irrigation, farmers' adaptation options and/or water policies including water markets and irrigation efficiency improvement.

Existing experimental evidence (e.g. Goeree and Offerman in Am. Econ. Rev. 92(3):625-643, 2002) demonstrates that first-price auctions with this valuation structure tend to be inefficient, and inexperienced subjects tend to bid above the break-even bidding threshold. In this paper, we compare first-price auctions with an alternative auction mechanism: the least-revenue auction. This auction mechanism shifts the risk regarding the common value of the good to the auctioneer. Such a shift is desirable when ex post negative payoffs for the winning bidder results in unfulfilled contracts, as is often the case in infrastructure concessions contracts. We directly compare these two auction formats within two valuation structures: (1) pure common value and (2) common value with a private cost. We find that, relative to first-price auctions, bidding above the break-even bidding threshold is significantly less prevalent in least-revenue auctions regardless of valuation structure. As a result, revenue in first-price auctions is higher than in least-revenue auctions, contrary to theory. Further, when there are private and common value components, least-revenue auctions are significantly more efficient than first-price auctions.","[Aycinena, Diego; Rentschler, Lucas] Univ Francisco Marroquin, Ctr Vernon Smith Econ Expt, Guatemala City 01010, Guatemala; [Baltaduonis, Rimvydas] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Econ, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA",Gettysburg College,"Rentschler, L (通讯作者)，Univ Francisco Marroquin, Ctr Vernon Smith Econ Expt, 6a Calle Final,Zona 10, Guatemala City 01010, Guatemala.",diegoaa@ufm.edu; rbaltadu@gettysburg.edu; lrentschler@ufm.edu,"Aycinena, Diego/I-9259-2014; Aycinena, Diego/KCL-1336-2024","Aycinena, Diego/0000-0001-6330-5926; Baltaduonis, Rimvydas/0000-0003-4582-7194",,,,,17,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In this paper, we study how the formation of other-regarding preferences during childhood is related to parental background. Our subjects, aged 4-12 years, are classified into other-regarding types based on simple binary-choice dictator games. The main finding is that the children of parents with low education are less altruistic, more selfish, and more likely to be weakly spiteful.

Hence, this paper develops and tests empirically several models incorporating heterogeneous expectations of agents, specifically fundamentalists and chartists, for the gold market. The empirical results show that both agent types are important in explaining historical gold prices but that the 10-year bull run of gold in the early 2000s is consistent with the presence of agents extrapolating long-term trends. Technically this paper is a further step toward providing an empirical foundation for certain assumptions used in the heterogeneous agents literature. For example, the empirical results presented in this paper compare the economical and statistical significance of numerous switching variable specifications that are generally only introduced ad hoc.

By the end of the 20th century, the concept of labor hoarding had become an accepted part of economists' explanations of the workings of labor markets and of the relationship between labor productivity and economic fluctuations. The emergence of this concept involved the conjunction of three key elements: the fact that measured labor productivity was found to be procyclical, rising during expansions and falling during contractions; a perceived contradiction with the theory of the neoclassical firm in a competitive economy; and a possible explanation based on optimizing behavior on the part of firms. Each of these three elements-fact, contradiction, and explanation-has a history of its own, dating back to at least the opening decades of the twentieth century. Telling the story of the emergence of the modern labor hoarding concept requires recounting these three histories, histories that involve the work of economists motivated by diverse purposes and often not mainly, if at all, concerned with the questions that the labor hoarding concept was ultimately used to address. As a final twist to the story, the long-standing positive relationship between labor productivity and output in the US economy began to disappear in the late 1980s; and during the Great Recession, labor productivity rose while the economy contracted.","Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Biddle, JE (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",biddle@msu.edu,,,,,,,41,34,36,2,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Our strategy controls for inherent differences in overall levels of impatience across discount functions, which thereby allows us to isolate the pure effect of self-control problems. We argue that self-control problems, in their pure form as we identify them, can have a very surprising effect on intertemporal choices. Our method reveals that differences in decision making that could be attributed to self-control problems are at least partly (and perhaps entirely) just an artifact of an uncontrolled comparison.

The objective of the City of Prague is to find such a set of criteria and such a set of relative weights that estimate the expected cost of local public administration best. The objective of each city district is subsidy maximization by influencing the criteria and weights. Two quantitative methods that set the weights without participation of decision makers are presented. The first method is based on the multiple-criteria decision making and the second one on the zero-sum gains DEA model. The illustrative calculations for the year 2012 are presented. An application of the multiple-criteria decision making model requires re-allocation of 8.3% of the total subsidy budget in comparison to the real subsidy values in the year 2012. An application of the zero-some gains DEA model requires re-allocation of 14.0% of the total subsidy to city districts. We are not able to offer any definitive answers about which allocation model is the best one, however, an analysis of the subsidy allocation process can help us in understanding the nature of the subsidy allocation problem and its potential weaknesses.","Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dlouhy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",dlouhy@vse.cz,"Dlouhy, Martin/I-3913-2018","Dlouhy, Martin/0000-0003-1028-1822",,,,,13,3,3,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Investment decisions are made under uncertainty and have to be made over time. This papers provides a framework for taking uncertainty, risk aversion, and the timing of investment explicitly into account. First, it evaluates various access price policies in a framework in which the incremental value over the legacy network is uncertain. There, policies that make usage by non-investing firms optional must ensure as well that this optionality is efficiently used. Second, introducing risk aversion, the access price structure turns out to be critical for the risk profile of the investing telecom operator and of the access-seeking alternative operator. Third, some implications of the time structure of access payments are derived. Policies must ensure that non-investing firms do not excessively delay seeking access. Generally, efficiency of usage can be increased when making fees contingent on observable characteristics of market development. To the extent that this is not based on volume, this need not dampen competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We construct a panel data that follows children between ages 3 and 59 months in 1993 through the 1997 and 2000 waves of the Indonesian Family Life Survey. We use this data to identify the various child-level, household-level and community-level factors that affect children's health. Our findings indicate that household income has a large and statistically significant role in explaining improvements in HAZ. We also find a strong positive association between parental height and HAZ. At the community level, we find that provision of electricity and the availability of paved roads are positively associated with improvements in HAZ. Finally, in comparison to community-level factors, household-level characteristics play a large role in explaining the variation in HAZ. These findings suggest that policies that address the demand-side constraints have greater potential to improve children's health outcomes in the future.","[Mani, Subha] Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Mani, Subha] Fordham Univ, Ctr Int Policy Studies, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Mani, Subha] Univ Penn, Ctr Populat Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Fordham University; Fordham University; University of Pennsylvania,"Mani, S (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",smani@fordham.edu,,,,,,,47,11,13,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The paper examines the role of real exchange rate, exchange rate volatility and the reaction functions of central banks using dynamic panel estimation techniques. The results indicate that the output gap offers more useful information than the inflation gap in setting interest rates for inflation targeters, implying that the real term is more important than the nominal term. In turn, this suggests that an increase in interest rate can be wielded swiftly to reduce real gross domestic product and suppress inflation. The real exchange rate appears as a weaker determinant in setting interest rates for non-inflation targeters. Inflation targeters experienced lower exchange rate volatility compared with non-targeters in the ASEAN, which implies that implementation costs to their domestic economies may be marginally lower. Meanwhile, the non-targeters follow a mixed strategy as both the inflation and real exchange rate are used as instruments to set the interest rates.","[Poon, Wai Ching] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Poon, WC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia.",poon.wai.ching@monash.edu,"Poon, Wai Ching/HPE-5402-2023",,,,,,53,4,4,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The main causes of the crisis were the large and growing external and fiscal imbalances. The primary factors accounting for the growing current-account deficit were declines in competitiveness and in public-sector saving. Moreover, prior to the outbreak of the crisis, the Greek banking sector had sound fundamentals. Also, in contrast to the situation in other countries, in Greece the sovereign crisis led to a banking crisis. The paper then (i) takes stock of the considerable progress that Greece has made in addressing its external and fiscal imbalances, and (ii) describes the strategy developed by Bank of Greece to transform the banking system. It is shown that implementation of the Bank's strategy has led to a major restructuring of the banking system, allowing it to become efficient and competitive.

The discussion has often been implicitly framed in terms of the size of the potential multiplier. Contributing to the debate, this article provides empirical estimates on the size of fiscal multipliers in the UK across various macroeconomic states during the last 50 years. The results show that since the 1980s positive government spending shocks have had a positive effect on output, with a short-run multiplier value around unity since early 2000. There is also little evidence of private consumption being crowded out. The results imply that recessions could be further aggravated if the government retrenches spending in the midst of the downturn.

And whether the CER collaborations could improve the performance of participants is another focus of our study. This paper provides a questionnaire survey about CER inter-firm collaborations on energy intensive industries in China. Three regression models including Multiple Linear Regression, Binary Choice Model, and Ordinal Choice Regression are employed to identify the determinants that drive or impede the implementation of CER collaborations. The results show that inter-firm CER collaborations are generally at an infancy stage in China. The main driver for CER collaborations derives from the CER demands of other stakeholders in the industrial chains. And the lack of infrastructure and mechanism is the main barrier that impedes the inter-firm collaborations. Moreover, CER collaborations through industrial symbiosis play a positive role in improving economic performance. However, the effects are to a large extent related to the improved environmental performance through the CER collaborations. Our results also indicate that there is much room for industrial firms to conduct CER collaborations in China, and market tools are somewhat more effective than compulsive regulations for promoting CER collaborations.

This paper extends traditional model for estimation of patent value. We classify patentees by technology level: Patentees with low technology level are motivated to imitate patentees with high technology level. This leads to an early lapse of patent right by patentees with both high and low technology level. With this model, we estimate the value of invention patents in China. Although patent value of Chinese firms is lower than that of foreign firms, the differences are not as large. This is mainly because of the existence of potential patent value. This value is dropped, since the motivation of imitating foreign patents leads to the lapse of their own patents. Technology contained in the patent would thus not be further developed. The infringement behavior is more likely to occur in technology fields with less technology gap between Chinese and foreign firms, which may be due to an easier copy of technology. The strengthening of patent protection works, as two patent law amendments in 1993 and 2001 reduces the infringement. Policy implications are made at the end of the study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

First, we show that the number of antidumping initiations from the labor intensive industries increases when there is a left-wing government in power. In addition, the evidence on the governments' decision to impose antidumping duty demonstrates that the increase in the leftist orientation of the governments is associated with an increase in the likelihood of an affirmative antidumping outcome from the petitions of labor intensive industries. Although antidumping is an administrative protection which includes a set of necessary procedures and rules to follow, our findings clearly point out the political bias in AD actions in the form of partisan preferences.

From this microeconomic analysis, we derive a regulatory policy. This policy has two consequences at the macro level: on one hand, it has a certain stabilizing effects on oil and US dollar markets, limiting the number of speculative transactions and their size; on the other hand, it induces the speculators to find agreements with real economic agents, which are profitable for both parts. Moreover, we propose that the tax is mostly re-directed to support the real economy. So, the aim of this paper appears twofold: by using Game Theory, we suggest to a pair of economic agents a way to gain in a market, also in presence of a hard taxation on the financial transactions, proposing, at the same time, to normative authority, a method to limit the instability of oil and U.S. Dollar markets and to help real economy. Our idea, at the micro-economic level, is to exploit the hedging actions to obtain a profit, limiting, at the same time, at a macro-level, the speculative attacks on oil and U.S. Dollar markets. These goals are reached by the introduction of well designed financial transactions tax. In particular, we focus on a real economic subject (Multinational Air) and on an investment bank (Bank). The solutions collectively efficient are determined, at a micro-level, by certain agreements between the two economic subjects. Specifically, after an agreement which allows to obtain the maximum collective profit of the interaction, we propose and analyze four different possible fair divisions of this gain, by adopting the Kalai-SmorodinsIcy method.

Separating these welfare costs requires dealing with degenerate bivariate distributions. Levi's Continuity Theorem and the Disintegration Theorem allow us to adequately define the one-dimensional limiting marginal distributions. Under Normality, we show that the parameters of the original marginal distributions are not affected, providing the means for calculating separately the welfare costs of business-cycle fluctuations and of economic growth variation. Our empirical results show that, if we consider only transitory shocks, the welfare cost of business cycles is much smaller than previously thought. Indeed, we found it to be negative - -0.03% of per-capita consumption! On the other hand, we found that the welfare cost of economic-growth variation is relatively large. Our estimate for reasonable preference-parameter values shows that it is 0.71% of consumption - US$ 208.98 per person, per year. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis shows that the interaction between corruption and governance shapes the efficiency of public spending, which in turn, determines the growth effects of corruption. Specifically, corruption improves economic efficiency only when the actual government size is above the optimal level. It implies that a growth-maximising level of corruption is possible. This paper also finds that the incidence of corruption declines with economic development. This is because with economic development the wage rate rises and makes private rent seeking costs higher, thereby, discouraging corruption. The main policy implication is that targeting tax evaders instead of bureaucrats is more effective in terms of both reducing corruption and improving the growth potential of an economy.

Using annual data for 73 economies spanning the period 1975-2011, we find that the impact of finance on economic development is generally stronger in high-income than low-income economies. However, allowing for intra-group variations reveals the importance of other factor variables in explaining the FD link. For instance, increasing financial development strengthens the FD link while increasing government size weakens it. Moreover, the FD link could even be negative if low- and lower-middle-income economies have very large governments or are extremely open to international trade. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper builds a model that incorporates labor training into the proximity-concentration tradeoffs to analyze the entry mode of multinationals to a foreign country. Production requires both skilled labor and unskilled labor.. A multinational pursuing FDI needs to provide training to some workers in the host country to equip them with skills that are specific to the production of the firm. Labor training and skill specificity lead to contract friction. It is shown that in skilled labor-intensive industries, FDI increases along with the economic development level of the host country, whereas in unskilled labor-intensive industries, the reverse is true. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for the empirical findings on the prevalence of North-North FDI in skilled labor-industries and North-South FDI in unskilled labor-intensive industries.","[Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; University of International Business & Economics,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qliu1997@gmail.com; larryqiu@hku.hk,,,,,,,33,3,4,3,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

However, at the solution we propose, an informed firm can take advantage of its superior information: it can choose the extent to which it concentrates its employment offers to workers of different types. The probabilities that offers to workers of different types produce a hire are treated parametrically by firms who have correct expectations about them, and firms forego the wage when they extend an offer whether the offer is successful or not.

Sustained growth comes from the feedback between the endogenously determined distribution of productivity, as evolved from past search decisions, and an optimal, forward-looking search policy.

Instead of using output data it is preferred to focus on the economic sentiment indicator (ESI), a forward-looking, survey-based variable consistently available from 1985. The cyclical nature of the ESI allowed the analyis of the presence or not of synchronicity among country pairs before and after the onset of the financial crisis. The results show that ESI movements were mostly synchronous before 2008 but they exhibit a breakdown after 2008, with this feature being more prominent in Greece. It is also found that, after the political maneuvering of the past two years, a cycle re-integration or re-synchronization is on the way. An analysis of the evolution of the synchronicity measures indicates that they can potentially be used to identify sudden phase breaks in ESI co-movement and they can offer a signal as to when the EU economies are getting in or out of sync.","[Thomakos, Dimitrios D.] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Econ, Peloponnese, Greece; [Papailias, Fotis] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Peloponnese; Queens University Belfast,"Thomakos, DD (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Dept Econ, Peloponnese, Greece.",thomakos@uop.gr; f.papailias@qub.ac.uk,,"Papailias, Fotis/0000-0003-3183-3331; Thomakos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-2896-8163",,,,,16,6,6,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Through this analysis, I find the following results. First, both these two factors affect Japanese firm investments. Second, convex adjustment costs parameter is estimated at a very small level. Third, this small convex adjustment costs lead to the model introduced in Wang and Wen (2012), which insists that the firm investments are determined by the upper bound of the borrowing constraints.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan",Kyoto University,"Mizobata, H (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan.",hmizobata@kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Mizobata, Hirokazu/AAU-9754-2021","Mizobata, Hirokazu/0000-0002-8043-986X",,,,,21,2,2,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use multivariate cointegration techniques to estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) and identify separate demand and supply relationships for consumer loans. We introduce demand and supply-related shifts in parameters through the inclusion of appropriate dummy variables and trends in the long-run relationships. We partly deviate from the typical Johansen procedure and estimate the model in two steps. We find that the theoretical exclusion and coefficient-size restrictions on the demand and supply cointegrating vectors are valid. Our results are consistent with the operation of a bank lending channel in Greece.

However, these shocks eventually lead to lower real domestic output with factors of production moving out of the nonresource sectors and into the resource sector, resulting in a fall in nonresource sector output which is not fully offset by the rise in resource sector output.

Despite their attractive properties, these products have met with low demand. We consider the frequent situation where farmers are members of groups with common interests. We show that this creates strategic interactions among group members in deciding to insure that reduce the demand for insurance for two reasons. One is free riding due to positive externalities on other group members when a member chooses to insure. The other is potential coordination failure because it may not be profitable for a risk-averse member to insure if the other members do not. As a consequence, we argue that the demand for insurance against common shocks could increase if the insurance policy were sold to groups rather than to individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper tests for the endogeneity of the household information set in a context where household members cannot observe each other easily: spousal information in the context of split urban migration in Kenya. Based on unique data, it finds that split migrant couples in the Nairobi slums invest considerable resources into information acquisition substituting visits, monitoring by siblings, and budget submissions before remitting. Comparisons of pre-marital search characteristics between current split and joint migrants are consistent with the hypothesis that those anticipating split migration change their marital search behavior to mitigate the consequences of pending imperfect information.

We track impacts of two treatments - training only and training plus a cash grant - over two years. For women in business, training changes business practices but has no impact on business profits, sales or capital stock. The grant plus training combination increases business profitability in the first eight months, but this impact dissipates in the second year.

We measure financial development using the size, lending efficiency, term structure of bank loans and degree of state intervention in financial resource allocation, respectively. We find that a larger scale and greater efficiency of bank lending and less state intervention facilitate while the relative abundance of long-term credit deteriorates exporter survival. These effects are more pronounced for private exporters compared with state-owned exporters. For foreign-invested exporters, weakened state intervention is of relatively great importance. We attribute this disproportional impact to the government's intervention in funding investment and the distortional lending of banks, which varies across regions and industries with different levels of presence of state-owned enterprises.","[Deng, Ziliang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Lei] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Hou, L (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lei.hou.lmu@gmail.com,,"Deng, Ziliang/0000-0002-4767-2803",,,,,73,2,3,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The strength of the impact depends on the inclusion of the data from the years of the recent financial and economic crisis.","[Errit, Gertrud; Uuskuela, Lenno] Bank Estonia, Econ & Res Dept, EE-15095 Tallinn, Estonia",Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Uusküla, L (通讯作者)，Bank Estonia, Estonia Pst 13, EE-15095 Tallinn, Estonia.",lenno.uuskyla@eestipank.ee,,"Uuskula, Lenno/0000-0002-0320-2527",,,,,19,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

We analyze how different combinations of tariffs - on imported consumption goods, intermediate inputs, and capital goods - and taxes - on consumption, labor income and capital income - affect the transitional and long-run welfare. We report three main findings. First, trade liberalization programs financed by consumption and labor income taxes tend to result in substantial welfare gains, but financing the lost tariff revenue through capital income taxes can have an adverse impact on welfare. Second, a significant fraction of welfare changes is due to transitional effects stemming from the allocation of resources in response to changes in tariffs and taxes. Third, trade liberalization and fiscal reform programs often translate into much larger welfare gains in countries that are more open to international financial markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This is relevant because the initial just-identifying orthogonality conditions are untestable, whereas their validity is required when testing the orthogonality of additional instruments by so-called overidentification restriction tests. Moreover, these tests have limited power when samples are small, especially when instruments are weak. Distinguishing between conditional and unconditional settings, we analyze the limiting distribution of inconsistent IV and examine normal first-order asymptotic approximations to its density in finite samples. For simple classes of models we compare these approximations with their simulated empirical counterparts over almost the full parameter space. The latter is expressed in measures for: model fit, simultaneity, instrument invalidity, and instrument weakness. Our major findings are that for the accuracy of large sample asymptotic approximations instrument weakness is much more detrimental than instrument invalidity. Also, IV estimators obtained from strong but possibly invalid instruments are usually much closer to the true parameter values than those obtained from valid but weak instruments.","[Kiviet, Jan F.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Kiviet, Jan F.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Niemczyk, Jerzy] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Nanyang Technological University; University of Amsterdam; European Central Bank,"Kiviet, JF (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,"Kiviet, Jan/B-8865-2015","Kiviet, Jan/0000-0001-8827-9808",,,,,37,4,5,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0731-9053,,978-1-78441-182-4; 978-1-78441-183-1,ADV ECONOMETRICS,,,2014,33,,,,,,425,490,,10.1108/S0731-905320140000033013,0.0,,,66,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4EO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360559300014,0

This approach is based on the application of the results of continuous-time version of large deviations theory to the linear diffusion approximation of the original discrete-time dynamics under learning. We characterize escape dynamics by analytically deriving the most probable escape point and mean escape time. The approximation is tested on the Phelps problem of a government controlling inflation while adaptively learning a misspecified Phillips curve, studied previously by Sargent (1999) and Cho et al. (2002) (henceforth, CWS), among others. We compare our results with simulations extended to very low values of the constant gain and show that, for the lowest gains, our approach approximates simulations relatively well. We express reservations regarding the applicability of any approach based on large deviations theory to characterizing escape dynamics for economically plausible values of constant gain in the model of CWS when escapes are not rare. We show that for these values of the gain it is possible to derive first passage times for learning dynamics reduced to one dimension without resort to large deviations theory. This procedure delivers mean escape time results that fit the simulations closely. We explain inapplicability of large deviations theory by insufficient averaging near the point of self-confirming equilibrium for relatively large gains which makes escapes relatively frequent, suggest the changes which might help approaches based on the theory to work better in this gain interval, and describe a simple heuristic method for determining the range of constant gain values for which large deviations theory could be applicable.

By using several dynamic versions of three macroeconomic exchange rate models, it is demonstrated that dynamic specifications outperform the corresponding static models but improvement in the forecasting power may not be sufficient for the dynamic models to perform better than the random walk. The results are explained by suggesting that any dynamic specification or transformation of the static model leads to the introduction of a lagged dependent variable, which in effect is a random walk component. The analysis leads to the conclusion that it is implausible to aim at beating the random walk by augmenting a static model with a random walk component.","[Moosa, Imad; Burns, Kelly] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Moosa, I (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",imad.moosa@rmit.edu.au,,"Burns, Kelly/0000-0003-4031-3442",,,,,28,17,17,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study concludes that the short-run and long-run relationships reveal the presence of a negative relationship between the demand of international tourists to GMS and the substitute price of the whole region. Therefore, GMS is a complementary destination for international tourists. In addition, Thailand's political instability positively affects the tourist arrivals from China and Korea in the short-run. This study suggests that the members of GMS countries should concentrate on integrated destination policy to enhance the level of tourism competitiveness in the region.

There is a compulsory requirement for making an evaluation applying such methods: availability of other alternatives for making a comparison. Nevertheless, frequently other alternatives are not available when the evaluated object is unique, and no analogous objects are present. In such cases the use of MCDM methods is not possible. The new proposed in this paper methodology of the absolute evaluation allows evaluating unique objects and processes, thus providing new possibilities for application known MCDA methods. For example, the evaluation of the dynamics of attractiveness based on the absolute evaluation can be more useful than the relative one as the comparison is being made with invariable objects rather than with the ones which can substantially change over time. In addition, the absolute evaluation is the only possible solution in such cases, when other objects for comparison are not available. The presented in the paper approach therefore provides a wider range of possible solutions for a decision-maker. In the proposed methodology the method TOPSIS was used as the most appropriate MCDM method for such evaluations. Proves of distinct features of the method are provided. The results of the absolute MCDM evaluation are compared with the results of the relative MCDM evaluation.","[Podviezko, Askoldas; Podvezko, Valentinas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-12230 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Podviezko, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-12230 Vilnius, Lithuania.",askoldas@gmail.com; valentinas.podvezko@vgtu.lt,"Podviezko, Askoldas/F-6197-2010",,,,,,43,27,27,1,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this article, we report an environment which is different from all other environments previously known in which exchange asymmetry is not observed. In this environment, participants knew at the time of making exchange decisions that they will have an opportunity to reverse their decisions. We find significant differences in exchange asymmetry in this environment, and an environment in which exchange decisions were final. Such differences suggest that anticipated regret theory provides an adequate explanation for exchange asymmetry which is often reported in the laboratory experiments.

Our results show that the Polish central bank responds more strongly to the level inflation when the level of inflation is relatively high. We find very weak evidence that the level of inflation reacts more strongly to the output gap when the output gap is relatively high.

This study concentrates on the apparel industry, since its economic challenges and opportunities differ from those of the textile industry. The analysis employs a transcendental logarithmic cost function to investigate the presence of scale economies and the interrelationships among inputs of domestic capital, labour and intermediate goods as well as outsourced intermediate products for the Spanish apparel industry and discusses the implications for its future competitiveness and the demand for domestic inputs. The results are consistent with diseconomies of scale or, in the case of one model, possibly constant returns to scale, indicating that some contraction of the industry due to international competition will not raise unit costs. All of the inputs except for capital and intermediate goods were found to be substitutes. An important finding is that the cross elasticity values of both labour and domestic intermediate goods with respect to the price of outsourced goods have risen over time, indicating an increased sensitivity of the quantity demanded of these home-country inputs to the price of imported intermediate goods. It follows that domestic input markets will be more substantially affected by international prices for outsourced inputs as the industry tries to maintain its competitiveness in the global environment.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,64,2,2,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To take a further step, these three models are adjusted for calculating the correspondingly macro-economic cost of environmental regulation. The estimation results show that at present, the level of China's environmental regulation is relatively low, and an enhancing of environmental regulation would lead to a sufficient increase of China's regional TFEE with an enormous economic cost as its price. That means in China, the nationwide environmental stress is high, and the regulation cost is very huge. Strengthening environmental regulation would inevitably have some negative influences on China's economy in the short run.

This paper examines the behavioral response to male circumcision, a major HIV prevention policy currently being implemented throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Contrary to the presumption of risk compensation, we find that the response due to the perceived reduction in HIV transmission appears to have been a reduction in risky sexual behavior. We suggest a mechanism for this finding: circumcision may reduce fatalism about acquiring HIV/AIDS and increase the salience of the tradeoff between engaging in additional risky behavior and avoiding acquiring HIV. We also find what appears to be a competing effect that does not operate through the circumcision recipient's belief about the reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

New insights from the Tunisian manufacturing industries,ECONOMIC SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Labor demand; Employment volatility; Skill structure; Trade openness; Foreign direct investment; Tunisia,INSTRUMENTAL-VARIABLE ESTIMATION; TRADE LIBERALIZATION; PANEL-DATA; INCOME INEQUALITY; WAGE INEQUALITY; SPECIALIZATION; IMPACT; ELASTICITIES; TECHNOLOGY; INVESTMENT,"The central aim of this paper is to assess the effects of economic globalization on the level and volatility of labor demand for different skill groups in Tunisia. Using a panel dataset covering six manufacturing industries between 1983 and 2009, three main findings are reported. First, exports and imports exert a positive impact only on the semi-skilled and skilled labor demand while foreign direct investment flows increase the demand for semiskilled and unskilled workers. Second, the regional analysis suggests that exports to the European Union boost the demand for the semi-skilled and skilled labor. Imports from the rest of the world exert similar effects on the demand for these two categories of workers. It emerges also that imports from the European Union lead to a higher demand for skilled labor, which gives support to the validity of the skill-enhancing trade hypothesis in Tunisian industries. Finally, our findings suggest that both exports and imports rise the employment volatility associated with skilled workers. On the other hand, there is a weak evidence of increased employment volatility as a result of foreign direct investment flows. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The article then considers the view of money as a creature of the state, in two versions, which connect money to contracts or to taxes, respectively. Finally, it further explores the monetary foundations of a market economy, the conventional foundation of money, and the role of the state. Acknowledging that money is ultimately or fundamentally a convention requires recognizing limits to the state's ability to impose its money on the private agents. At the same time, the state is usually in a much better position than any private agent to influence the process through which the convention of acceptability of money emerges and is reproduced. A stronger proposition is that without state money there would be no stable money in a market economy. Both the fundamental conventionality of money and the essential role of the state can be thus emphasized.","Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dequech, D (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Dequech, David/D-2312-2012","Dequech, David/0000-0003-2507-6688",,,,,24,8,8,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We show that the change from a private system of old-age insurance to a public system of social security has favoured the rise in capital accumulation while also reducing cyclical instability in countries where longevity is large enough. In contrast, when adult mortality is high such a change makes an economy with public pensions more prone to be subject to fluctuations, while also reducing the steady-state stock of capital and GDP per worker. In addition, since the old-age insurance motive seems to prevail also in developed countries with long-lived individuals such as Italy, our results may also be of interest for pension policies.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza & Econ, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Pisa; University of Genoa,"Fanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; luca.gori@unige.it,,"Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,53,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a substantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson that involves embracing a framework- driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. First, I discuss Ostrom's work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a discussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend Ostrom's work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free- rider allegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are manifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment.","Yeshiva Univ, Benjamin N Cardozo Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA",Yeshiva University,"Frischmann, BM (通讯作者)，Yeshiva Univ, Benjamin N Cardozo Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",frischma@yu.edu,,,,,,,36,16,20,2,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The focus of the analysis is on whether or not the historical process has remained consistent through time, and whether or not that process can be obviously linked to the provisions of the 1998 Competition Act. Initial results point to behaviour that is not consistent over the time period considered; however, those inconsistencies are removed, once additional measures of market contestibility, associated with the 1998 Competition Act are included in the analysis. The final results suggest that the commission is less likely to approve mergers that they link to markets that are less contestable. In addition to protecting competition, the commission is simultaneously protecting other public interests. Therefore, our research supports the hypothesis that the commission consistently applies its legislative remit.","[Grimbeek, Sunel; Koch, Steve] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Hatfield, Gauteng, South Africa; [Grimbeek, Richard] Univ Pretoria, Dept Stat, ZA-0028 Hatfield, Gauteng, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Pretoria,"Koch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, Gauteng, South Africa.",steve.koch@up.ac.za,,"Koch, Steven/0000-0002-2097-4027",,,,,29,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The problem is more acute in some economically fast-growing Asian countries where the fertility decline has been more rapid and the current fertility rates have reached levels that are unprecedented in recent history. In this paper, data from a unique household survey have been used to understand the determinants of low fertility in one such country: Singapore. The total fertility rate in Singapore has dropped from 4.7 children per woman in 1965 to 1.2 in 2011. This is well below the replacement level of 2.1 and one of the lowest in the world. The authors identify three key determinants of fertility in Singapore: (1) age at marriage; (2) household income; and (3) number of siblings' children. They find that fertility is negatively related to age at marriage and positively related to the number of siblings' children. The relationship between fertility and household income is U-shaped: the relationship is negative for household incomes of up to S$ 21 000 (in 2010 Singapore dollars) and positive for higher incomes.","[Hashmi, Aamir Rafique] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Mok, Wen Jie] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ Alumnus, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Hashmi, AR (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",aamir@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,45,3,3,1,33,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Future tax revenues and fiscal expenditures are projected using regression models estimated from past data. The fiscal situation is called unsustainable if the outstanding amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) becomes higher than the level of private sector financial assets. We focus on the general account of the central government, which is the source of JGB issues. We find that the higher the economic growth, the more likely it is that the fiscal situation is sustainable. When a larger portion of interest income is reinvested in JGBs, the chance is higher that the fiscal situation is sustainable. Most importantly, raising the consumption tax to 20% guarantees fiscal sustainability in most cases. Our analysis shows that without a consumption tax hike beyond the 10% rate, a fiscal crisis will be almost a certainty, even with a real economic growth rate of 2% despite a shrinking labor force. A reasonably quick hike of the consumption tax, namely a hike by 1% a year, up to 20%, combined with high or moderate economic growth rates, seems to keep the economy out of a fiscal crisis, where a moderate growth rate is defined to be generated by a productivity increase per working-age population of 1.9%, which was the average during the Koizumi years.","[Hoshi, Takeo] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ito, Takatoshi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Stanford University; University of Tokyo,"Ito, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tito@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,22,16,16,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

This is done based on assumptions about the qualitative responses of variables to structural shocks that are consistent with many different economic theories. Impulse responses of output to a permanent shock typically behave in a particular way before World War I that is unusual compared to post-World War II responses. Also, permanent shocks typically explain a larger share of output variance in that earlier period. We show these two empirical results support the hypothesis that a positive (negative) aggregate demand shock had a permanent positive (negative) effect on output in the pre-World War I period. Thus further support is obtained for that hypothesis based on more robust empirical findings and less restrictive structural assumptions. Another empirical result is that impulse responses from the data for post-World War II developed economies are typically qualitatively consistent with the effects of structural shocks from a standard textbook macro model. We show that Blanchard and Quah's statistical model will obtain impulse responses that appear consistent with simple textbook theories as the parameter measuring aggregate demand's long-run output effect is varied over a specific range. This analysis provides a range of non-neutralities for which results from Blanchard and Quah decompositions of output could be mistaken as structural. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Perturbation of the nonlinear moving average policy function provides a direct mapping from a history of innovations to endogenous variables, decomposes the contributions from individual orders of uncertainty and nonlinearity, and enables familiar impulse response analysis in nonlinear settings. When the linear approximation is saddle stable and free of unit roots, higher order terms are likewise saddle stable and first order corrections for uncertainty are zero. We derive the third order approximation explicitly, examine the accuracy of the method using Euler equation tests, and compare with state space approximations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper extends previous studies by assuming supply and use tables (SUTs rather than I-O tables or input coefficients matrices) to be stochastic. This is a natural starting point because SUTs have become the basic data sources for I-O applications. In a Monte Carlo simulation experiment, a given SUT is randomized in two different ways and the effects are determined for eight different multiplier matrices. The analysis is carried out for Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Finland, using their SUTs for 2006. The findings indicate that, in general, biases are statistically significant but negligibly small. This corroborates earlier findings obtained for stochastic I-O tables.","[Rueda-Cantuche, Jose M.; Amores, Antonio F.] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ Quantitat Methods & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain; [Dietzenbacher, Erik] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Fernandez, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Oviedo, Spain; [Rueda-Cantuche, Jose M.; Amores, Antonio F.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; University of Groningen; University of Oviedo; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Rueda-Cantuche, JM (通讯作者)，Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ Quantitat Methods & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain.",jmruecan@upo.es,"Dietzenbacher, Erik/AAK-6681-2021; Amores, Antonio F./D-1068-2010","Amores, Antonio F./0000-0002-0216-4098; Dietzenbacher, Erik/0000-0001-8874-4175",,,,,33,7,8,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The model predicts that fiscal policy is counter-cyclical with debt increasing in recessions and decreasing in booms. Public spending increases in booms and decreases during recessions, while tax rates decrease during booms and increase in recessions. In both booms and recessions, fiscal policies are set so that the marginal cost of public funds obeys a submartingale. When calibrated to the US economy, the model broadly matches the empirical distribution of debt and also its negative correlation with output. However, the predictions of pro-cyclical spending and counter-cyclical taxation do not find empirical support. The calibrated model generates the same fit of the data as a benevolent government model in which the government faces an exogenous lower bound on debt. Nonetheless, the two models have very different comparative static implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we pay attention to the evolution of budget deficit, taxes and capital spending around elections. Using a sample of the Spanish largest municipalities in 1994-2009, we find that the balanced budget rule has not dampened the political budget cycle in budget deficit. Therefore, our results indicate that although governments are constrained by such rule they engage in electoral-induced fiscal manipulation. In non-electoral years, they create room for manoeuvre to implement expansionary fiscal policies in electoral years. Specifically, there is saving in the pre-electoral year and deficit increase in the electoral year. This has been achieved largely through tax and fee increases during the pre-electoral year and by shifting the bulk of the capital spending increased from the pre-electoral year to the election year. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the balanced budget rule has succeeded in limiting the budget deficit.","[Benito, Bernardino; Bastida, Francisco; Vicente, Cristina] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Benito, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",benitobl@um.es; alba@um.es; cristina.v.o@um.es,"Benito, Bernardino/K-9416-2014; Bastida, Francisco/K-9670-2014","Benito, Bernardino/0000-0003-2165-994X; Bastida, Francisco/0000-0001-9875-3817","Spanish National R&D Plan (Ministry of Science and Innovation) [ECO2010-17463, ECO2010-20522]",Spanish National R&D Plan (Ministry of Science and Innovation),This study has benefited from the financial support of the Spanish National R&D Plan through the research projects ECO2010-17463 and ECO2010-20522 (Ministry of Science and Innovation).,,56,19,22,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2013,66,4,,,,,467,496,,,,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,VI4GV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000484790400001,0

Foreign investors from a capital-rich North can either purchase productive assets in a capital-poor South and transfer their capital within integrated multinational firms or they can form joint ventures with local asset owners. The South is ruled by an autocratic elite that may use its political power to expropriate productive assets. The expropriation risk lowers the incentive to provide specific capital in an integrated firm and distorts the decision between joint ventures and integrated production. We determine the equilibrium risk of expropriation in this framework and the resulting pattern of international production.

If the institution governs only its members, players have an incentive to free ride on the institution formation of others and the social dilemma is simply shifted to a higher level. Addressing this second-order social dilemma, we study the effectiveness of three different minimum participation requirements: (1) full participation/unanimity rule; (2) partial participation; (3) unanimity first and in case of failure partial participation. While unanimity is most effective once established, one might suspect that a weaker minimum participation rule is preferable in practice as it might facilitate the formation of the institution. The data of our laboratory experiment do not support this latter view, though. In fact, weakening the participation requirement does not increase the number of implemented institutions. Thus, we conclude that the most effective participation requirement is the unanimity rule which leaves no room for free riding on either level of the social dilemma. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A preference relation rationalizes a data set provided that for every observed consumption bundle, all strictly preferred bundles are more expensive than the observed bundle. Our main result is that data sets can be rationalized by a smooth nontransitive preference relation if and only if prices can normalized such that the law of demand is satisfied. Market data sets consist of finitely many observations of price vectors, lists of individual incomes and aggregate demands.

In contrast to the case of single-unit demand, no stable mechanism, not even the (student-proposing) deferred acceptance algorithm, achieves desirable properties: it is not strategy-proof and the resulting allocation is not even weakly efficient under submitted preferences. We characterize the priority structure of courses over students under which stability is consistent with strategy-proofness or efficiency. We show that stability is compatible with strategy-proofness or efficiency if and only if the priority structure is essentially homogeneous.

This has made the industry energy-intensive and consequently a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and other pollutants. This study has attempted to investigate the potential for inter-fuel substitution between coal, oil, natural gas and electricity in Chinese chemical sector by employing a translog production and cost function. Ridge regression procedure was adopted to estimate the parameters of the function. Estimation results show that all energy inputs are substitutes. In addition, the study produces evidence that the significant role of coal in the Chinese chemical fuel mix converges over time, albeit slowly. These results suggest that price-based policies, coupled with capital subsidy programs can be adopted to redirect technology use towards cleaner energy sources like electricity and natural gas; hence, retaining the ability to fuel the chemical sector, while also mitigating GHG emissions. Notwithstanding, one must understand that the extent to which substituting electricity for coal will be effective depends on the extent to which coal or oil is used in generating electricity. The findings of this study provide general insights and underscore the importance of Chinese government policies that focus on installed capacity of renewable electricity, energy intensity targets as well as merger of enterprises.

The results show that while short-run elasticities are similar to those in previous studies, long-run elasticities are significantly lower in our study. We also find that the price elasticity of Japanese residential electricity consumption is notably affected by income inequality and severe weather. Based on these results, we provide some insights to tailor environmental taxation so as to effectively attain the Kyoto Protocol. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As the most attractive, accessible deposits are mined out, future discoveries may prove to be significantly, perhaps unsustainably, more intensive consumers of environmental resources. A number of previous attempts have been made to provide empirical relationships connecting these environmental impact metrics to process variables such as stripping ratio and ore grade. These earlier attempts were often constrained by a lack of real world data and perform poorly when compared against data from modern operations. This paper conditions new empirical models of energy, water and land use in uranium mining, milling, and refining on contemporary data reported by operating mines. It shows that, at present, direct energy use from uranium production represents less than 1% of the electrical energy produced by the once-through fuel cycle. Projections of future energy intensity from uranium production are also possible by coupling the empirical models with estimates of uranium crustal abundance, characteristics of new discoveries, and demand. The projections show that even for the most pessimistic of scenarios considered, by 2100, the direct energy use from uranium production represents less than 3% of the electrical energy produced by the contemporary once-through fuel cycle.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; NONRADIAL MODELS; DAMAGES; SCALE,"This study compares among fossil fuel power plants in PJM and California ISO by their unified (operational and environmental) performance. DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) is used as a methodology. For comparative analysis, DEA incorporates strategic concepts such as natural and managerial disposability into the computational process. This study explores both how to measure Returns to Scale (RTS) under natural disposability and how to measure Damages to Scale (DTS) under managerial disposability. This empirical study obtains two implications on US energy policy. One of the two policy implications is that California ISO outperforms PJM in terms of the three unified efficiency measures. The result implies that strict regulation on undesirable outputs, as found in California, is important in enhancing the performance of US fossil fuel power plants. Thus, it is necessary for federal and local governments to regulate the fossil fuel power plants under the strict implementation of environmental protection. Under such a policy direction, it is possible for US fossil fuel power plants to attain economic prosperity (by enhancing their operational efficiencies) and to satisfy environmental regulation (by enhancing their environmental efficiencies). The other policy implication is that coal-fired and gas-fired power plants in PJM and California ISO need to reduce their operational sizes or introduce technology innovation on desirable and undesirable outputs and/or new management for environmental protection within their operations. Meanwhile, oil-fired power plants may increase their operational sizes if they can introduce technology innovation and new management on undesirable outputs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

More precisely, we investigate to what extent oil prices impact the real effective exchange rate in an Eastern European transition country, characterised by a low level of retail fuel prices and by an important growth rate of these prices as compared to the other EU countries. For this purpose we use a discrete wavelet transform approach and scale-by-scale Granger causality tests. We find that oil prices have a strong influence on the real effective exchange rate in the short run, but also for large time horizons. These results are important considering the fact that, in a classical Granger causality linear framework for the entire sample, we find that oil prices have no influence on the real effective exchange rate. The findings remain robust when resampling the initial 1986-2009 period, or when we use an alternative continuous wavelet transform. In addition, we discover that mainly the positive shocks associated with an increase in oil prices have an impact upon the real effective exchange rate movements in the short and long runs.

A Northern final-good producer needs to buy an intermediate input from a supplier to complete production. She can find this supplier either in the low-wage but financially underdeveloped South or in the high-wage and financially developed North. I show that financial institution differences affect the optimal contract offered to the supplier and are enough to generate a product cycle. The final-good producer faces a trade-off between low wages and contracting distortions. When the good is new, she finds it optimal to keep production in the North, at the cost of a higher wage but with the benefit of a less distorted contract. However, as the good becomes more standardized, the importance of the supplier increases and the cost of not shifting production to the South and take advantage of the lower wage offsets the contractual distortions that the underdeveloped Southern financial institutions create. The most salient empirical prediction is that the more R&D-intensive an industry is, the larger is the effect of financial development on offshoring. These results also hold when wages are endogenized. In the empirical section, the prediction is tested and confirmed using disaggregated trade data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Failing adequate insurance arrangements, a long wave of such mortality can so undermine human capital formation as to induce an economic collapse. In nuclear family structures, random matching of partners is superior to assortative mating only if the shock is not too big and initial levels of human capital are not too low. Full pooling of mortality risks with equal treatment of all children in extended families may fend off a general collapse, depending on the initial conditions and the size and duration of the shock. To avoid undesirable effects on expectations, awareness campaigns should be complemented by policies that credibly promise to reduce future mortality. If mortality depends on the general level of human capital, indeterminacy can arise in the form of more than one rational expectations path. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we model the effect of mortality expectations and interdependent fertility preferences on fertility. The direct marginal effect of mortality expectations on fertility is larger than zero but less than unity. This implies that a decrease in mortality rates leads to a decrease in children born but to an increase in the number of surviving children and hence the rate of population growth. Taking into account interdependent fertility preferences, whereby an individual's fertility choice affects the fertility decisions of others, the marginal effect of mortality expectations on fertility becomes one. Hence, if we allow for both mortality expectations and the amplifying effect of interdependent fertility preferences, a decrease in child mortality has no net effect on the rate of population growth.

Identification is based on the introduction of the Cash-for-Care program in Norway in 1998, which increased mothers' incentives to withdraw from the labor market when their child was one and two years old. Our estimates demonstrate that, for mothers without a university degree or with pre-reform earnings below the median, the program had effects on earnings and full-time employment even when the child was no longer eligible for Cash-for-Care at ages four and five. However, from age six, we can no longer see any effects. Further analysis suggests that the effects dissipate because most mothers remained attached to the labor force through part-time employment.

We find that spending decentralization has tended to be associated with lower economic growth while revenue decentralization has been associated with higher growth. Since OECD countries are substantially more spending than revenue decentralized, this is consistent with Oates' (1972) hypothesis that maximum efficiency gains require a close match between spending and revenue decentralization. It suggests reducing expenditure decentralization, and simultaneously increasing the fraction financed locally, would be growth-enhancing.

We argue that in our sample of exactly matched injured and non-injured workers, these health shocks (predominantly impairments in the musculoskeletal system) are quasi-randomly assigned. A fixed-effects difference-in-differences approach estimates a negative and persistent effect on subsequent employment and earnings. After initial periods with a higher incidence of sick leave, injured workers are more likely to be unemployed, and a growing share of them leave the labor market via disability retirement. Injured workers who manage to stay in employment incur persistent earnings losses. The effects are somewhat stronger for sub-groups of workers who are typically less attached to the labor market.

A set of binary dictator games is implemented within a telephone survey conducted with a representative sample of adults. The results indicate that, overall, equity plays a more important role than efficiency for the decision to give. Relative to the general population, young individuals are less concerned with inequality, while individuals with higher education are more concerned with social welfare.

Efficiency in this context is defined as a firm's capacity to maximize output given a fixed level of inputs. The findings suggest that the average operation rate, customer density and size variables are associated with lower levels of inefficiency (or higher levels of efficiency), while water purification (a conditioning variable capturing low initial water quality), subsidies and outsourcing are associated with higher levels of inefficiency. Since inefficiency exists, there is an opportunity to improve Japanese water utilities by working on emulating best practice firms whenever possible and by providing a regulatory framework that can set appropriate incentive schemes to do so.","Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Rolla, MO 65409 USA",University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology,"Phillips, MA (通讯作者)，Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, 101 Harris Hall,301 W 14th St, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.",michellephillips@ufl.edu,,"Phillips, Michelle/0000-0003-0894-3516",,,,,38,10,10,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

While that may have been a valid description of the data before the First World War, it is now inaccurate. Since the Second World War, protectionism has not been counter-cyclic; tariffs and non-tariff barriers simply do not rise systematically during downturns. I document this new stylised fact with a panel of data covering over 180 countries and 40years, using over a dozen measures of protectionism and six of business cycles. I test and reject a number of potential reasons why protectionism is no longer counter-cyclic. A diagnosis of exclusion' leads me to believe that modern economics may well be responsible for the decline in protectionism's cyclic behaviour; economists are more united in their disdain for protectionism than virtually any other concept. This in turn leaves one optimistic that the level of protectionism will continue to decline along with its cyclicality. Andrew K.

We suggest that people ask for compensation when increasing work hours but also when reducing work hours even when continuing to work part-time. Based on survey results, we show that the reference point (the worker's actual position) is important, and has an effect on the requested compensation when increasing or decreasing the number of hours worked. We find that the requested compensation is neither linear and nor symmetrical, and suggest that welfare policy should take the immaterial sustenance into account. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The paper, theoretically and empirically, evaluates the labor supply effects of cuts in statutory sick pay levels on long-term absenteeism in Germany. Cutting sick pay did not significantly reduce the average incidence and duration of sick leave periods longer than six weeks. A simple theoretical model confirms the empirical findings under the assumption that the long-term sick are seriously sick. Thus, moral hazard seems to be less of an issue in the upper tail of the sickness spell distribution. However, the results show heterogeneity in the effects and significant duration decreases for certain subsamples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, time series studies for specific countries may be more attractive and yield revealing results. For this reason, we study hereafter the long-run relationship between economic growth and income inequality in the case of Mexico. To this end, a time series of data for the Gini coefficients from Solt (2011) is used over the period 1968-2010, within a cointegration exercise. Being related to a single country, our results are suffering less from problems of heterogeneity, endogeneity, and measurement errors, which are commonly encountered in cross-country growth regressions. We first investigate (and confirm) that the two series of per capita GDP and Gini index are cointegrated. Five different methodologies are implemented in our analysis, so that the robustness of cointegration results is guaranteed. We consistently also find that the relationship between those variables is negative. Moreover, results show the per capita GDP to be weakly exogenous. According to tests for Granger causality, unidirectional causality runs from per capita GDP to the Gini index. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the nest leaving age has declined from one cohort to the next and that the tendency has been of a relative decline in leaving one's parents to start a family and an increase in leaving home to pursue higher education, even if the first pattern was still the most common for the baby-boomers. We test an altruistic model where constrained parents push the child out, where less constrained proximity altruistic parents can help the child by providing a home or even, for the richest active altruists, help the child leave the nest. Taking into account the endogenous child's choices of education, we find that most parents helped by being proximity altruists, while some helped their children move out and that the quality of the home had an important influence on the nest leaving age.","[Angelini, Viola] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Angelini, Viola] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Laferrere, Anne] INSEE, Paris, France; [Laferrere, Anne] CREST, Paris, France",University of Groningen; Tilburg University,"Laferrère, A (通讯作者)，INSEE, Paris, France.",v.angelini@rug.nl; anne.laferrere@insee.fr,"Angelini, Viola/AAF-6679-2021","Angelini, Viola/0000-0002-5177-3447",,,,,41,10,10,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.
