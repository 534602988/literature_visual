In the first part, the paper analyzes requirements for determination of reasonable profit in current time. The paper analyzes actual determination of reasonable profit, too. Reasonable profit is often specified as percentage part of the costs. In the second part, there is an analysis of risks which affect reasonable profit. These risks are divided into two basic groups: cost risk and income risk. The paper describes ways of dividing risks between contractual sides. In the last part, the relationship which expresses the functionality between reasonable profit and risk in public passenger transport is discussed.","Zilinska Univ Ziline, Fak Prevadzky & Ekonomiky Dopravy & Spojov, Katedra Cestnej & Mestskej Dopravy, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Poliak, M (通讯作者)，Zilinska Univ Ziline, Fak Prevadzky & Ekonomiky Dopravy & Spojov, Katedra Cestnej & Mestskej Dopravy, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",Milos.Poliak@fpedas.utc.sk,"Poliak, Milos/R-5949-2016","Poliak, Milos/0000-0002-9149-2439",,,,,21,18,18,0,13,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

One of the key issues is the degree to which consumption is sensitive to actual temporary changes in current income. Modern intertemporal approach builds on permanent income hypothesis, which concludes that the sensitivity of consumption (and savings) to temporary changes in income is low. The paper formulates a simple intertemporal model of current account and employs the present value test of the model in the cases of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. It further focuses on the role of habits in modeling current accounts. The results show that a simple intertemporal model has some descriptive power, especially in the case of the Czech Republic, but overall it gives rather poor results. It is the assumption that the economy consists strictly of ricardian agents that seems to be the main reason behind the empirical failure.","Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Posta, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vit.posta@vse.cz,,"Posta, Vit/0000-0001-9919-4519",,,,,25,1,1,0,6,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

J,"Soltes, V; Rusnakova, M",,,,"Soltes, Vincent; Rusnakova, Martina",,,Hedging Against a Price Drop Using the Inverse Vertical Ratio Put Spread Strategy Formed by Barrier Options,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,hedging; Inverse Vertical Ratio Put Spread strategy; barrier options; vanilla option; SPDR Gold Shares,FIRMS,"This paper investigates hedging of a portfolio consisting of a risky underlying asset using the Inverse Vertical Ratio Put Spread (further IVRPS) strategy formed by single barrier options (category exotic options; subcategory path-dependent options) to study the difference between hedging using barrier and vanilla options. This strategy is useful for hedging against a price drop assuming the given underlying asset will be sold in the future. Barrier options were created to provide risk managers with cheaper means to hedge their exposures without paying for the price changes they believed unlikely to occur. They are options with second strike price, called barrier or trigger. Crossing of the barrier (in the form of frontier underlying asset price) during the life of an option implies activation or deactivation of particular barrier option. In general, they are more flexible and cheaper in comparison to plain vanilla options. In our analysis we use an interesting approach based on finding of the income functions from secured position in analytical form, which can simplify hedging process. These theoretical results are robust to different underlying assets and are useful for financial and also non-financial institutions. Many authors use this approach of analyzing for example Amaitiek, Balint and Resovsky (2010), Soltes M (2010), Soltes V. (2001), Soltes V. and Amaitiek (2010a), Soltes V. and Amaitiek (2010b). A key difference between the previous studies is that in this paper we are concentrated on barrier options. Furthermore, we focus on the application to SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). SPDR Gold Shares offer investors an innovative, relatively cost efficient and secure way to access the gold market without being necessary to take care of delivery and safekeeping. GLD are an appropriate tool for those who want to play in the gold market, not for those who want to buy real gold It is possible to use them for hedging, forming of option strategies etc. For these reasons they are very popular and SPDR Gold Trust is currently one of the largest holder of the gold in the world. We use vanilla and barrier option on these shares in our analysis. Due to the lack of real-traded barrier option data we calculate the barrier option premiums using an analytical model of Haug, who applied the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for all kinds of barrier options. We realize all calculations in the statistical program R because of simplification. The comparative comparison of proposed variants has shown the best results. We also find the best variants for the investor who speculates, and at the same time hedges against a slight or significant price drop. Our study confirms that this strategy formation using barrier options gives end-users greater flexibility to express a precise view. The results show that IVRPS strategy formation using barrier options is better than this option strategy formation using vanilla option in specific future price situations, but not in every practical situation.","[Soltes, Vincent; Rusnakova, Martina] Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Soltes, V (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",vincent.soltes@tuke.sk; martina.rusnakova@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Vincent/AAA-2329-2020; Bobriková, Martina/AAA-7080-2020","Bobriková, Martina/0000-0002-3116-5786",,,,,35,29,29,0,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This study proposes that the likelihood of individual participation in corporate entrepreneurship initiatives is contingent upon individual perceptions of rewards and risks. The research presents different scenarios, and tests several attributes that influence the decision to participate. Conjoint analysis utilisation simulates a real life situation where scenario analyses in varying combinations in terms of their intensity levels take place. The results indicate the most important attribute influencing the decision to participate is the probability of venture success followed closely by financial reward. As expected, job risk, pay risk and required effort are deterrents to participation; and individuals with past entrepreneurial experience are less concerned about job risk and have a higher positive perception regarding the probability of corporate venture success.","[Urban, Boris; Nikolov, Kristo] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Business, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Business, 2 Davids St Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Boris.Urban@wits.ac.za,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,91,10,14,2,56,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

ASETS trading platform is a distributed SOA implementation, with its own API based on JMS. In order to design and implement an Android based client able to intercommunicate with the server side components of ASETS, there was particularly necessary to have object imbedded messages, produced by various services of ASETS, pushed to the client application in a manner consistent with publisher/subscriber JMS communication model. While point-to-point communication model could be resolved on the client side by employing synchronous HTTP socket connections over TCP/IP, the asynchronously generated messages from the server side had to reach the client application in a push manner.","[Vinte, Claudiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,claudiu.vinte@ie.ase.ro,"Vinte, Claudiu/AAG-4708-2020","Vinte, Claudiu/0000-0002-4460-1524",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2013,,,,,,,20,25,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGV43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324282200005,0

It shows that the contradictory findings of existing published literature can be explained by introducing a migration distance variable. The empirical studies show that land holding plays a different role in short-distance and long-distance migration. Land holding has a U-shaped curve association with the probability of short-distance migration and has an inverted-U-shaped association with the probability of long-distance migration. Therefore, the government needs to provide more job information and migration subsidies to farmers who have little land to overcome difficulties in the process of migration so as to reduce ruralurban inequality.","Hokkaido Univ, Dept Econ, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Dept Econ, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",wangxuelong@ec.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,,18,5,7,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2013,21.0,1,,,,,107,126,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12011.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,073MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313747300006,0

Using data on both revealed and stated preference game-trip behavior from a telephone survey conducted throughout Alberta, we estimate the effect of ticket prices, team quality, arena amenities, and capacity on the latent demand for National Hockey League hockey games. We find that lower ticket prices, higher team quality, and additional capacity encourage attendance. In the status quo scenario, consumer surplus per game is $50 for those who had attended hockey games and about 50% less for those who had not attended games. Exploiting the stated preference data, we develop a number of other consumer surplus estimates. We also include travel costs in the estimation of the demand function and estimate the full value of the game trip considering both ticket prices and travel costs. Sold-out arenas in Calgary and Edmonton generate annual consumption benefits of $40 and $35 million when only ticket prices are used to calculate consumer surplus (i.e., excluding travel costs). Considering the full-price consumer surplus for the Calgary Flames of $103 per game trip, the annual consumption benefits may be as high as $82 million.

Global GHG emissions in 2050 are required to be reduced by 72% relative to a reference scenario, which corresponds to a 57% reduction from the 2005 level, in order to meet the above target. Energy intensity improvement contributes a lot to curbing CO2 emission in the short-term. Meanwhile, carbon intensity reduction and CO2 capture play a large role for further emission reduction in the mid to long-term. The top five key technologies in terms of reduction amount are CCS, solar power generation, wind power generation, biomass power generation and biofuel, which, in total, account for about 60% of global GHG emissions reduction in 2050. We implement additional model runs, each of which enforced limited availability of one of the key technology. The result shows that the 2.6 W/m(2) target up to 2050 is achievable even if availability of any one of the key technologies is limited to half the level achieved in the default simulation. However, if the use of CCS or biomass is limited, the cumulative GHG abatement cost until 2050 increases considerably. Therefore CCS and biomass have a vital role in curbing costs to achieve significant emission reductions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We then find that the out-of-sample prediction errors provided by the accrual-based earnings model are significantly lower than those obtained with the cash flows model.

Borrowing to finance educational expenditures has been increasing-more than quadrupling in real dollars since the early 1990s. The sheer magnitude of these figures has led to increased public commentary on the level of student borrowing. We move the discussion of student loans away from anecdote by establishing a framework for considering the use of student loans in the optimal financing of collegiate investments. From a financial perspective, enrolling in college is equivalent to signing up for a lottery with large expected gains-indeed, the figures presented here suggest that college is, on average, a better investment today than it was a generation ago-but it is also a lottery with significant probabilities of both larger positive, and smaller or even negative, returns.

It subjects to critical appraisal Malthus's enthusiasm for private property and the market system, and his opposition to market regulation.

However, all such effects were also influenced by the roughly simultaneous introduction of similar easing in the USA, which complicates the analysis. Another area where QE has been positive is in reducing public-sector borrowing costs. Where QE1 (and subsequent rounds) have disappointed is in their inability to stimulate a recovery in credit and monetary growth, amid an increased desire among banks to hold far more of their reserves at the central bank. Moreover, there is growing evidence of significant diminishing returns in QE2 as gilt rates have already fallen to historically low levels and the risk is that, if policy-makers fail to resuscitate the bank lending channel, further rounds of QE could potentially have negative returns.","[Goodhart, Charles A.

The central bank also imposes an indicative target, which may not be binding at all times, for total credit in the banking system. We develop and calibrate a theoretical model to illustrate the conduct of monetary policy within the framework of dual-track interest rates and a juxtaposition of price- and quantity-based policy instruments. We show the transmission of monetary policy instruments to market interest rates, which, together with the indicative credit target in the banking system, ultimately are the means by which monetary policy affects the real economy. The model shows that market interest rates are most sensitive to changes in the benchmark deposit interest rates, significantly responsive to changes in the reserve requirements, but not particularly reactive to open market operations. These theoretical results are verified and supported by both linear and GARCH models using daily money and bond market data. Overall, the findings of this study help us to understand why the central bank conducts monetary policy in China the way it does, using a combination of price and quantitative instruments with differing degrees of potency in terms of their influence on the cost of credit.

This time-varying approach outperforms other methods used in the relevant literature for an economy in transition, such as China, that has undergone a significant transformation over the period under consideration. Our results indicate that Chinese regions have converged into clubs. However, it is observed that Heilongjiang is diverging in terms of labor productivity and capital intensity, while Liaoning and Guizhou display similar patterns in terms of labor productivity, and Shanxi and Hebei in terms of capital intensity.

In this paper we re-investigate the long- and short-run comovements in the G7-countries by conducting tests for cointegration, common serial correlation and codependence with nominal and real interest rates, using quarterly data from 1975 to 2010. Overall, we find only little evidence of comovements. Common trends are occasionally observed, but the majority of interest rates are not cointegrated. Although some evidence for codependence of higher order is found in the pre-Euro area sample, common cycles appear to exist only in rare cases. We argue that some earlier, more positive findings are difficult to reconcile due to differing assumptions about the underlying stochastic properties of interest rates. We conclude that they cannot be generalized for all interest rates, time periods, and reasonable alternative estimation procedures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Nuclear energy and Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) are regarded as important mitigation options. However, harsh criticisms have been directed at Japanese nuclear energy policy after the Fukushima nuclear accident, and the Japanese government will be required to re-evaluate not only its energy policy, but also the GHG reduction target itself. Like nuclear energy, CCS might not be regarded as a suitable option for GHG mitigation because its long-term safety has not been revealed. In this paper we analyze the energy policy response to an absence of nuclear energy and CCS, especially focusing on Japan, China and India. We find that the appropriate energy strategies against the unproven technologies differ between regions due to the uneven pre-existing nuclear energy, CCS potential and renewable energy potential, and the resource endowments and the levels of economic development. We also find that the strict mitigation target can be achieved even if nuclear energy and CCS are not available. In such a case, however, significant enhancement of renewable energy is needed, as well as particular fossil fuel alternatives based on region-specific availabilities and costs.

Using GCAM, an integrated assessment model, this paper analyzes a targets approach for pushing solar, wind, and nuclear technologies in the Indian electricity generation sector from 2005 to 2095. Targets for these technologies have been constructed on the basis of Indian government documents, policy announcements, and expert opinions. Different targets have been set for the reference scenario and the carbon price scenario. In the reference scenario, wind and nuclear technologies exceed respective targets in the long run without any subsidy push, while solar energy requires subsidy push throughout the century in order to meet its high targets. In the short run, nuclear energy also requires significant subsidy, including a much higher initial subsidy relative to solar power, which is a result of its higher targets. Under a carbon price scenario, the carbon price drives the penetration of these technologies. Still, subsidy is required - especially in the short run when the carbon price is low. We also found that pushing solar, wind, and nuclear technologies leads to a decrease in share of CCS under the carbon price scenario and biomass under both the reference and carbon price scenarios. This is because low carbon technologies compete among themselves and substitute each other, thereby enhancing the need for subsidy or carbon price, highlighting that proposed targets are not set at efficient levels. In light of contemporary debate on external costs of nuclear energy, we also assess the sensitivity of the results to nuclear technology cost. We find that higher cost significantly decreases the share of nuclear power under both the reference and carbon price scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Most factor share studies, however, acknowledge only two factors of production (total capital and total labor), which yields misleading results. I distinguish between reproducible and non-reproducible factors of production. I disentangle physical capital's share from natural capital's share and human capital's share from unskilled labor's share. Results reveal that non-reproducible factor shares decrease with the stage of economic development, and reproducible factor shares increase with the stage of economic development. This evidence suggests that studies relying on the macroeconomic paradigm of constant factor shares should be revisited. The evidence also supports endogenous growth models that allow technical progress to manifest itself via changes in factor shares. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This is achieved by defining advice in terms of the forecasts of future repayments in order to produce a disutility-minimising loan strategy. The economic value of this strategy is then calculated by considering the fee one is willing to pay to avoid switching to a competing strategy during each period. Applying the methodology to UK fixed and variable mortgage rates produces performance fees that are high when advice takes account of the dynamics of repayments. Moreover, the conditions under which these fees are significantly different from zero are identified. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We predict the absence of a full crowding-out of private R&D performance, both for the whole sample and for some subsets of firms. Nevertheless, we conclude that while for variables expressed as ratio (R&D intensity and R&D per employee) the difference in results is negligible, R&D expenditure presents a strong variability among the approaches, even for those relying on similar identification assumptions.

In this paper we consider the possibility that a linear cointegrated regression model with multiple structural changes would provide a better empirical description of the Spanish EKC during the period 1857-2007. Our methodology is based on instability tests recently proposed in Kejriwal and Perron (2008, 2010) as well as on cointegration tests developed in Arai and Kurozumi (2007) and Kejriwal (2008). Overall, the results of Kejriwal-Perron tests suggest a model with two breaks estimated at 1941 and 1967 and three regimes. The coefficient estimated between per-capita CO2 and per-capita income (or long-run elasticity) in a two-break model shows a tendency to decrease over time. Therefore, even if per-capita CO2 consumption is monotonically rising in income, the income elasticity is less than one. This implies that even if the shape of the EKC does not follow an inverted U, it shows a decreasing growth path pointing to a prospective turning point. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that there are effective output spillovers from Guangdong, Liaoning and Zhejiang to other provinces in China, but trivial effects from Shanghai, Shandong, Sichuan and Xinjiang, and negative effects from Beijing. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Guangdong and Liaoning is the main channel for creating provincial output spillovers, compared with domestic investment and exports. However, FDI spillovers tend to decrease, with spillovers from exports and domestic investment rising over time, so that the spillover effects in Guangdong and Liaoning are non-persistent and highly volatile. Other channels of output spillover, such as domestic investment, should be enhanced. Impacts of shock from government expenditure on GDP vary significantly across time and provinces; inland and western provinces are most negatively affected. The heterogeneous spillover structure shows that regional policies might achieve better results than nationwide policies in reducing regional disparity.","[Peng, Hui] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Kim, Bonghan] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Int Econ, Kong Ju 314701, South Korea",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Kongju National University,"Peng, H (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.",gracepenghui@126.com; bonghankim@126.com,,,,,,,39,3,4,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2012,20.0,6,,,,,55,81,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.12002.x,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,051RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312146300003,0

Whilst full discussion of Sraffa's early scientific and intellectual development would fall outside the scope of this paper, the treatment directs the reader's attention to some elements of potential interest, and it supports the interpretation advanced by Pasinetti.

The key mechanism in the model is that the home firm's incentive to keep its domestic price close to the optimal monopoly price affects its behavior during price competition abroad.

Firstly, the paper analyzes the risk-return tradeoff of the FSU compared with the Middle East. Secondly, the country portfolio perspective is used from a macro risk perspective, and then an extension of the Value-at-Risk model which is incorporated time-varying conditional volatility mode is adopted to describe the dynamic risk of country portfolio.

Risk-averse preferences are characterized by an option-based utility function that includes disutility from the dislike of bank equity risk. Regret-averse preferences feature an option-based utility function that includes disutility from having chosen ex-post suboptimal alternatives. We show that an increase in bank capital requirement results in an increased margin under risk aversion dominating regret aversion, whereas it results in a reduced margin under regret aversion dominating risk aversion. The former holds when risk aversion domination stems from increasing risk-averse preference, but not from decreasing regret-averse preference, while the latter holds when regret aversion domination results from either decreasing risk-averse or increasing regret-averse preference. Risk aversion, as such, makes the bank more prudent and less prone to risk-taking, while regret aversion, as such, makes the bank less prudent and more prone to risk-taking. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It terminates the dual corporate income tax regime by removing the preferential tax treatments offered to foreign investment enterprises (FIEs) and unifies the corporate income tax regime for FIEs and Chinese domestic enterprises (DEs). This paper uses a difference-in-differences approach to determine whether FIEs are responding to the law by reducing their investment in China. Employing the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database (2002 similar to 2008) to implement the analysis, we find that: (1) FIEs are responding to the law by reducing their investment in China; and (2) the magnitude of the response is larger for HongKong-Macau-Taiwan (HMT) investment enterprises than that for other FIEs, which supports the claim that some Chinese investors engaged in roundtripping FDI. Our confidence in the conclusions are further boosted by the results of a series of placebo tests and two robustness checks: (1) the results of the placebo tests support the claim that the estimated effect is due to the tax reform rather than to other confounding factors; (2) the results of the first robustness check are consistent with the perception that State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) might enjoy more favorable treatments from the Chinese government than Private-Owned Enterprises (POEs); and (3) the results of the second robustness check show that incorporating enterprise-specific time trends into the baseline specification of our econometric models does not change the conclusions.","Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Publ Adm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"An, ZY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Publ Adm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",anzy2008@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,15,18,2,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

However, if presales services stimulate demand by providing information about a product's value, they need not raise postsale value in use. Inframarginal consumers' presales perceived value may increase, but their postsale value may be unchanged, so their supposed CS gains are ephemeral, and their actual surplus falls proportional to price increase. We show that, even adding in gains to marginal consumers, effects on CS are far more negative than conceived of in this literature. Consequently, in a rule-of-reason antitrust environment, if RPM is challenged without alleging collusion or exclusion, presales demand-inducing information provision is a flimsy defense if CS is the standard and not always convincing if total surplus is the standard.","[Masson, Robert T.] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [da Graca, Tarcisio B.] Univ Ottawa, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0C9, Canada; [da Graca, Tarcisio B.] Canadian Competit Bur, Competit Bur, Econ Policy & Enforcement Branch, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0C9, Canada",Cornell University; University of Ottawa,"Masson, RT (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, 440 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tdagraca@uottawa.ca; rtm2@cornell.edu,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

However, theater owners claimed that blind bidding and guarantees shifted risk to them and increased the likelihood of bankruptcy, because they were required to bid for the right to exhibit a movie without seeing it first. In response to the lobbying of theater owners, 24 states passed laws between 1978 and 1984 that banned blind bidding, while 7 states also banned nonrefundable guarantees. This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the conflicting claims made by theater owners and movie studios about the impact of these laws on the survival rates of independent theaters, admission prices, and delays in the release of movies. We find that the laws were not only ineffective in keeping theater owners at risk of bankruptcy from exiting the market; they may have been even detrimental to those theater owners converting theaters to multiplexes at that time.

A simple neoclassical growth model with different tiers of government is developed. The initial focus is on governments that aim to maximise their citizens' welfare and economic performance by providing consumption goods for private consumption and public capital for private production. It is shown that a long-run per capita output maximising tax rate can be derived and that there also exists an optimal degree of fiscal decentralisation. The analysis then extends to the case where governments attempt instead to maximise their own tax revenue to fund expenditures which do not contribute to the utility of their citizens. Three different cases of taxation arrangement are considered: tax competition, tax sharing, and tax coordination. The modeling shows that intensifying tax competition will lead to an increase in the aggregate tax rate as compared to the cases of sharing and coordination amongst governments. These tax rates are both higher than the long-run per capita output maximising rate that was implied under the welfare maximising government scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we focus on a model, in which two subjects are supposed to make a binary decision. One alternative is a safe action with a fixed payoff, while the other alternative is a risky action. The subjects can make their decisions in three stages. The safe action is reversible, but the risky action is not. A subject who delays his decision can observe the decision of the other subject in the earlier stages, and as a result, acquire more information. We show that players do delay their decisions in order to obtain more information. Furthermore, they delay especially when their private information does not particularly support the risky action. We also find evidence which suggests that risk aversion plays an important role in timing decisions, often leading to ex post inefficient outcomes.","[Celen, Bogachan] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hyndman, Kyle] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Columbia University; Maastricht University,"Çelen, B (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, 3022 Broadway,602 Uris Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",bc2132@columbia.edu; k.hyndman@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Hyndman, Kyle/0000-0003-3666-8734; Celen, Bogachan/0000-0002-1698-3983",,,,,12,3,3,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

Researchers and development practitioners agree on its innovativeness and potential for transferability, since each member state enjoys a degree of freedom in applying it. Not only may each EU country arrange the program's objectives in line with its own priorities, it also has wide room for using the financial means granted to it and determining how to implement the program. This article focuses on the conditions for transferring the Leader approach (2007-2013) to all 27 EU member states. How have the latter interpreted and transposed this European model?

It affected the quality of highways available to firms in cities that lay along the routes of the four upgraded highways, while leaving the quality of highways available to firms in other cities unaffected. This feature of the project allows for a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, where status on and off the improved highways, and distance from them, are used as treatment variables. This strategy is implemented using data from the 2002 and 2005 rounds of the World Bank Enterprise Surveys for India. Firms in cities affected by the Golden Quadrilateral highway project reduced their average stock of input inventories by between 6 and 12 days' worth of production. Firms in cities where road quality did not improve showed no significant changes. The reduction in stocks of input inventories also varied inversely with the distance between the city in which a firm was located and the nearest city on an improved highway. Firms on the Golden Quadrilateral were also more likely to have switched the supplier who provided them with their primary input, suggesting that they saw reason to re-optimize their choice of supplier after the arrival of better highways. Consistent with these findings, firms on the improved highways reported decreased transportation obstacles to production, while firms in control cities reported no such change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We derive and estimate a fiscal policy equation that links government spending not only to oil price shocks, but also to oil price volatility and the skewness of oil price changes. We find that in the long run, higher oil prices induce larger government size. In the short run, however, government expenditures rise less than proportionately to the increase in oil revenues, reflecting increasing prudence in fiscal policy in oil producing countries.

Moreover, when the constraints cease to be binding, the growth rate is constant. We also show that a relaxation of the constraints cannot be Pareto improving even if the growth rate rises.

When voters have UCR preferences, candidates' equilibrium policies converge in any strict equilibrium. In contrast, notions like competence or complementarity lead to non-UCR preferences and policy divergence.

More recently, empirical approaches by economic historians (Abramovitz, Landes, Madison, Reinert) have found that while some countries are catching up, others are falling increasingly behind. Several theories compete to explain the precise mechanisms that explain how technological diffusion takes place. The paper reviews them and draws testable hypotheses for the study of international biotechnology diffusion. Biotechnologies are one of the leading sets of technologies developed in the late 20th century. They encompass applications in agriculture, chemicals, environment and pharmaceuticals. The United States has led the way in both scientific and industrial development of biotechnologies and these have quickly spread to Canada, Japan and Western Europe. Are the main developing countries adopting biotechnology? A study of the adoption of human health biotechnology in eight developing countries in Asia (China, India, Korea, and Singapore) and Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico) was conducted, based on the analysis of in situ interviews, patents and scientific publication. The study shows a marked process of adoption and learning in science: each of the above-mentioned developing countries is increasing its share of world publication between 1996 and 2008. However, their share of biotechnology patents for the same period has barely increased. There are also regional differences in terms of sectoral concentration; Latin America, Argentina and Brazil are eager adopters of agricultural biotechnology and are moving up in the pharmaceutical records. Several Argentinean, Chinese, Indian, and South Korean pharmaceutical companies have been particularly active in the development of biogenerics.","[Niosi, Jorge] Univ Quebec, Dept Management & Technol, Canada Res Chair Management Technol, Montreal, PQ H2X 3J6, Canada; [Hanel, Petr] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Econ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R, Canada; [Reid, Susan] Bishops Univ, Williams Sch Business, Sherbrooke, PQ J1M 1Z7, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Sherbrooke; Bishops University,"Niosi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Management & Technol, Canada Res Chair Management Technol, 1290 St Denis,Local AB-2300, Montreal, PQ H2X 3J6, Canada.",niosi.jorge@uqam.ca; petr.hanel@usherbrooke.ca; sreid@ubishops.ca,"Reid, Susan/F-2702-2012","Reid, Susan/0000-0002-4196-4514; Niosi, Jorge/0000-0001-5195-6828",,,,,38,16,19,0,167,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

It is a cap and trade system that requires industries participating to the program to procure allowances to cover their emissions. Electricity Intensive Industries (EIIs) have complained that the system put their European plants at disadvantage compared to facilities located outside the EU. They have asked for actions to mitigate this effect; one of them is to have access to long term contracts with electricity suppliers, ideally with those operating carbon free plants. This paper presents and illustrates a method for assessing the impact of this measure on EIIs participating to the EU cap and trade system. We model a power market segmented in two consumer groups EIIs and the rest of the market (N-EIIs). These two groups are subject to different price regimes: EIIs purchase electricity from dedicated base-load power plants at average cost price, while N-EIIs are supplied at marginal cost. The French Exeltium and the Belgian Blue Sky consortia are existing examples of this market organization. The expanse of the territories that can be covered by these systems depends on the organization of transmission organization and on national energy position relative to carbon free generation. We examine two different types of long term average cost based contracts that differ by the organization of transmission and study their impact under different national energy policies. We formulate the problem of operations and investment in this market as a spatial equilibrium model where generators can invest in new capacity subject to different regional constraints. Transmission is organized according to a flow based approach as foreseen by Regulatory Authorities and Transmission System Operators in Europe. We also examine the impact of nuclear policies. CO2 emission allowances are auctioned and tradable. We describe the models and discuss their policy implications through a stylized case study of the Central Western European electricity market.

Separation is very often assumed implicitly in empirical studies of food demand. If there is such separation, then food sourced within the household should not have any influence upon the budget share of each food group. Using this insight, this paper first develops a procedure to test for the separation of household food production and consumption decisions. Furthermore, it incorporates the testing procedure into the Almost Ideal Demand Systems model and utilizes survey data from 2003 for Turkey for empirical testing. It concludes that the separation assumption is unwarranted for Turkey. Next, it investigates the extent of bias in elasticity estimates when the separation assumption is unwarranted. It concludes that ignoring the nonseparation of consumption and production decisions in rural areas leads to significant overestimation of food expenditure elasticity for dairy products and eggs and own-price elasticity for bread and cereals.","Mardin Artuklu Univ, Dept Econ, Mardin, Turkey",Mardin Artuklu University,"Tekgüç, H (通讯作者)，Mardin Artuklu Univ, Dept Econ, Yenisehir Yerleskesi,Diyarbakir Yolu, Mardin, Turkey.",htekguc@gmail.com,"Tekguc, Hasan/C-9910-2019","Tekguc, Hasan/0000-0002-3902-4486",,,,,25,11,11,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The asymptotic properties of these estimates are also provided. The numerical simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis and show that our method is effective.

The hypothesis, which was set up by examining empirical evidence, points to heterogeneity across the macroeconomic conditions prevailing in different clusters of EMU countries. Given the strengthened financial and real interconnections across the EMU countries, the capital flows triggered by widening distances between surplus and deficit trade balances, and also between sound and deteriorating public budgets, represent an important factor magnifying systemic risk and contagion. The econometric estimates we conducted concern two sub-periods, the two decades from the launch of the EMS in 1979 to 1999, and the first twelve years (1999-2010) of the monetary union. The findings sound as a confirmation that the strengthened financial and real interconnections across the EMU countries, instead of facilitating convergence among the Core and the Peripheral economies, have magnified and mutually reinforced imbalances. The divide between surplus and deficit countries - the backward EMU countries running larger current account deficits, and the more advanced countries accumulating larger current account surpluses - have brought about increasing capital outflows from the Periphery to pay for excess imports from the Core. Conversely, increasing capital flows were invested by the banks of the Core countries in the Periphery's public bonds. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this exercise, we examine the implications of yen carry trade for stock markets in a few selected target currency countries. Three alternative proxies for carry trade activity - a currency-specific profit measure, a currency-specific futures position variable, and the Deutsche Bank G10 Currency Futures Harvest Index are used. It is found that the three measures of carry trade display various degrees of influences on stock returns in Australia, Canada, Britain, Mexico, and New Zealand. The empirical carry trade effect is robust to the inclusion of three control variables; namely the US stock return, the VIX Index that represents market volatility, and commodity prices. Further, the estimation results suggest that the three measures of carry trade share some common information about stock returns in target currency countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the MSS model is extended by combining a panel threshold regression technique. This threshold stochastic frontier panel data model enables the analysis of regime-specific stochastic frontiers and complex time-varying patterns of technical efficiencies in a robust manner. Using a dataset of 44 countries over 19702007, income elasticities of labor and capital and time-varying common efficiencies are found to be substantially different under superior and inferior frontiers. Capital and labor inputs are more productive under superior frontier. More importantly, common efficiencies have steadily increased under superior frontier, but technical efficiency has monotonically decreased for low income countries, supporting the so-called club convergence hypothesis. Furthermore, the VAR-based impulse response analyses suggest that openness factors through FDI and trade help the countries to improve production technology and efficiency position relative to the frontier only after the country has reached a certain level of development.","[Mastromarco, Camilla] Univ Salento, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Serlenga, Laura] Univ Bari, Dept Econ, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Shin, Yongcheol] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Salento; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of York - UK,"Mastromarco, C (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",camilla.mastromarco@unisalento.it; laura.serlenga@dse.uniba.it; yongcheol.shin@york.ac.uk,"Mastromarco, Camilla/N-4749-2015","Mastromarco, Camilla/0000-0003-4094-6549; SERLENGA, LAURA/0000-0002-7987-4880",,,,,35,3,3,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Next, we analyze whether a social planner can prevent such shortcomings and show that a regulatory mechanism can be designed to achieve socially desirable outcomes. In contrast to the previous literature, our model does not necessarily produce monopoly as the optimal market structure. We show that if fixed costs associated with establishing charities are sufficiently low, then the optimal market structure is not a monopoly.

Macroeconomists in academia and policy institutions have been blamed for relying too much on a particular class of macroeconomic models. This paper proposes a comparative approach to macroeconomic policy analysis that is open to competing modeling paradigms. Macroeconomic model comparison projects have helped produce some very influential insights such as the Taylor rule. However, they have been infrequent and costly, because they require the input of many teams of researchers and multiple meetings to obtain a limited set of comparative findings. This paper provides a new approach that enables individual researchers to conduct model comparisons easily, frequently, at low cost and on a large scale. Using this approach a model archive is built that includes many well-known empirically estimated models that may be used for quantitative analysis of monetary and fiscal stabilization policies. A computational platform is created that allows straightforward comparisons of models' implications. Its application is illustrated by comparing different monetary and fiscal policies across selected models. Researchers can easily include new models in the database and compare the effects of novel extensions to established benchmarks thereby fostering a comparative instead of insular approach to model development.

The savings function may undergo jumps and non-monotonicities when the income or the interest rate reaches a threshold value. These anomalies may exist even for reasonable parameter values.

To this end, we first provide a detailed classification of the banking system structure through the use of a hierarchical clustering methodology. Relying on the estimation of panel VAR models and accounting for potential heterogeneity between countries, we then propose a measure of credit procyclicality based on the impulse-response function of credit to a shock in GDP. Our findings show that while credit significantly responds to shocks in GDP, the structure of the banking sector is not a key factor in assessing the procyclicality of credit for OECD countries.

Capital possesses a complex, multilevel (micro, meso, macro) structure that is always in the process of transformation. Levels of the capital structure are interdependent and interactive. Correspondingly, economic organisation at these various levels is not an independent entity in itself-it occurs as a by-product and structural aspect of capital formation. Rather than the transaction, our focal unit of analysis is a production notion: the capital combination that emanates from the kinetic organisation of material by human agency. We consider the behaviour of entrepreneurs as causal agents in specifying and appraising potential capital combinations, reorganising production and scrapping capital. Entrepreneurs' combinatorial actions often change existing materials to serve functions for which they were not originally designed, thereby changing capital structures and the shape and boundaries of economic organisation at different levels of economic complexity. Capital is created in a dynamic knowledge-generation process that depends on entrepreneurs' perceptions of gaps in the capital structure.","[Endres, Anthony M.] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Endres, Anthony M.; Harper, David A.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Auckland; New York University,"Endres, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Private Mail Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",a.endres@auckland.ac.nz,"Harper, David A/U-3706-2018","Harper, David A/0000-0002-4716-3638",,,,,62,10,10,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We compare the effects of these FTAs on China's output and welfare. Our comparative analysis shows that China will gain from all three bilateral FTAs, while gaining the most from the ASEAN+3. Because forming a region-wide FTA, such as the ASEAN+3, is expected to be gradual and difficult, China should continue to engage in bilateral FTAs as a medium-term and alternative strategy.

This study compares different cases of domestic and CPI inflation targeting, strict and flexible inflation targeting, and simple Taylor type rules. The analysis highlights the unsuitability of simple Taylor-type monetary rules in stabilizing the Indian economy and suggests that discretionary optimization works better in stabilizing this economy. There seems to be a trade-off between output gap stabilization and exchange rate stabilization in flexible domestic inflation targeting and CPI inflation targeting respectively. However, flexible domestic inflation targeting seems a better alternative from an overall macro stabilization perspective in India where financial markets are still not sufficiently integrated to ensure quick transmission of interest rate impulses and existence of rigidities in the economy.

J,"Mundell, R",,,,"Mundell, Robert",,,The case for a world currency,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,International monetary system; World currency; G-3 Monetary Union; DEY; INTOR,,"The flexible exchange rate experiment has been a failure. The best test of any monetary system is the degree to which it avoids unnecessary changes in real exchange rates. These changes drastically reduce the gains from trade and disqualify the arguments ordinarily made for free trade areas and the customs unions. By this criterion, the worst period in history has been the period since generalized floating that began in 1973. All of the arguments made for flexible exchange rates have proved to be incorrect. Destabilizing capital movements have rocked the exchange rates between areas that have a high and consistent degree of price stability. Exchange rates consistently overshoot equilibrium, causing harmful shifts between traded and non-traded goods industries and in the levels of indebtedness of rich and poor countries. The dollar-euro exchange rate, first dropping by a large percentage and then rising by an even larger percentage over the past 20 years, between areas that have price stability, is sufficient proof that the markets are not working in a direction and degree that is conducive to economic welfare. The solution lies in creating an international currency that can be used by all countries for international trade purposes. A two-step process is envisaged: First, a convergence of the three or four major currency areas on a common unit of account, called the DEY for dollar-euro yen or dollar-euro-yuan, with a joint Monetary Policy Council to determine monetary policy of the area. Countries could start with large margins and gradually reduce them to complete convergence. Second, the Board of Governors of the IMF (or its replacement) designate the DEY as the platform on which, in conjunction possibly with gold, it will build the new world currency, to be called the INTOR. Both the Keynes and White Plans called for a world currency. Political conditions were not ripe for its inclusion in the Articles of Agreement and that is one of the reasons why the great post-war monetary experiment of the fixed-exchange-rate international system broke down. Since the creation of the euro, the political configuration of the international monetary system has changed and the United States is no longer the unquestioned dictator. It is now very much in America's interest, as well as the interests of the EU, Japan and China, to restore a new international monetary system that would be to the economic benefit of all countries.

The market has three investment opportunities, namely, a bank account, a share and a zero-coupon bond, where stochastic movements of the short rate and the share price are governed by a Markovian regime-switching Vasicek model and a Markovian regime-switching Geometric Brownian motion, respectively. We discuss the optimal asset allocation problem using the dynamic programming approach for stochastic optimal control and derive a regime-switching Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Particular attention is paid to the exponential utility case. Numerical and sensitivity analysis are provided for this case. The numerical results reveal that regime-switches described by a two-state Markov chain have significant impacts on the optimal investment strategies in the share and the bond. Furthermore, the market prices of risk in both the bond and share markets are crucial factors in determining the optimal investment strategies. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A power mechanism is modeled by an interaction form, the solution of which is called a settlement. By stability, we mean the existence of some settlement for any preference profile. Configurations that produce instability are called cycles. We introduce a stability index that measures the difficulty of emergence of cycles. Structural properties such as exactness, superadditivity, subadditivity and maximality provide indications about the type of instability that may affect the mechanism. We apply our analysis to strategic game forms in the context of Nash-like solutions or core-like solutions.

First, I show environments in which, without early contributions, parties cannot be trusted to communicate sincerely, so that the joint endeavor always fails. Then, for the same environments, I demonstrate that early contributions can create the conditions for mutual trust, improve the outcome of subsequent communication, and eventually increase welfare.

However, regular series of strictly comparable data are only rarely available. Price deflators are also often missing or disputed. In response, poverty prediction methods that track consumption correlates as opposed to consumption itself have been developed. These methods typically assume that the estimated relation between consumption and its predictors is stable over time-assumptions that cannot usually be tested directly. This study analyzes the performance of poverty prediction models based on small area estimation (SAE) techniques. Predicted poverty estimates are compared with directly observed levels in two country settings where data comparability over time is not a problem. Prediction models that employ either non-staple food or non-food expenditures or a full set of assets as predictors are found to yield poverty estimates that match observed poverty well. This offers some support to the use of such methods to approximate the evolution of poverty. Two further country examples illustrate how an application of the method employing models based on household assets can help to adjudicate between alternative price deflators.","[Christiaensen, Luc; Lanjouw, Peter] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Luoto, Jill] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Stifel, David] Lafayette Coll, Easton, PA 18042 USA",The World Bank; RAND Corporation; Lafayette College,"Christiaensen, L (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",Luc@wider.unu.edu; planjouw@worldbank.org; jluoto@rand.org,,"Lanjouw, Peter/0000-0002-4150-7890",,,,,33,34,37,0,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This paper advances two arguments. First, it argues that the conventional view of Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) as a odirty' trade barrier should be turned on its head. Rather, the absence of a carbon price comprises an implicit subsidy to dirtier production in non-regulated markets. Second, BCAs could act as a game-changer when climate policy negotiations move at a glacial pace, if at all. Materially stronger progress could be achieved indirectly from the threat of unilateral trade policies. The paper shows how this could come about, using a simple political game theory model. The appropriate game form is one in which parties move unilaterally and sequentially, given the failure to agree on a common course of action, and are fully aware of the impacts of their actions. The paper shows that properly crafted BCAs could help reduce trade distortions, limit the competiveness effects, and help build a broader coalition of interests for more global actions.","[Helm, Dieter; Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron; Ruta, Giovanni] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk; c.j.hepburn@lse.ac.uk; g.ruta@lse.ac.uk,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,42,68,70,6,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We conduct a detailed analysis of how cycles affect outcomes differentially across persons of differing age, education, race, and gender, and we compare the cyclical sensitivity during the Great Recession to that in the early 1980s recession. We present raw tabulations and estimate a state panel data model that leverages variation across U.S. states in the timing and severity of business cycles. We find that the impacts of the Great Recession are not uniform across demographic groups and have been felt most strongly for men, black and Hispanic workers, youth, and low-education workers. These dramatic differences in the cyclicality across demographic groups are remarkably stable across three decades of time and throughout recessionary periods and expansionary periods. For the 2007 recession, these differences are largely explained by differences in exposure to cycles across industry-occupation employment.","[Hoynes, Hilary; Miller, Douglas L.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Schaller, Jessamyn] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Hoynes, Hilary; Miller, Douglas L.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Arizona; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hoynes, H (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",hwhoynes@ucdavis.edu; dlmiller@ucdavis.edu; jschaller@eller.arizona.edu,,,,,,,27,336,382,4,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Although self-governance is best for the population, it faces problems of long-term viability. Typically, in providing security, the equilibrium market structure involves competing lords, a condition that leads to a tragedy of coercion: all the savings from the provision of collective protection are dissipated and welfare can be as low as, or even lower than, in the absence of the state. Thus, we explain the tendency towards autocracy both in history, before the appearance of modern representative governance, and in many low-income countries in modern times.","[Skaperdas, Stergios] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Konrad, Kai A.] Max Planck Inst Intellectual Property Competit &, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Max Planck Society,"Skaperdas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kai.konrad@ip.mpg.de; sskaperd@uci.edu,,,,,,,36,39,49,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Using data from the China Urban Labour Survey, it uses standard wage decomposition techniques to measure the extent wage gaps between migrants and locals are attributable to migration. Because the survey covers five cities, the results allow for an investigation regarding how much variation in discrimination there is. Unlike previous studies of wage discrimination in China, this research includes a more full measure of remuneration by including non-financial benefits as well as bonuses earned. The results suggest that migrants still face a significant amount of discrimination, but that this varies a lot between cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Meyer, BD; Sullivan, JX",,,,"Meyer, Bruce D.; Sullivan, James X.",,,"Identifying the Disadvantaged: Official Poverty, Consumption Poverty, and the New Supplemental Poverty Measure",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNITED-STATES; INCOME,"We discuss poverty measurement, focusing on two alternatives to the current official measure: consumption poverty, and the Census Bureau's new Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) that was released for the first time last year. The SPM has advantages over the official poverty measure, including a more defensible adjustment for family size and composition, an expanded definition of the family unit that includes cohabitors, and a definition of income that is conceptually closer to resources available for consumption. The SPM's definition of income, though conceptually broader than pre-tax money income, is difficult to implement given available data and their accuracy. Furthermore, income data do not capture consumption out of savings and tangible assets such as houses and cars. A consumption-based measure has similar advantages but fewer disadvantages. We compare those added to and dropped from the poverty rolls by the alternative measures relative to the current official measure. We find that the SPM adds to poverty individuals who are more likely to be college graduates, own a home and a car, live in a larger housing unit, have air conditioning, health insurance, and substantial assets, and have other more favorable characteristics than those who are dropped from poverty. Meanwhile, we find that a consumption measure compared to the official measure or the SPM adds to the poverty rolls individuals who are more disadvantaged than those who are dropped. We decompose the differences between the SPM and official poverty and find that the most problematic aspect of the SPM is the subtraction of medical out-of-pocket expenses from SPM income. Also, because the SPM poverty thresholds change in an odd way over time, it will be hard to determine if changes in poverty are due to changes in income or changes in thresholds. Our results present strong evidence that a consumption-based poverty measure is preferable to both the official income-based poverty measure and to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for determining who are the most disadvantaged.","[Meyer, Bruce D.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meyer, Bruce D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sullivan, James X.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Notre Dame,"Meyer, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bdmeyer@uchicago.edu; sullivan.197@nd.edu,,,,,,,32,104,126,1,31,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Shill bidding is a strategy whereby a single decision-maker enters the auction under the guise of multiple identities (Yokoo et al. Games Econ Behav, 46 pp. 174-188, 2004). I formulate the problem of shill bidding for a bidder who knows the aggregate bid of her opponents. A key to the analysis is a subproblem-the -which searches for the cheapest way to win a given package using shills. An analysis of the CMP leads to several fundamental results about shill bidding: (i) I provide an exact characterization of the aggregate bids such that some bidder would have an incentive to shill bid against in terms of a new property ; (ii) the problem of optimally sponsoring shills is equivalent to the (for single minded bidders)-the problem of finding an efficient allocation in a combinatorial auction; (iii) shill bidding can occur in equilibrium; and (iv) the problem of shill bidding has an inverse, namely the collusive problem that a coalition of bidders may have an incentive to merge (even after competition among coalition members has been suppressed). I show that only when valuations are additive can the incentives to shill and merge simultaneously disappear.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Sher, I (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 4-101 Hanson Hall,1925 4th St S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",isher@umn.edu,,,,,,,40,5,5,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We analyze the effects of patent protection in the form of blocking patents. We show that patent protection changes the direction of innovation by having asymmetric effects on vertical innovation (i.e., quality improvement) and horizontal innovation (i.e., variety expansion). Calibrating the model and simulating transition dynamics, we find that strengthening the effect of blocking patents stifles vertical innovation and decreases economic growth but increases social welfare due to an increase in horizontal innovation. In light of this finding, we argue that in order to properly analyze the growth and welfare implications of patents, it is important to consider their often neglected compositional effects on vertical and horizontal innovation.

Specifically, we (1) show the significant variance in expectations about the economics of commercial-grade CCS hard coal power plants observed in the literature; (2) analyze the impact of CCS economics on electricity generation costs; and (3) investigate the expected deployment of CCS in the European power sector, depending on the variance of two main factors, efficiency and investment cost, using the bottom-up electricity sector model HECTOR. Simulation results show that investment costs strongly influence the market deployment of coal-fired CCS power plants, leading to a share of 16% in European generation capacity by 2025 with the lowest observed investment costs of 1400(sic)/kW. but only 2% with the highest of 3000(sic)/kW. A variation of conversion efficiency between 37% and 44%, the minimum and maximum observed values, only leads to a 13-15% share variation of CCS-equipped power plants. These findings are robust for the Base Case with a CO2 price of 43 (sic)/t and also for sensitivities with 30 and 20 (sic)/t CO2, but with a lower effect, as the overall share of CCS is significantly reduced at these prices.

This paper is aimed to provide a comprehensive review of China's experience in fiscal decentralization, explore the impact of fiscal decentralization on economic growth and public expenditures, and to identify political as well as economic issues arising after the 1994 tax sharing reform. As the government is shifting the development policy towards building a harmonious society, the current fiscal system requires immediate policy attention for its opaque and inappropriate expenditure assignment, particularly at the sub-provincial levels, the vertical fiscal gap and widening fiscal disparities, the complex and malfunctioning intergovernmental transfer system, the neglected sub-provincial fiscal arrangements, and the weakness in the vertical accountability of local governments to the Center as well as the horizontal accountability of local administrations to local needs and preferences.","[Shen, Chunli; Jin, Jing; Zou, Heng-fu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Wuhan Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Central University of Finance & Economics; Shenzhen University; Peking University; Wuhan University; The World Bank,"Shen, CL (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, CEMA, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shenchunli@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,115,127,4,65,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The transfer rules target regional differences in nominal GDP, consumption spending, labor income, and fiscal deficits. Targeting regional fiscal deficits is the only rule that reduces consumption fluctuations and that promotes interregional consumption risk sharing, but the overall welfare effect is negative. In contrast, targeting regional differences in labor income yields the largest welfare gains, but it also yields the largest fluctuations in consumption and real GDP. It is demonstrated that the welfare gains primarily stem from reducing the allocative inefficiency of input factors caused by nominal rigidities. The optimal transfer rule essentially implies a combination of consumption spending and labor income targeting, and it primarily targets the allocative inefficiency of factor inputs at the cost of lower interregional consumption risk sharing.

This is true equally of the determination of prices of imported goods, prices of local competitors' products, and the general CPI. But developing countries in the 1990s experienced a rapid downward trend in the degree of pass-through and speed of adjustment, more so than did high-income countries. As a consequence, slow and incomplete pass-through is no longer exclusively a luxury of industrial countries. Using a new data set-prices of eight narrowly defined brand commodities, observed in 76 countries-we find empirical support for some of the factors that have been hypothesized in the literature, but not for others. Significant determinants of the pass-through coefficient include per capita incomes, bilateral distance, tariffs, country size, wages, long-term inflation, and long-term exchange rate variability. Some of these factors changed during the 1990s. Part (and only part) of the downward trend in pass-through to imported goods prices, and in turn to competitors' prices and the CPI, can be explained by changes in the monetary environment-including a fall in long-term inflation. Real wages work to reduce pass-through to competitors' prices and the CPI, confirming the hypothesized role of distribution and retail costs in pricing to market. Rising distribution costs, due perhaps to the Balassa-Samuelson-Baumol effect, could contribute to the decline in the pass-through coefficient in some developing countries.","[Frankel, Jeffrey] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Parsley, David] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN USA; [Wei, Shang-Jin] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA",Harvard University; Vanderbilt University; Columbia University,"Frankel, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jeffrey_frankel@harvard.edu,,,,,,,48,57,68,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

In particular, they seem to be at variance with established psychological theories of information-seeking behavior. The present paper posits the decision about treating illness with medicine as the causal determinant for the expected net value of information, and attempts to explain idiosyncrasies in information-seeking behavior by using the notion of decision sensitivity to incoming information. Furthermore, active information avoidance is explained by modeling the expected emotional distress potentially brought about by bad news as a disutility factor in pay-off maximization. In this context two notions of uncertainty are distinguished: an epistemic uncertainty related to the prognostic probability assigned to the risk, and an emotional uncertainty related to the expected damage. Health-risk information can both reduce epistemic and increase emotional uncertainty, giving rise to idiosyncratic processing strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To do so, we analyze the cyclical properties of labor variables using an autoregressive vector to estimate the responses of the labor market to a terms of trade shock in Chile, for which two sources are defined: the mining industry and other sectors. We also develop a multiple sector model with search frictions that generates fluctuations in the rate of unemployment. Using a version of the model calibrated for Chile, we analyze its capacity to replicate the observed responses of the labor market to terms of trade fluctuations. We find that the model can qualitatively predict the effects of innovations in the terms of trade on the labor variables. However, from a quantitative standpoint, the base model is unable to replicate all the estimated responses of the labor market variables to the terms of trade. Alternative versions of the model are used to examine what elements are required to have quantitative predictions that are similar to the estimations.","[Pablo Medina, Juan] Fondo Monetario Int, Santiago, Chile; [Naudon, Alberto] Banco Cent Chile, Santiago, Chile",,"Medina, JP (通讯作者)，Fondo Monetario Int, Santiago, Chile.",jmedina@imf.org; anaudon@bcentral.d,,,,,,,31,2,3,0,4,BANCO CENTRAL CHILE,SANTIAGO,"MORANDE 115 2ND PISO, AUGUSTINAS 1180, SANTIAGO, 6500-590, CHILE",0717-3830,,,ECON CHIL,Econ.

This article attempts to help bridge the gap by allowing for both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of potential rebels. Simple non-cooperative bargaining yields a nonlinear impact of regulatory quality on the likelihood of conflict and shows that corruption and resource depletion jointly affect the outcome. The empirical analysis that follows looks at the effect of environmental depletion and government corruption on the emergence of civil conflicts using a large panel data set. Resource depletion, the quality of governance, and their interaction are found to be significant determinants of civil conflict incidence.

Innovation is followed by a costly process of standardization, whereby these new goods are adapted to be produced using unskilled labor. Our framework highlights a number of novel results. First, standardization is both an engine of growth and a potential barrier to it. As a result, growth is an inverse U-shaped function of the standardization rate (and of competition). Second, we characterize the growth and welfare maximizing speed of standardization. We show how optimal protection of intellectual property rights affecting the cost of standardization vary with the skill-endowment, the elasticity of substitution between goods and other parameters. Third, we show that, depending on how competition between innovating and standardizing firms is modelled and on parameter values, a new type of multiplicity of equilibria may arise. Finally, we study the implications of our model for the skill premium and we illustrate novel reasons for linking North South trade to intellectual property rights protection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The basic neoclassical model assumes that WMFs maximizes net income per member instead of total profits (Ward, 1958). Even though it has been largely criticized, the Ward model has dominated the self-management literature. Alternative models suggest that WMFs are not only concerned about income per worker but also about the level of employment. However, the empirical content of these competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed. This paper contributes to fill this gap by estimating the parameters of a generic welfare function, following the methodology proposed by Craig and Pencavel (1993). These parameters determine the relative importance that a WMF places on income per worker vis-a-vis the level of employment. Estimates are based on a long micro-panel of Uruguayan firms covering the entire population of Uruguayan worker-managed firm and conventional firms in 31 3-digit sectors over the period April 1996-December 2005. Following a strictly neoclassical framework, but simply allowing a more general specification of the WMF goals, we show that the assumption of the basic neoclassical model of the WMF is misleading. Our results support the view that WMFs are concerned with both employment and income per worker. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the basic Ricardian example, two countries do better by specializing in different goods and exchanging them for each other, even when one country is better at making both. This example typically gets presented in the first or second chapter of a text on international trade, and sometimes appears even in a principles text. But having served its pedagogical purpose, the model is rarely heard from again. The Ricardian model became something like a family heirloom, brought down from the attic to show a new generation of students, and then put back. Nearly two centuries later, however, the Ricardian framework has experienced a revival. Much work in international trade during the last decade has returned to the assumption that countries gain from trade because they have access to different technologies. These technologies may be generally available to producers in a country, as in the Ricardian model of trade, our topic here, or exclusive to individual firms. This line of thought has brought Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage back to center stage. Our goal is to make this new old trade theory accessible and to put it to work on some current issues in the international economy.","[Eaton, Jonathan] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kortum, Samuel] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Chicago,"Eaton, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jxe22@psu.edu; kortum@uchicago.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0820338] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,43,38,46,1,33,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Coming from different galaxies, formal approaches, such as system dynamics, network analysis, graph theory, or game theory have been further developed by institutional and evolutionary economists in order to close gaps and to further operationalize, formalize, and develop institutionalism. This paper strives to demonstrate that we can bridge gaps between the theory of institutional change and an evolutionary-institutional interpretation of game theory. This allows for a deeper analysis of institutions, the value base in game theory, the instrumental-ceremonial asymmetry, ceremonial dominance and encapsulation, and the institutionalist policy conception.

Moreover, we show that a cascade of flip bifurcations may lead to periodic cycles and ultimately chaotic behaviours. Since a higher degree of product differentiation implies weaker competition, then a theoretical implication of our findings, that also constitute a policy warning, is that a fiercer (weaker) competition tends to stabilise (destabilise) the unique positive Cournot-Nash equilibrium.

However, in order to explain pro-cyclical leverage it assumes that bad news increases volatility, that is, it assumes an inverse relationship between first and second moments of asset returns. This paper suggests a reason why bad news is more often than not associated with higher future volatility. We show that, in a model with endogenous leverage and heterogeneous beliefs, agents have the incentive to invest mostly in technologies that become more volatile in bad times. Agents choose these technologies because they can be leveraged more during normal time:;. Together with the existing literature this explains pro-cyclical leverage. The result also gives a rationale to the pattern of volatility smiles observed in stock options since 1987. Finally, the paper presents for the first time a dynamic model in which an asset is endogenously traded simultaneously at different margin requirements in equilibrium. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

One response to reducing the pressure on rural lands is for urban households to switch fuel sources, for example, from wood fuel to electricity, to slow deforestation and forest degradation and reduce indoor air pollution. However, such an energy transition is conditioned on the adoption of appropriate cooking appliances or stove technologies by the majority of users. This paper investigates urban energy transition and technology adoption conditions using a dataset of 350 urban households in Tigrai, in northern Ethiopia.

High and sustained GDP growth rates in China have paradoxically been accompanied by increasing unemployment rates and decreasing labor force participation rates. Using national representative micro data, estimations from logit models show that age, education, communist-party membership and marital status are significantly associated with participation in the labor force and employment opportunities, and the impacts of education and party membership have increased over time. An extension of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition finds little of the observed male-female differentials attributable to differences in characteristics such as age or education but to coefficient effects, a possible reflection of discrimination.

In the past, we focused on gains that stemmed either from endowment differences (wheat for iron ore) or inter-industry comparative advantage (David Ricardo's classic example of cloth for port). Today, we focus on three sources of gains from trade: 1) love-of-variety gains associated with intra-industry trade; 2) allocative efficiency gains associated with shifting labor and capital out of small, less-productive firms and into large, more-productive firms; and 3) productive efficiency gains associated with trade-induced innovation. This paper reviews these three sources of gains from trade both theoretically and empirically.

This paper investigates the usefulness of standard macroeconomic Bayesian VAR models to estimate the probability of a US recession. Defining a recession as two quarters in a row of negative GDP growth, the probability is estimated for two quarters of the most recent US recession, namely 2008Q3-2008Q4. In contrast to judgemental probabilities from this point in time, it is found that the BVAR assigns a very low probability to such an event. This is true also when survey data, which generally are considered as good leading indicators, are included in the models. We conclude that while Bayesian VAR models are good forecasting tools in many cases, the results in this paper raise question marks regarding their usefulness for predicting recessions.

These affect per capita incomes, which has repercussions for the income distribution even if wages remain constant. The aim of this paper is to quantify the proportion of changing household structures in the increase in inequality. We find that the growth of the income gap in Germany (for both East and West from 1991 to 2007) is indeed strongly related to changes in household structure and employment behavior, and a large part of this increase is compensated by the welfare state.","[Schneider, Hilmar] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] Univ Cologne, Inst Study Labor IZA, ISER, Cologne, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Cologne; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Schneider, H (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",schneider@iza.org,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018","Pestel, Nico/0000-0003-0062-9514",,,,,51,39,40,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We have two distinct research questions. First, does the gender composition of the group to which a student is randomly assigned affect competitive choices? Second, does the gender mix of the school a student attends affect competitive choices? Our subjects (students just under 15 years of age) attend publicly funded single-sex and coeducational schools. We find robust differences between the competitive choices of girls from single-sex and coed schools. Moreover, girls from single-sex schools behave more like boys even when randomly assigned to mixed-sex experimental groups. This suggests that it is untrue that the average female avoids competitive behavior more than the average male. It also suggests that observed gender differences might reflect social learning rather than inherent gender traits.

Recognizing this, public policies often pair competition with easy access to comparative information. The implicit assumption is that comparison friction-the wedge between the availability of comparative information and consumers' use of it-is inconsequential because when information is readily available, consumers will access this information and make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group received a letter with personalized cost information. That information was readily available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional step-providing the information rather than having consumers actively access it-had an impact. Plan switching was 28% in the intervention group, versus 17% in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 a year among letter recipients-roughly 5% of the cost in the comparison group. Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large even when the cost of acquiring information is small and may be relevant for a wide range of public policies that incorporate consumer choice.","Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Princeton University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,,,"Shafir, Eldar/H-9957-2014","Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052","NIA NIH HHS [P01 AG005842-20S1, P01 AG005842] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,26,177,213,1,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

When both the short and the very long run are important, one can appeal to overtaking criteria and Chichilnisky criteria. Unfortunately, overtaking criteria are highly incomplete. In order to decrease this incompleteness, stronger anonymity (or equity) axioms were developed. I show that a maximal anonymity axiom compatible with Pareto is a non-constructible object; its existence relies on the Axiom of Choice. The Chichilnisky criterion is based upon two axioms: non-dictatorship of the present and non-dictatorship of the future. Here, the very long run is captured by a finitely additive measure.

The economic literature on GHG emissions misleadingly focuses attention on the intergenerational equity aspects of mitigation by using a hybrid constrained optimal path as the business-as-usual benchmark.

While increasing incentives for auditors to provide information straightforwardly improves political control, a small amount of pro-incumbent bias can also be useful for maintaining high levels of control. When the equilibrium level of control is high, most investigations uncover positive information about the incumbent. Since positive information increases reelection rates, mildly pro-incumbent auditors are willing to work harder than unbiased auditors in these equilibria. For moderate levels of control, pro-incumbent auditors are again useful due to their extra effort, even though they may suppress some negative information in equilibrium.

We do so by constructing a model that allows universities to choose actively the quality of their teaching and research when faced with different funding systems characterised by the pivotal role of the university funding budget constraint. In particular, we derive the feasible sets that face universities under such systems and show how, as the parameters of the system (the research block grant element, the research quality premium and the incentives-triggering quality threshold) are varied, the nature of the university system itself changes. Different 'cultures' of the university system emerge such as the 'research elite' and the 'binary divide'.","[Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna] La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, CRIEFF, RCEA, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Beath, John; Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",La Trobe University; University of St Andrews,"Poyago-Theotoky, J (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, CRIEFF, RCEA, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.poyago-theotoky@latrobe.edu.au,"Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna/AAV-1132-2020; Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna/D-3301-2015","Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna/0000-0003-2957-6612; Poyago-Theotoky, Joanna/0000-0003-2957-6612",,,,,21,11,13,0,26,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JAN 12,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,20122.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-2,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,928AT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302952600001,0

Using a new cross-country comparable database, we examine the impact of age adjustments on wealth inequality across countries and over time.

This paper argues that the root causes of the crisis lie in the failure of many safety valves of market economies, at many levels of the society, both in the crisis countries and in the more prudent EMU countries, in an economic environment where unfettered finance can overwhelm even the biggest and best managed economies. Hence, the policy responses based on the conventional narrative are akin to treating the symptoms, not the disease. As such, they may be setting the foundations for a bigger crisis in the future by strengthening the always-present perverse incentives of many economic players and by proposing complex and unworkable regulatory and supervisory structures. This, together with the unequal sharing of the burden of adjustment-both across and within countries, bodes ill for the long-term prospects of EMU, despite that the aforementioned failures are not intrinsically related to the euro.","Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Antzoulatos, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Piraeus, Greece.",antzoul@unipi.gr,"Antzoulatos, Angelos/AAP-7824-2021",,,,,,15,9,9,0,13,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,5,,,,,529,552,,10.2298/PAN1205529A,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,068XA,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313398300001,0

However, in general, a relatively average performance in most of the selected EEC is accomplished with too many inputs so that efficiency is quite low.

All of these indices explicitly or implicitly assume that making more information available or making more precise information would automatically lead to greater transparency. In other words, the fundamental presumption of all these indices is that there is no friction in the conveyance of information. In this paper, by applying the conceptual framework proposed by Winkler (2000), transparency has been defined as the degree of genuine understanding of the monetary policy process and policy decisions by the public. In accordance with such a definition, an index based on the four elements of Openness, Clarity, Honesty and Common Understanding has been developed to measure the transparency of central banks. Using the proposed index for measuring the transparency of three major central banks: the Federal Reserve, the ECB and the Bank of England and comparing the results with that of Siklos(2010) reveals that not only our calculated transparency's score, but also our ranking is different from him. These two points highlight that central banks may find new ways of being transparent which could not be assessed just based on the openness on information, so the results of empirical studies conducted based on such indices could not be reliable.","[Bajalan, Saeed; Raei, Reza; Tehrani, Reza] Univ Tehran, Tehran 14174, Iran",University of Tehran,"Bajalan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Tehran 14174, Iran.",,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,9,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Considering just cause and social criteria requirements for three regulatory regimes representative of a large number of industrialized countries, we find that different regimes generate different dismissal decisions only if the regimes are strictly enforced. In contrast, unemployment rates may differ across regimes even in the case of weak enforcement. Additionally, we find that it may be worse for the economy to weakly enforce harmful regulations than to strictly enforce them. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It takes up the case of trade misreporting phenomena under the framework of protected regime. It builds up a basic trade mis-invoicing model and then develops collusion between underreporting traders of partner countries. I show that high tariff barrier gives incentives not only to the importers but also to the exporters to gain by underreporting the trade statistics. Interestingly, this paper shows that even if foreign exchange is fully floated, underground foreign exchange market can be created and exporters may rationally underreport without any gain through black market premium - a departure from conventional theory.","[Biswas, Amit K.] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Econ, Dresden, Germany; [Biswas, Amit K.] Visva Bharati Univ, Dept Econ & Polit, Santini Ketan, W Bengal, India",Technische Universitat Dresden; Visva Bharati University,"Biswas, AK (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Econ, Dresden, Germany.",biswas.amitk@gmail.com,"Biswas, Amit/AAU-5973-2020","Biswas, Amit/0000-0002-7756-773X",,,,,8,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This literature however assumes a perfect labour market. The central question addressed in this article is whether it is still desirable to increase the retirement age when individuals face the risk of being unemployed. In this purpose, we study the design of the Pay-As-You-Go pension system, focusing on the determination of the retirement age, in a model where people differ according to age only and face in every period a given probability of becoming unemployed. We first determine the optimal pension system, which consists in a payroll tax rate, a pension benefit level and a retirement age and study its comparative statics with respect to a change of the unemployment rate and the length of life. Our main findings are the following. First, it is optimal to postpone retirement when life expectancy increases. Second, when unemployment benefits are low the optimal retirement age may decrease with the unemployment rate. We then characterize the issue-by-issue voting equilibrium and compare it to the optimal pension scheme. It is shown that the median voter in general chooses a retirement age lower than the optimal one as well as a higher payroll tax rate.","[Casamatta, Georges] GREMAQ CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Casamatta, Georges] CEPR, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [De Paoli, Caroline] INRA, ISG, Paris, France; [De Paoli, Caroline] INRA, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; INRAE; Paris School of Economics,"Casamatta, G (通讯作者)，GREMAQ CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",georges.casamatta@tse-fr.eu,"Casamatta, Georges/AAE-7675-2022","Casamatta, Georges/0000-0001-6197-5846",,,,,14,1,1,0,21,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Bangang, on the Yunlin-Chiayi plain, was the biggest city in Taiwan during the period 1624-1720. However, the terrain of this area has changed greatly with the coastline moving toward the west about 20 meters per year. Therefore, many cities and harbours in this area were gradually replaced. As a result, much new land was created and many races immigrated into the area. The first Han Chinese migration was led by Yen Shih-Chi and Cheng Chih-Lung in 1624, and entered the coastal area of Yunlin-Chiayi for exploitation. By 1650 it had grown to 25 000 people and that huge number forced the Tsou tribe to begin moving toward Ali Mountain.","Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Chang, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",kimichang@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For this purpose, we develop an infinitely repeated rent-seeking game between two groups of different size. We first investigate Nash reversion strategies to support cooperative behavior in both groups, before analyzing double-edge trigger strategies which support cooperation in one group only. These last strategies have the property that cheating on the agreement in the cooperative group is followed by non-cooperation in this group and cooperation in the rival group. The main conclusion is that the set of parameters for which cooperation can be sustained within the larger group as a subgame perfect outcome is as large as that for which cooperation can be sustained in the smaller group. Hence, in contrast to Olson's (1965) celebrated thesis, but in accordance with many informal and formal observations, larger groups can be as effective as smaller groups in furthering their interests.

The aim of this study is to propose a model that will help firms in making this kind of decisions. The model proposed in this paper - ALIRETI model, puts employees' stress level in the central place. There was a hypothesis introduced that based on stress level analyses in correlation with particular parameters of business, the recommendations for improvements can be reached. As a data collection tool, two questionnaires were used. The first questionnaire was related to stress test. The purpose of the second questionnaire was to determine employees' attitudes towards predefined business parameters. In order to get information about what should be changed first Work Stress Index - WSI is introduced. Higher value of WSIi indicates that in the case of the lack of resources for comprehensive changes, higher priority in improvement should be given to business parameter i. The ALIRETI model was tested and verified in a research carried out in Serbian Post. One of the improvement points that were indicated as a result of the model's implementation was the communication between dispatcher and couriers. This segment of courier service is further analyzed in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are: the design of a new model for the allocation of limited resources for technological improvement, a manifestation of model's applicability and a proposal of new communication system for courier service in Serbian Post.","[Dobrodolac, Momcilo; Markovic, Goran; Cubranic-Dobrodolac, Marjana; Cicevic, Svetlana] Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Dobrodolac, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Vojvode Stepe St 305, Belgrade, Serbia.",m.dobrodolac@gmail.com; g.markovic@sf.bg.ac.rs; marjana@sf.bg.ac.rs; s.cicevic@sf.bg.ac.rs,"Čilević, Svetlana/JRY-7412-2023; Marković, Goran Z/AAD-1065-2019; Dobrodolac, Momčilo/I-3509-2017","Marković, Goran Z/0000-0003-1271-9277;",,,,,18,3,3,1,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In an economic downturn when most workers face falling real wages is it appropriate to let the MW fall or are the positive effects of the MW on inequality enough to justify its uprating and if so what might be the consequences on a countrys employment level? This paper reports new estimates of the employment effects of the MW by focusing on the recessionary experiences across countries. Using international data we exploit: cross-national variation in the level and timing of the MW uprating and the exact timing of the recessionary experiences in different countries with a panel data set comprising 33 OECD over the period 19712009. Our panel data allow us to differentiate the effect of MWs on employment in periods of economic downturn as well as periods of economic growth. We also account for institutional and other policy related differences that might have an impact on employment other than the MW. We find that the answer depends on whether one considers adults or young people, and to some extent, on what measure of the MW is considered. The answer is also somewhat sensitive to whether one considers that the MW level is a choice option of the government which is inextricably interrelated to the determination of employment that is, the extent to which the MW is endogenous. Using a political complexion of the government instrumental variable (IV) we find that the MW only has a negative impact on youth employment.

It is argued that Schumpeter's approach can be developed into a new-more general-micro-meso-macro framework in economics. Center stage is meso. Its essential characteristic is bimodality, meaning that one idea (the generic rule) can be physically actualized by many agents (a population). Ideas can relate to others, and, in this way, meso constitutes a structure component of a 'deep' invisible macro structure. Equally, the rule actualization process unfolds over time-modelled in the paper as a meso trajectory with three phases of rule origination, selective adoption and retention-and here meso represents a process component of a visible 'surface' structure. The macro measure with a view to the appropriateness of meso components is generic correspondence. At the level of ideas, its measure is order; at that of actual relative adoption frequencies, it is generic equilibrium. Economic development occurs at the deep level as transition from one generic rule to another, inducing a change of order, and, at the surface level, as the new rule is adopted, destroying an old equilibrium and establishing a new one.","Univ St Gallen, CH-9010 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Dopfer, K (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Sandrainstr 21, CH-9010 St Gallen, Switzerland.",kurt.dopfer@unisg.ch,,,,,,,86,48,58,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Although it offers increased realism, especially in describing how local characteristics generate global patterns, it suffers from a simplistic approach to modeling local behaviors and rules. From this perspective the paper suggests possible solutions in two directions. First, the paper uses neural networks as an instrument for the agents to scan their local environment and infer possible behaviors. Second, the paper defines and applies an algorithm enabling the agents to understand a subset of rules that are not defined at the beginning of the application. The goal is to see how it is possible to generate new rules with structure and semantics. This would constitute real learning, namely defining new rules but not only quantitative variations of the initial rules.","Romanian Acad, NIER, CISE, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Dospinescu, AS (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, NIER, CISE, Bucharest, Romania.",andrei@ince.ro,,"Dospinescu, Andrei Silviu/0000-0002-1653-7190",,,,,22,1,1,0,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

I show that net contributions to DB plans are counter-cyclical, while net contributions to DC plans are uncorrelated with the business cycle. Given the past mean reversion in equity prices, the counter-cyclicality of net contributions to DB plans means that dollar-weighted returns on DB plans are higher than the geometric average of annual returns. Therefore, using dollar-weighted returns as a measure of investment performance, the advantage of DB plans over DC plans is greater than using geometric average returns. Overall, I find that dollar-weighted returns on DB plans are more than one percentage point higher than that on DC plans.","Union Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Dvorak, T (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",dvorakt@union.edu,"Dvořák, Tomáš/JKI-9583-2023",,,,,,14,1,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Such asymmetries may undermine the physician/patient relationship. And given these asymmetries, patient trust may play an important role in successful physician/patient relationships. This agency relationship has been studied for many years in the context of Fee-for-Service (FFS) reimbursement. But the market has changed considerably given the combination of an influx of information and the penetration of managed care - both of which have shifted some decision-making power away from the physician. An additional important factor in the physician/agency relationship that is also changing is patient trust. Where patient trust was implicit in the system with predicted positive effects on health outcomes when FFS was the norm, now trust itself is not a given, and its effect on the doctor-patient relationship may be evolving. We study how trust impacts patients' perceptions about quality of care, and whether these relationships differ by health insurance type. We find that Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) patients have significantly lower trust in their primary care physicians than those with more traditional coverage. Using a multi-dimensional index of patients' perceptions about the quality of care they receive from their physicians, we also find that trust has no significant effect on perceived quality for non-HMO patients, but significantly improves perceived outcomes for HMO patients. We conclude that trusting patients are more likely to have a better doctor-patient relationship than those who are skeptical in the HMO setting. Perhaps given lack of provider choice, it requires a level of trust in general to be compliant and satisfied with assigned physicians. In the non-HMO setting where consumers are now armed with more information and free to make choices, trust becomes less important. These results have implications for how decisions are made in the market for health services we face today and ultimately for public health policy.","[Dwyer, Debra] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Hlth Policy & Management, HSC, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rizzo, John A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Prevent Med & Econ, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Dwyer, D (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Hlth Policy & Management, HSC, Level 2,Room 415, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",debra.dwyer@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,28,11,15,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although a knowledge of farm households' potential for non-farm income diversification seems important for finely targeting such policy measures, thus far no attempt has been made to summarise the various determinants of income diversification in a single figure. This contribution aims to close this gap. A composite fuzzy indicator that measures farm households' potential for non-farm income diversification is developed and applied to 626 small-scale farm households in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovenia. The indicator summarises the incentives and capacities for non-farm income diversification on the individual household member level and on the household and regional levels in a single measure using fuzzy logic methodology. The composite fuzzy indicator performs well and the results for the single small-scale farm households can easily be retraced. The indicator not only singles out the households that have the potential for non-farm income diversification but also shows the reasons for this. The indicator shows that most of the 626 households studied have a high potential for non-farm income diversification and that all are pushed toward diversification by the small size of their farms. The composite fuzzy indicator also identifies farm households that are trapped in a desperate situation due to unfavourable chances of finding a job in the labour market and long distances to the nearest large urban centre. Decision makers could utilise the composite fuzzy indicator to finely target diversification measures to the multifaceted conditions of farm households.","Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Fritzsch, J (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",fritzsch@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,,,,,34,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,3,,,,,403,417,,10.1080/14631377.2012.705473,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,989WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307591500006,0

As these are implemented, policy makers must understand the way these programs work. In this review, we describe the basic features of carbon offset markets, along with the potential supply of offsets from agricultural sources and associated cost considerations. In this discussion we highlight the role of institutional design of contracts and transactions costs.

According to the empirical literature, which analyzes the determinants of willingness-to-pay (WTP) values from a bidding process, the double-hurdle is the most appropriate econometric approach to account for zero and protest WTP. However, when the number of protest responses is too small to be explicitly modelled, this approach is not applicable. This frequently occurs in critical health care situations, where large samples are not easily available. We discuss the possible econometric strategies for use in such cases. For illustrative purposes, the different models were applied to an empirical situation, which refers to the location preference (i.e. home versus hospital) from French cancer patients for blood transfusion. Our results show that protest responses should not be discarded, even if present in small numbers, and that the type II Tobit and the standard truncated regression model could both be applied. However, since from small finite samples, the most robust estimation is obtained from the bootstrap method with a high number of replications, the truncated regression model, easily applicable, weakly computer time-consuming and not subject to identification problems in this case contrary to the type II Tobit, should be the econometric strategy of choice for various WTP studies in the healthcare field.","[Havet, Nathalie] Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Morelle, Magali; Remonnay, Raphael; Carrere, Marie-Odile] Leon Berard Comprehens Canc Ctr, GATE Lyon St Etienne, F-69373 Lyon 08, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; UNICANCER; Centre Leon Berard; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2,"Havet, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, 93 Chemin Mouilles, F-69130 Ecully, France.",havet@gate.cnrs.fr; morelle@lyon.fnclcc.fr; raphael_remonnay@sfr.fr; mo.carrere@wanadoo.fr,"Havet, Nathalie/AHC-2729-2022",,,,,,57,9,9,0,12,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

As anticipated, most of the changes in welfare after full liberalization of trade between Serbia and EU can be expected in sectors where Serbia has specialized; protection against imports from the EU is strong. However, losses could also occur in sectors that currently face strong protection against the rest of the world and this protection is lost after EU accession.

Accordingly, it is shown that a two regime Smooth Transition Error Correction Model (STECM) is appropriate to reproduce the dynamics of stock price deviations from fundamentals in the G7 countries during the period 1969 to 2005. This model takes into account the interdependences or contagion effects between stock markets. Deviations appear to follow a quasi random walk in the central regime when prices are near fundamentals (i.e. when arbitrage costs are greater than expected arbitrage profits, the mean reversion mechanism is inactive), while they approach a white noise in the outer regimes (i.e. when arbitrage costs are lower than expected arbitrage profits, the mean reversion is active). Interestingly, as expected when arbitrage costs are heterogeneous, the estimated STECM shows that stock price adjustments are smooth and that the convergence speed depends on the size of the deviation. Finally, using two appropriate indicators proposed by Peel and Taylor (2000), both the magnitudes of under and overvaluation of stock price and the adjustment speed are calculated per date in the G7 countries. These indicators show that the dynamics of stock price adjustment are strongly dependent on both the date and the country under consideration.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, UFR Sci Gest & Sci Sociales, F-91025 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] Amiens Sch Management, F-80038 Amiens, France; [Jawadi, Fredj; Prat, Georges] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, CNRS, F-92001 Nanterre, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Nanterre; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, UFR Sci Gest & Sci Sociales, F-91025 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,58,14,14,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Initially the world economy is in a long-run equilibrium without taxes and government expenditures. The government of one country then makes a transfer to the old generation, and finances the transfer through the issuance of government debts. Thereafter, this government adopts a debt management policy to maintain the debt per young individual at a constant level. The current young generation of the country is better-off if the interest rate is slightly higher than the population growth rate, but is worse-off if the factor share of capital in national income is high. Along the equilibrium path, the welfare of a generation is lower than that of its predecessor in each country. In the long run, the welfare in both countries is lower under the new steady state.","[Jung, Young-Cheol] Thompson Rivers Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC, Canada; [Quyen, Nguyen V.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Jung, YC (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, 900 McGill Rd, Kamloops, BC, Canada.",yjung@tru.ca; Nguyen.Quyen@uOttawa.ca,,"Xuan Quyen, Nguyen/0000-0003-0549-4380",,,,,19,0,0,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

It is undisputed that all of these aspects are affected not only by market forces, but they also are significantly influenced by political and other microeconomic parameters including so-called soft factors of growth. On the whole, it influences directly or indirectly behaviour of individual economic actors, especially private businesses which can cause government interference by return and all together provoke the macroeconomic impact sui generis. However, national economies are not isolated economic islands, but they are part of geographically defined economic units, as well as they may be part of institutionalized economic groupings. This article focuses on the development of investment efficiency in the globalized world including the role of technical and technological progress. The aim of the article is to capture differences in the development of wealth creation and allocated investments on continents with higher intensity of globalization processes i.e. after 1970. It will also assess the context of the sector structure of economies, particularly the global impact of intensive development of the tertiary sector and especially by continents. Particular attention is devoted to comparing the situation of two relatively small open economies the Czech Republic and Japan. They differ from each other by their relationship to integration groupings. The Czech economy is a small open economy and a part of the integration grouping - the European Union - since spring 2004. Japan is an island country, open in particular way out, but still outside the integration grouping with a strong focus on its historical and cultural traditions. The authors are trying to answer the question to what extent and whether the integration of national economy affects positively its integration into higher integration units in the reality of the globalized world. Furthermore, they are trying to answer the question to what extent the dynamics of economic growth is affected by the ability of creation and use of science, research and innovation outcomes. Both of these two main streams of reasoning are interconnected in a subsequent assessment of the effect of economic growth and competitiveness of both countries. Each country is related to other continent with different expected characteristics of sector structures and investment activities, while there also is a perception of non-economic factors affecting the achievement of prosperity in the background. The fundamental basis is the holistic approach, which enables to perceive economic issues from taking a bird's-eye view, look away from specific details and enable them to subsequent return, especially since they affect the integrity in the result. It is possible to draw useful conclusions for potential acceleration of economic growth from these relevant facts. As a tool to achieve goals is the application of standard methods of economic research - abstraction, induction, deduction, comparison, analysis, synthesis, as well as appropriate statistical methods and graphical analysis.","[Kraft, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic; [Kraftova, Ivana] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; University of Pardubice,"Kraft, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",Jiri.Kraft@tul.cz; Ivana.Kraftova@upce.cz,"Kraftova, Ivana/G-8935-2017; Kraft, Jiri/P-2722-2017","Kraft, Jiri/0000-0002-4269-0009; Kraftova, Ivana/0000-0003-0740-2670",,,,,32,8,9,0,30,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Appropriate confidence intervals are estimated with a sieve bootstrap designed for our small time sample, preserving the dependence structure among cross sectional units.

The important phase of optimization process is the choice of suitable optimization criterion. Generally the optimization criterion must fulfill two basic conditions. It must express the real interest of an operator (should take in account the problems which an operator needs to remove) and must be also well quantifiable. In the submitted report there are used two criterions for suggestion of distributive system structure - the costs for maintenance of distributive system are minimized and reliability of delivery in time is maximized.

In an overlapping generations model, where health status in adulthood depends on health in childhood, adult agents allocate their time to work, leisure and childrearing activities. Humanitarian aid influences the probability of survival to adulthood, health in childhood, and the time that adults allocate to childrearing, giving rise to an ambiguous effect on both fertility and growth. An empirical investigation for the period 19732007 suggests that humanitarian aid has on average a zero effect on the rates of fertility and of per capita output growth.","[Neanidis, Kyriakos C.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Neanidis, Kyriakos C.] Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Neanidis, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Neanidis, Kyriakos/0000-0001-5258-2688",,,,,64,6,8,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2012,79.0,313,,,,,27,61,,10.1111/j.1468-0335.2010.00869.x,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,862BD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000298063900002,0

An equilibrium-selection mechanism is assumed to exist, and deliver a unique outcome for any given profile of payoffs; this allows the evolution of payoffs to be modeled as a well-defined replicator dynamics. The existing static stability results that efficient strict Nash implies stability and stability implies efficiency are translated to this dynamic context, although the latter gives way to indeterminacy in the absence of a specific equilibrium-selection mechanism. A strong form of stability is established for the efficient outcome of games with common interests, whilst a weaker stability result is provided for efficient mixed-strategy equilibria of doubly symmetric games. The results are illustrated using the equilibrium-selection mechanism provided by global games. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We compare the two waves of the Italian Time Use dataset (1988 and 2002) to analyse how family time allocation changed over time in a country that was undergoing a marked increase in female employment rate and a continuous decline in total fertility rate. We focus especially on how parents' time with their children depends on their employment status and household characteristics. Using a simultaneous sequential approach, we consider links among the different time uses of individuals and correlations with spouses' decisions. We find that wives' time at work time strongly influences the time spent by both spouses with their children in 2002, but not in 1988. Fathers were much more involved in childcare and rearing in 2002 than in 1988. In general, as women's work time increased, substitutes for their childcare time were found within the household (fathers or other co-resident adults).","[Pasqua, Silvia] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Finance, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Pasqua, Silvia] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy; [Mancini, Anna Laura] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Pasqua, S (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Finance, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",silvia.pasqua@unito.it,,,,,,,36,10,11,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Despite this incomprehension on the part of the politics and general public, STT index remain the perfect indicator from the point of the relative poverty measures, because it is able to capture more than one aspect of monetary poverty, satisfies the requirements dictated by Sen's ethical axioms for the poverty measures, and is based on the well-known statistical indices. All indices are dependent on the official poverty threshold, which is consequently reflected in the index value. We eliminate influence of the fixed poverty thresholds by the poverty curves construction, which are computed using all possible reasonable poverty thresholds.

With data from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, we show that an extended Solow (1956) model can narrow this gap.

In this paper, a meta-analysis of nineteen choice modeling (CM) studies in Australia is conducted generating 145 individual value estimates relating to river health. Implicit prices of different measures and scales of river health were transformed into a common standard of willingness to pay (WTP) per kilometer of river in good health. A Tobit model was used to identify the relationships between this dependent variable and a large number of study design characteristics. While there is evidence that the dimensions of choice tasks and description of attributes influence value estimates, there is also evidence that the way tradeoffs and payment mechanisms are framed are equally important. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that more attention should be paid to the way tradeoffs are framed in choice experiments relative to internal choice set structure and data analysis.","[Rolfe, John] CQUniv, Ctr Environm Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Central Queensland University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，CQUniv, Ctr Environm Management, Bruce Highway, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au; r.brouwer@vu.nl,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",,,,,54,21,21,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The paper offers a rational-choice model for addressing the individual's eating dilemma in an-all-you-can-eat buffet, incorporating the motivation of getting-one's-money's-worth as a behavioral constraint on eating. Contrary to previous findings, the model reveals that the individual will not necessarily overeat beyond the point of fullness and will not necessarily increase eating in response to a higher entry price. An experiment conducted in collaboration with a sushi restaurant supports this conclusion. The paper further shows that a fat tax imposed on both buffet and a-la-carte meals will not affect buffet eating, hence subjecting all-you-can-eat buffets to the fat tax program need not be counter-effective as the literature results imply.","[Siniver, Erez; Yaniv, Gideon] COMAS, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel",,"Siniver, E (通讯作者)，COMAS, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",sinivr@colman.ac.il; gidyan@colman.ac.il,,,,,,,14,4,7,1,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This article estimates the relative technical and cost efficiency of Bulgarian universities and explores the correlation between public funding and efficiency levels. In particular, a recent government proposal to use university rankings for the allocation of funds is evaluated with regard to efficiency. The results indicate that public universities are less efficient than private institutions, especially in teaching-related aspects. A larger share of the education market, fewer fields of study and more science-related majors result in efficiency gains. Efficiency is not a significant determinant of the amounts of subsidy allocated to a university, while the rankings of efficiency and funding are found to be negatively correlated. However, the rankings to be used under the proposed policy are positively related to cost efficiency, suggesting that the reform effort is a step in the right direction.","[Tochkov, Kiril] Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Nenovsky, Nikolay] Univ Picardie, CRIISEA, F-80025 Amiens, France; [Nenovsky, Nikolay] Univ Orleans, STUDIUM LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Tochkov, Karin] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas Christian University; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Universite de Orleans; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Tochkov, K (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",k.tochkov@tcu.edu,"Tochkov, Kiril/F-1779-2017","Nenovsky, Nikolay/0000-0002-9544-9024; Tochkov, Kiril/0000-0001-8356-1310",,,,,29,20,22,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,4,,,,,517,534,,10.1080/14631377.2012.729306,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,029HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310485500006,0

Based on Labour Force Survey data for 1996-2006 we find the existence of adverse selection in the Croatian labour market. Reservation wage, as the main determinant of firing costs in the model, positively affects the probability of changing job for employed job seekers, while it has a negative impact on the probability of 'switching' for unemployed job seekers. However, if reservation wage is treated as endogenous in the model, instrumental variable estimation shows that its effect on the probability of 'switching' becomes positive and significant only for the unemployed group. This is explained by the effect of educational attainment, which serves as the 'instrument' and obviously works as an efficient signal for workers' productivity among the unemployed. Nevertheless, the effect of reservation wage on employment probabilities for both groups is declining over time, especially after the legislative reform in 2004, indicating a lower impact of firing costs. Finally, the hypothesis on self-discrimination of the unemployed receiving unemployment benefits is tested, showing a positive impact of unemployment benefits on the reservation wage and a negative one on the probability of finding a job.","[Tomic, Iva] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Domadenik, Polona] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Ljubljana,"Tomic, I (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia.",itomic@eizg.hr,"Tomic, Iva/I-9416-2012; Tomic, Iva/N-3334-2019","Tomic, Iva/0000-0002-4706-7881; Domadenik Muren, Polona/0000-0002-1672-7955",,,,,46,8,8,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24.0,1,,,,,39,72,,10.1080/14631377.2012.647969,0.0,,,34,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,918PH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302262100003,0

Do industrial countries gain more from trade? Do world trade booms over the past two centuries help account for the widening gap between rich and poor countries because of some asymmetric growth impact? These old questions can now be answered with hard evidence, and the answer is yes to all three. World trade booms have always been associated with commodity price booms and thus with terms-of-trade improvements favoring the commodity exporter. But whereas commodity exporters' GDP levels increased-that is, they gained from trade-their growth rates either did not increase or increased by much less than did rates of their industrial trading partners.

Most recent contributions argue that inconclusive results among studies are likely to be related to the instability of causal relationships over time or over frequencies. To unify these two aspects in one approach, we compute a time-varying Diebold-Yilmaz (2012) spillover measure for the relationship between output and growth at different frequency scales which are obtained from discrete wavelet transforms. Our results confirm the time and scale dependence of causalities between export and output growth in India in the period 1960 to 2011. This new methodological approach can also be applied to systems of more than two variables and thus shows an avenue to modelling the time and scale dependence of causalities between many other economic variables.","[Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] ICFAI Univ Tripura, Fac Management, Agartla, India; [Ludwig, Alexander] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Ludwig, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, Dresden, Germany.",alexander.ludwig@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,"Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263",,,,,10,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Many studies have focused on how the CAFE standard can be met by various automakers that have sales in the US market, and the costs and benefits of the companies meeting the standard. However, the stock markets' view on the impact of the standard on automakers' profitability is largely absent. We study the more recent episode of the CAFE regulation in an effort to try to detect the market response using the standard event study method. Our empirical findings suggest that while the stock market had some responses to the regulation, the large-scale and systematic reaction to the regulation is absent. In addition, the market response pattern to the regulation appears to be tied to the individual company's compliance condition if there is any significant response at all.","[Burdina, Mariya; Wright, Michael; Zhu, Zhen] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Edmond, OK 73034 USA",University of Central Oklahoma,"Zhu, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.",zzhu@uco.edu,"Zhu, Zhen/AAD-6897-2019",,,,,,16,0,0,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It terminated the dual corporate income tax regime by removing the preferential tax treatments offered to foreign investment enterprises (FIEs) and unifying the corporate income tax regime for FIEs and Chinese domestic enterprises (DEs). This article uses a difference-in-differences approach to determine whether FIEs responded to the law by shifting income out of China. Employing the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database from 2002 to 2008 to implement the analysis, we find that FIEs have responded to the law by shifting income out of China; the treatment effect for Hong Kong-Macau-Taiwan (HMT) investment enterprises is less negative than that for other FIEs, which implies that HMT investment enterprises might be less capable of shifting income across countries than other FIEs. The treatment effect by restricting the control group to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) is less negative than that by restricting the control group to Private-Owned Enterprises (POEs), which is consistent with the perception that SOEs might enjoy more favorable treatment from the Chinese government than POEs. All three findings are consistent with tax-induced income shifting, and hence we conclude that taxation plays an important role in income shifting activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Valuations of housing are necessary in order to assess the benefits and liabilities in housing sector. This study presents a flexible meta-modelling approach for improvement of housing price estimation in ambiguous and complex environments. It is composed of artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy linear regression (FLR). Seven FLR models are considered to cover latest approaches and viewpoints. Also, ANN is applied to data sets. The preferred FLR model is selected via mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE) for further considerations, and then the preferred FLR model and the best structure of ANN are applied to the data set. Finally, the preferred model is selected based on MAPE. The intelligent approach of this study is applied for estimation and forecasting housing price in Iran. The housing price in Iran mainly is based on eight economic indices including currency, oil income, general index, house service pricing index, rate of informal market, gross domestic production in basic price, added value of oil group and construction materials price. FLR is identified as the preferred model with lowest MAPE for housing price forecasting in Iran. This shows that the housing market of Iran is associated with severe environmental fuzziness and ambiguity. This is the first study that introduces a flexible neuro-fuzzy approach for improved estimation and forecasting of housing price in noisy, complex and uncertain environments.","[Azadeh, Ali; Sheikhalishahi, Mohammad; Boostani, Ali] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Azadeh, Ali; Sheikhalishahi, Mohammad; Boostani, Ali] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Ctr Excellence Intelligent Based Expt Mech, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; University of Tehran,"Azadeh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Ind & Syst Engn, POB 11365, Tehran, Iran.",aazadeh@ut.ac.ir,"Azadeh, Ali/C-5517-2015; Sheikhalishahi, Mohammad/T-6032-2018","Sheikhalishahi, Mohammad/0000-0002-4134-9263",,,,,45,13,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Measured as the percentage of trading volume on the first trading day against the total number of shares offered, flipping is the quickest way to gain huge profits from IPOs. However, excessive flipping activity has significant potential to create artificial downward pressure on the price of IPOs. One way to reduce such an adverse effect is by strategically allocating a larger proportion of new shares to institutional investors. This is because institutional investors are normally assumed to be long-term investors. As such, they are less likely to flip their allocated IPOs in the immediate aftermarket. The long-term investment argument is consistent with institutional investors' preference for a steady income stream in the form of dividends. Drawing upon this argument, the greater participation of institutional investors during an IPO is expected to be an effective strategy to control aggressive flipping activity. The Malaysian IPO market offers an excellent opportunity to examine this hypothesis because data regarding the allocation of new shares to institutional investors can be traced conveniently through a type of IPO referred to as private placement. Based upon an examination of 248 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia between January 2000 and December 2012, this study finds a negative relationship between institutional investors' participation and flipping activity. This result lends strong support to the argument concerning the effectiveness of institutional investors' participation in controlling flipping activity in the Malaysian IPO market.

Fundamental features of most models of charitable giving are the inclusion of externalities induced by other agents and the Lancasterian characteristics approach to specifying utility functions. This paper develops a general, revealed-preference methodology for testing a variety of preference structures that allow for both externalities and characteristics. The tests are simple linear programs that are transparent, computationally efficient, and straightforward to implement. We show how the technique applies to standard models of privately provided public goods and novel models that account for other-regarding preferences based on relative consumption and donations among individuals. We also conduct an original experiment that enables testing and comparing many models on a single data set. Our experiment design allows us to focus on intrinsic motivations which are often hard to disentangle from other extrinsic or image effects in field data. The results provide the first revealed-preference evidence on the importance of social comparisons when individuals make charitable contributions. Models that include preferences for either relative consumption or donations yield significantly greater explanatory power than the standard model of impure altruism. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, between 1980 and 2009, GM's US market share fell from 46 to 20 percent, and in 2009 the firm went bankrupt. We argue that the conventional explanation for this decline-namely high legacy labor and healthcare costs-is seriously incomplete, and that GM's share collapsed for many of the same reasons that many highly successful American firms of the 1960s were forced from the market, including a failure to understand the nature of the competition they faced and an inability to respond effectively once they did. We focus particularly on the problems GM encountered in developing the relational contracts essential to modern design and manufacturing, and we discuss a number of possible causes for these difficulties. We suggest that GM's experience may have important implications for our understanding of the role of management in the modern, knowledge-based firm and for the potential revival of manufacturing in the United States.","[Helper, Susan] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Henderson, Rebecca] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Harvard University,"Helper, S (通讯作者)，US Dept Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 USA.",susan.helper@case.edu; Rhenderson@hbs.edu,,,,,,,77,64,78,0,75,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Several theoretical arguments are given for this, both from the economic and psychological literature. Estimation results point at three important mechanisms that may explain declining hiring probabilities with age: (1) Uncertainty about productivity levels of older job-seekers may cause risk averse employers to chose younger job-seekers with lower, but more certain productivity levels. All factors and policy measures that are informative about productivity levels and reduce uncertainty for employers, also increase the average hiring probability for older job-seekers. (2) Increasing labour costs compared to steady or declining productivity levels of older workers. Some of these costs are determined on a national level, but many are negotiated between employers and employees in central bargaining agreements. Employers themselves therefore have an important key to increase the attractiveness of older job-seekers. (3) Older managers hire more older job-seekers, the same is true for employers with an older workforce. It means that in an ageing society, the hiring probability of older job-seekers will increase, even if no additional policy measures are taken. The effect of this ageing is stronger than any of the policy measures analysed in our study.","[Heyma, Arjan; van der Werff, Siemen] SEO Econ Res, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nauta, Aukje] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nauta, Aukje; van Sloten, Guurtje] Factor Five, Cologne, Germany",University of Amsterdam,"Heyma, A (通讯作者)，SEO Econ Res, Roetersstr 29, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.heyma@seo.nl; s.vanderwerff@seo.nl,,,,,,,53,6,9,0,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2014,162.0,4,,,,,397,414,,10.1007/s10645-014-9239-3,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AS3IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000344170000005,0

Using a stated preference design, decision makers make hypothetical transport choices under three decision scenarios. The choices are made under conditions of three, five, and seven alternatives per choice set. Further, we analyze the data from these three experiments simultaneously using factor-analytic structural choice models. We fit these models because they allow us to specify a latent structure representing a behavioral process of antecedent volition. Past research emphasizes differences in aggregate preferences due to context effects, but is incomplete in some important respects. Model parameters of the most theoretically appealing specification include estimates of means (i.e., aggregate preferences for the attributes studied) and regression coefficients for the effects of latent variables on the taste sensitivities common to the decision scenarios (i.e., structure of preferences in relation to the attributes). Extending past research, we find evidence of latent variables and structures that are common to the taste sensitivities of specific attributes across the decision scenarios (i.e., sources of preference heterogeneity and a structure to the heterogeneity). This pattern of results is suggestive of a behavioral process consistent with literature and theory on antecedent volition. Our model forms and results have implications for policymakers and researchers. They are especially salient to recent literature contrasting context effects with the notion of stable and inherent preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our solution is based on an elaborate specification of the cost function faced by firms and the formulation of a reduced-form production function which is characterised by non-linear input-output relations. The resultant Phillips curve features the standard hybrid expectational term, labour share, output gap, speed-limit effects and supply shock variables. In general, GMM estimations of the model for developed and emerging markets yield a positive and significant coefficient on the labour share and the output gap.

The evidence from Chinese manufacturing firms reveals a complementarity between exporting and R&D investment in their impacts on firm's productivity. The complementarity test is implemented based on the supermodularity theory. After disentangling the selection bias from the decision to export and to invest R&D through mixed multinomial Logit regression, the multinomial treatment effect estimation identifies that the joint decisions improve firms' labor productivity by 0.283. Moreover, the exporting status increases firms' tendency to invest in R&D, and vice versa, thus implying the existence of complementarity from the view of firms' decision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Liquidity and clearing as alternative principles for reforming international money,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,John Maynard Keynes; International monetary system; Bretton Woods; Clearing union; International Monetary Fund; Liquidity,,"In the face of the current crisis, there is growing demand for regulation, often invoked in terms of a 'return to Bretton Woods'. The Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 was indeed the last explicit attempt to define a rule for international settlements. In fact, post-World War II currency negotiations gave place to a confrontation between two alternative visions of the international monetary system. The two plans set forth by the U.S. and by the U.K. embody two alternative principles: the first aims at producing international liquidity on the basis of a reserve currency (White's plan for an International Stabilization Fund); the second aims at providing a pure means and measure for the multilateral clearing of current accounts in the form of a currency unit (Keynes's plan for an International Clearing Union). The former has undoubtedly prevailed. However, it is questionable whether it is the most appropriate way to manage global imbalances. Indeed, the principle eventually embodied in the Bretton Woods system, and persisting even after its demise, tends to identify money with a reserve asset, making possible, and even necessary, the accumulation of global imbalances, despite original intentions to reabsorb them. On the contrary, the principle that inspired the alternative plan was intended to deprive money of the character of a reserve asset, thus making it the rule for international exchanges, rather than an object of regulation among others. This paper outlines the two principles both in historical perspective and in the perspective of future reforms, particularly in relation to the recent proposal by the governor of the People's Bank of China to go back to the principles of the Keynes plan.","[Amato, Massimo; Fantacci, Luca] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Fantacci, L (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy.",luca.fantacci@unibocconi.it,"Amato, Massimo/AAC-7387-2022; Fantacci, Luca/AAX-6829-2021","FANTACCI, LUCA/0000-0001-7485-3282",,,,,39,20,20,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Then, for the class of monotone information systems, we characterize the weakest information criteria that respect OS and imply the dispersion orders. Our characterizations consist of intuitive conditions on the joint distributions of signals and states.

We argue that the duration of cleanup, conditional on a large number of site characteristics, should be independent of the race and income profile of the neighborhood in which the site is located. Since the demographic composition of a neighborhood changes during the cleanup process, we explore whether cleanup durations are related to neighborhood demographics recorded at the time when the cleanup is initiated. We estimate a semiparametric Bayesian Proportional Hazard model, which also allows for unobserved site specific heterogeneity, and find that sites located in black, urban and lower educated neighborhoods were discriminated against at the beginning of the program but that the degree of bias diminished over time. Executive Order 12898 of 1994 appears to have re-prioritized resources for the faster cleanup of sites located in less wealthy neighborhoods. We do not find that the litigation process is an impediment in the cleanup process, and support the notion that community involvement plays an important role. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our context is Norway's disability insurance (DI) system. To overcome the challenge of correlated unobservables across generations, we take advantage of random assignment of judges to DI applicants whose cases are initially denied. Some appeal judges are systematically more lenient, which leads to random variation in the probability a parent will be allowed DI. Using this exogenous variation, we find strong evidence for a causal link across generations: when a parent is allowed DI at the appeal stage, their adult child's participation over the next five years increases by 6 percentage points. This effect grows over time, rising to 12 percentage points after 10 years.

Consistent with the notion of a commodity price beta for oil industry stocks, there is a positive correlation between returns to the spot price of WTI and ConocoPhillips. This correlation indicates not all price changes in crude oil are expected to persist; indeed, some of the price reductions associated with the Asian Financial crisis and the price increase associated with the 2008 price spike are not included in our estimate for long-run prices. In 2008:Q4, the correlations between daily returns to crude oil and equities flip from negative to positive. We hypothesize that this flip is triggered by a large reduction in interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2008, which is associated with a reduction in convenience yields and a change from backwardation to contango in futures markets.

The current study proposes a new conceptual framework and an economic estimation model to reconcile the shadow price estimates derived via the two approaches. We also suggest a new mapping rule that incorporates the concept of abatement level, which is a basic element in the engineering approach. As a result, the proposed model generates continuously changing estimates-i.e., comprising a shadow price curve-based on the abatement level. We further investigate the determinant factors of shadow price by using second-step regression.

We apply seven averaging and one selection scheme and perform a backtesting analysis on day-ahead electricity prices in three major European and US markets. Our findings support the additional benefit of combining forecasts of individual methods for deriving more accurate predictions, however, the performance is not uniform across the considered markets and periods. In particular, equally weighted pooling of forecasts emerges as a simple, yet powerful technique compared with other schemes that rely on estimated combination weights, but only when there is no individual predictor that consistently outperforms its competitors. Constrained least squares regression (CLS) offers a balance between robustness against such well performing individual methods and relatively accurate forecasts, on average better than those of the individual predictors. Finally, some popular forecast averaging schemes - like ordinary least squares regression (015) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) - turn out to be unsuitable for predicting day-ahead electricity prices.

This paper tests the hypothesis that the lower European productivity performance in comparison with the US can be explained not only by a lower level of corporate R&D investment but also by a lower capacity to translate R&D investment into productivity gains. The proposed microeconometric estimates are based on a unique longitudinal database covering the period 1990-2008 and comprising 1,809 US and EU companies for a total of 16,079 observations. Consistent with previous literature, we find robust evidence of a significant impact of R&D on productivity; however, using different estimation techniques, the R&D coefficients for the US firms always turn out to be significantly higher. To see to what extent these transatlantic differences in the R&D/productivity relationship may be related to the different sectoral structures in the US and the EU, we differentiated the analysis by sectors. The result is that both in manufacturing, services and high-tech manufacturing sectors US firms are more able to translate their R&D investments into productivity increases.","[Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Piva, Mariacristina] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Vivarelli, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Ist Polit Econ, Inst Study Labour IZA, Sci & Technol Policy Res Unit SPRU, I-20123 Milan, Italy",University of Groningen; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Ortega-Argilés, R (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",r.ortega.argiles@rug.nl,"Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; Vivarelli, Marco/AFM-1199-2022","Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0001-8982-2163; PIVA, Mariacristina/0000-0002-3347-8946; Vivarelli, Marco/0000-0002-8746-9324; VIVARELLI, MARCO/0000-0003-0500-9461",JRC-IPTS,JRC-IPTS,Financial support and data provision from the JRC-IPTS Corporate R&D and Productivity: Econometric Tests Based on Microdata project are gratefully acknowledged.,,80,20,21,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

An important novel feature of this research is the inclusion of variables that capture social norms and personal attitudes towards tax evasion. The study concludes that expenditures on services are positively related to the financial situation of the household, the education level of household members, and the age of the household head.

In other words, a company should present favorable corporate image to enhance the trust of the customers and further induce the purchase intention and behaviors so as to enhance the sustainable management of tourism businesses. Customers' Trust is the support of tourism industry, as it satisfies the basic demands for travel guarantee and safety. Following the promotion of consumer awareness, consumers tend to purchase products or accept services from trusted tourism businesses, which therefore have to present excellent corporate image. Nevertheless, some tourism businesses have neglected Marketing Ethics in the development of market economy because of over-pursuing economic interests. When consumer sovereignty is infringed, consumer satisfaction would be reduced, resulting in declining customer loyalty. By distributing and collecting questionnaires on-site, adult tourists of Lion Travel are sampled as the research subjects. A total of 400 copies of questionnaires were distributed, in which 276 copies were valid, with the retrieval rate of 69%. SPSS is utilized for the data analyses, and Factor Analysis, Reliability Analysis, Regression Analysis, and Analysis of Variance are applied to testing various hypotheses. The research results are concluded as following. 1. Marketing Ethics presents partially positive effects on Service Process in Customer Satisfaction. 2. Marketing Ethics reveals partially positive effects on Service Structure in Customer Satisfaction. 3. Marketing Ethics shows significantly positive effects on Service Outcome in Customer Satisfaction. 4.

While predicting the future return distributions always represents the most compelling challenge in investment, any underlying distribution can be always well approximated by utilizing a mixture distribution, if we are able to ensure that the component list of a mixture distribution includes all possible distributions corresponding to the scenario analysis of potential market modes. Adopting a mixture distribution enables us to (1) reduce the problem of distribution prediction to a parameter estimation problem in which the mixture weights of a mixture distribution are estimated under a Bayesian learning scheme and the corresponding credible regions of the mixture weights are obtained as well and (2) harmonize information from different channels, such as historical data, market implied information and investors' subjective views. We further formulate a robust mean-CVaR portfolio selection problem to deal with the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future return distributions. By employing the duality theory, we show that the robust portfolio selection problem via learning with a mixture model can be reformulated as a linear program or a second-order cone program, which can be effectively solved in polynomial time. We present the results of simulation analyses and primary empirical tests to illustrate a significance of the proposed approach and demonstrate its pros and cons. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In both cases, the analysis is framed as a simple noncooperative game with a continuum of players and binary action sets. There is a unique and interior Nash equilibrium under mild network effects and two corner equilibria under strong network effects, with one club driven out. A utilitarian planner would accentuate the clustering effects of network externalities, and call for the disappearance of the minority club more often than the noncooperative solution.

Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is defined as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intradass correlation coefficient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially significant causal effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments have offered new findings on gender discrimination, and while they have identified a bias against hiring women in some labor market segments, the discrimination detected in field experiments is less pervasive than that implied by the regression approach. Experiments have also offered new insights into gender differences in preferences: women appear to gain less from negotiation, have lower preferences than men for risk and competition, and may be more sensitive to social cues. These gender differences in preferences also have implications in group settings, whereby the gender composition of a group affects team decisions and performance. Most of the evidence on gender traits comes from the lab, and key open questions remain as to the source of gender preferences-nature versus nurture, or their interaction-and their role, if any, in the workplace.

In this paper we show that competition in the insurance markets can be bad and that adverse selection is in general worse under competition than under monopoly. The reason is that monopoly can exploit its market power to relax incentive constraints by cross-subsidization between different risk types. Cream-skimming behavior, on the contrary, prevents competitive firms from using implicit transfers. In effect monopoly is shown to provide better coverage to those buying insurance but at the cost of limiting participation to insurance. Performing simulation for different distributions of risk, we find that monopoly in general performs (much) better than competition in terms of the realization of the gains from trade across all traders in equilibrium.

In particular, equation models can be effective at solving optimization problems-that is, problems concerning how an agent-based model can be most effectively steered into a particular state. In order to illustrate this strategy, we describe a modified version of the well-known SugarScape model and implement taxation. The optimization problem is to determine tax structures that minimize deaths but maximize tax income. Tax rates are dependent upon the amount of sugar available in a particular region; the rates change over time. A system of discrete difference equations is built to capture agent-based model dynamics. The equations are shown to capture the dynamics very well both with and without taxation. A multi-objective optimization technique known as Pareto optimization is then used to solve the problem. Rather than focusing on a cost function in which the two objectives are assigned weights, Pareto optimization is a heuristic method that determines a suite of solutions, each of which is optimal depending on the priorities of the researcher. In this case, Pareto optimization allows analysis of the tradeoff between taxes collected and deaths caused by taxation.

Using Breitung's (2001) non-parametric rank tests, we find the existence of linear cointegrating relationships in the consumer credit models. Enders and Siklos' (2001) threshold adjustment tests revealed that non-linearity is present slightly (with a statistical significance of 10% level) in the consumer credit model with a short-term interest rate (federal funds rate), while there exists a linear and symmetric cointegrating relationship in the models with medium (3 years) and long (10 years) term interest rates. Application of the linear cointegrating techniques (fully modified OLS, canonical cointegrating regression and general to specific) show that consumer credit responds more significantly to the medium and long-term interest rates than the short-term interest rate. We use these results to assess the popular belief that abnormality in the consumer credit set the stage for the 2007-08 crisis and severe recession. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We examine how policy outcomes depend on the sizes of the interest groups. While a larger size typically involves favorable effects on policy, we also identify threshold levels of interest-group size where a lobby will be harmed if it becomes larger. This may provide another rationale as to why some interests do not or not fully organize. Spending limits can remove adverse policy effects of interest-group size. However, this is not necessarily welfare improving. Moreover, we find that endogenous proposal making may turn a second-mover advantage in standard legislative lobbying models into a second-mover disadvantage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The author shows that the IMF has been misinformed, indeed has been misled by the Turkish authorities regarding the magnitude of public debt stock in the late 90's. The lacking information deteriorated the IMF's forecasts, which might be one of the main reasons for the failure of the IMF's planned fiscal consolidation at the outset of 2000-2001 crisis.

Our findings, after stating that the undervaluation does not go beyond the first trading day and that the intraday or secondary (open-to-close) return is significantly positive, show that intraday price variation, observed through open-to-close return variable, is not related to the offer and firm characteristics. Nevertheless, the influence of the primary market over the secondary price formation process on the first trading day is quite evident. In particular, we observe that the combination of cold and primary (offer-to-open) return variables allows us to partly explain the intraday price variation and that our results are fully consistent with the price support arguments for cold IPOs and, to a lesser degree, the cascade effect for hot IPOs.","[Acedo, Miguel A.; Ruiz-Cabestre, Francisco J.] Univ La Rioja, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Acedo, MA (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain.",,"Cabestre, Fco.

Since then, union membership in the private sector has mirrored the steep decline in manufacturing jobs. Reduced numbers means greatly reduced political clout, such that unions today exercise almost no influence on national economic policy, even at a time of deep recession. From the 1980s onward, there has been a marked shift from a Keynesian macroeconomic framework toward a monetarist and liberal market model of economic policy, such that unions are viewed by many as anti-competitive in nature and as a constraint on a free market. This has further weakened their voice on policies relating to globalization. The minimal influence of unions and the lack of other mechanisms for collective employee voice have led to a weakening of policies designed to promote employment, even at a time of high unemployment. For over a decade, there have been no formal, or even regular informal tripartite discussions on employment policy matters. Moreover, even during a Democratic administration, unions have not been given a seat at the policy table.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Bellace, J (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3730 Walnut St 672 JMHH, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bellace@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,65,1,2,0,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We argue that in many situations, the experimental intervention is competing with alternative interventions participants could conduct themselves outside the experiment. Since participants have a chance of being assigned to the control group, participating has a direct opportunity cost, which is likely to be higher for optimists. We propose a model of self-selection and show that both pessimists and optimists may opt out of the experiment, leading to an ambiguous selection bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Economic growth is desirable, not least because over 1 billion people still live in conditions of poverty. Undermining the ecological basis for human civilization will damage human welfare and further undermine economic growth. There are large adverse environmental externalities from economic activity that affect human welfare directly and indirectly through lower measured output. Finding ways to tackle these externalities will enhance wellbeing and allow continued growth of GDP while preserving aggregate natural capital. However, achieving this goal presents societies with major challenges. The composition of GDP is likely to have to change significantly, with more emphasis on new ideas and less on increased material throughputs. The role of the state in a 'green growth' transition will have to go beyond internalizing externalities to 'get prices right'. The necessary transformation will be large, system-wide, and structural, so the state must also provide, at the least, overall strategic direction. Innovation will be central to any successful strategy, as will be dealing with the distributional consequences of stronger environmental policies, particularly in developing countries. Organizing the appropriate collective action at the right levels in the face of inadequate information, while ensuring that the appropriate governance arrangements are in place, will not be easy. Policy experimentation is needed, with more rigorous ex post evaluation and, where successful, rapid dissemination of the results.","[Bowen, Alex] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] LSE, Grantham Res Inst, Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking,Oxford Smith Sch, Oxford, England; [Hepburn, Cameron] New Coll, Oxford, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Bowen, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England.",a.bowen1@lse.ac.uk; cameron.hepburn@new.ox.ac.uk,,"Hepburn, Cameron/0000-0003-0467-7441",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,57,69,72,2,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The model takes future wage risk into account and treats the direct and opportunity costs of education as additional sources of risk. In particular, the time needed to complete a degree is random. The data show that time-to-degree is substantially dispersed, conditional on the highest degree. We find significant and substantial effects of expected returns on individual education choices. The risk affecting education costs and, in particular, the randomness of time-to-degree, also plays an important role in explaining enrollment in higher education. We find precise estimates of the CRRA risk-aversion parameter, between 0.6 and 0.9. Heterogeneity in risk attitudes is significant, even in sub-populations. The sons of professionals bear more risk and are more risk averse than the rest of the sample. Yet, they study more because of higher returns and markedly lower expected investment costs.

On the other hand, we do not reject PPP. We find that PPP cointegrates with inflation differentials. We also find, contrary to conventional wisdom, that (i) equilibrium adjustment occurs between the German and UK inflation rates, while weak exogeneity exists for the German and UK interest rates and the PPP condition, and (ii) three common trends associated with the German interest rate the UK interest rate, and the PPP condition push the system with the German interest rate and the PPP condition playing dominant roles in affecting inflation in both Germany and the UK. These results cast serious doubt on the presumed independence of the UK monetary policy.","[Canarella, Giorgio; Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Pollard, Stephen K.] Trident Univ Int, Cypress, CA 90630 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",giorgio.canarella@unlv.edu; stephen.miller@unlv.edu; Stephen.Pollard@trident.edu,"Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019","Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605",,,,,90,4,5,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

But predictions are unclear when there is some trade-off between one's identity (e.g., race, gender, handedness) and potential monetary considerations. We conduct a public-goods experiment in which we permit endogenous group-formation. In a 2 x 2 design, we vary whether people participate in a team-building exercise and whether some people receive an endowment twice as much as others receive. We find that when both identity and financial considerations are present, high-endowment participants are strongly attracted to each other, with one's word-task-group affiliation eclipsed by the opportunity to earn more. Nevertheless, the team-building exercise greatly increases the level of contribution whether or not one is linked to people from one's team-building exercise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Yet many of the basic statistics and facts remain disputable. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, based on the publicly available 2000 and 2010 census data, plus some auxiliary information from other sources, we develop an accounting method to back out the scale and composition of China's urbanization. We find that urbanization accounts for 80.4% of the total urban population growth of 211 million in the 2000s. Moreover, more than half of the urbanized population, about 85.6 million, is due to rural-urban migration. Our findings suggest that rural-urban migration increased by two thirds from the 1990s to 2000s, while the population urbanized by land reclassification is roughly the same across the two periods.

In a series of experiments we study whether moral suasion affects behavior in voluntary contribution games and the mechanisms by which behavior is altered. We find that observing a message with a moral standard according to the golden rule or, alternatively, utilitarian philosophy, results in a significant but transitory increase in contributions above the levels observed for subjects that did not receive a message or received a message that advised them to contribute without a moral rationale. When players have the option of punishing each other after the contribution stage, the effect of the moral messages on contributions becomes persistent: punishments and moral messages interact to sustain cooperation. We also investigate the mechanisms through which moral suasion operates and find that it affects both expectations and preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Within a multi-country model where energy is produced with mobile capital in green and dirty production, we investigate the countries' decentralized choice of emissions taxes and green energy subsidies. Without green subsidies, the emissions tax is set inefficiently low, since each country ignores the environmental externality inflicted on other countries and since the emissions tax leads to a capital outflow to other countries. When the green subsidy is available, countries choose a positive subsidy rate since this reduces the overall distortion of the tax-subsidy system. In doing so, each country internalizes a larger part of the environmental externality. As a consequence capital is relocated from the dirty into the clean sectors and reduces global pollution. Hence, the subsidy is not only beneficial for the country which imposes it but also for all countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has shown that the risk of political extraction by politicians and bureaucrats in countries with weak institutions has an adverse effect on holdings of liquid assets. We propose that political participation by private entrepreneurs can function as a means to alleviate some of that risk. We find that political participation in China is positively related to cash holdings in regions with weaker institutions. Our results also show that investments in hard assets such as PPE and inventories, which are less susceptible to the grabbing hand, are higher in regions with weaker institutions, but that political participation mitigates this effect. Finally, cash holdings have an insignificantly positive effect on firm value on its own, while political participation is positively associated with firm value. The interaction between cash holdings and political participation is positively related to firm value, again suggesting that political participation facilitates the holding of liquid assets in China, which in turn results in better firm performance.

We estimate both own- and cross-price elasticities and Morishima elasticities of substitution between capital, labour, materials and energy. We find that capital and energy are substitutes in the production process. Across all firms we find that a 1% rise in the price of energy is associated with an increase of 0.04% in the demand for capital. The Morishima elasticities, which reflect the technological substitution potential, indicate that a 1% increase in the price of energy causes the capital/energy input ratio to increase by 1.5%. The demand for capital in energy-intensive firms is more responsive to increases in energy prices, while it is less responsive in foreignowned firms.

This well-documented phenomenon is termed status quo bias. We present the probabilistic dominance approach to status quo bias: an alternative is considered acceptable to replace the status quo only if the chances of a (subjectively) severe loss, relative to the status quo, are not too high. Probabilistic dominance is applied and behaviorally characterized in a choice model that allows for a range of status quo biases, general enough to accommodate unanimity, but also standard expected utility maximization. We present a comparative notion of revealing more bias towards the status quo and study its implications to the probabilistic dominance model of choice. Lastly, the model is applied to the endowment effect phenomenon and to a problem of international portfolio choice when investors are home biased. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The first - ecological holism - requires that management of natural systems not only ensure the long term viability of ecosystem functions and enhanced diversity of wildlife within that ecosystem, but also facilitate the provision of renewable energy and material resources. The second - community centeredness - is an assessment of the improvement (or reduction) in economic wellbeing of local populations measured by employment and income and in quality of life for the larger community resulting from that policy. The third - institutional legitimacy - evaluates the level of justice that a policy and its outcome(s) bring to the entire community (here, just policies will satisfy Rawls's veil of ignorance test). Three policies for National Forest management on Washington's Olympic Peninsula are examined and results are compared: the Northwest Forest Plan, the Wild Olympics Wilderness and Scenic Rivers Act of 2012 (Wild Olympics), and The Third Way (an alternative forest management option). Each policy satisfies the first test of ecological holism, but not in equal measures. Success in this regard can be differentially ranked because the relative impacts are not neutral. Both the Northwest Forest Plan and Wild Olympics fail the test of community centeredness. In contrast, The Third Way promotes community centeredness and ecological holism. We assert that, as a result, it would satisfy John Rawls's test for justice, and it is institutionally legitimate.","[Underwood, Daniel A.] Peninsula Coll, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA; [Underwood, Daniel A.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Friesner, Dan] N Dakota State Univ, Fargo, ND USA; [Friesner, Dan] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Cross, Jason] Univ Washington, Olymp Nat Resources Center, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; North Dakota State University Fargo; Washington State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Underwood, DA (通讯作者)，Peninsula Coll, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA.",,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,35,5,5,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In order to identify the impact of property rights, I consider a country-wide land certification program that took place in Mexico in the 1990s. My identification strategy exploits the staggered implementation and the households' eligibility for the program. I find that the program increased the eligible households' likelihood of having one or more members abroad by 12%. In terms of the number of migrants, my coefficient estimates explain 26% of the 1994-1997 increase in migrants from ejido areas and 13-15% of the increase from all of Mexico. Consistent with our theoretical model, the impact is strongest for households without a land will. This implies that land inheritance issues drive at least part of the effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Firms can either be multinationals and serve the foreign market through a fully controlled affiliate, or be exporters and serve the foreign market by contracting with an independent distributor. The use of the OECD's comparable uncontrolled transfer price (CUP) rule distorts firms' output and pricing decisions, because the comparable arm's length transactions between exporters and distributors-which serve as the benchmark-are not efficient. We show that the CUP rule is detrimental to consumers in the low-tax country, yet benefits consumers in the high-tax country when compared to the benchmark of unconstrained profit shifting. Using the OECD rule increases tax revenue at the expense of consumer surplus. Those results also hold under the alternative cost-plus transfer pricing rule.","[Behrens, Kristian] Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Peralt, Susana] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Peralt, Susana; Picard, Pierre M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Peralt, Susana] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Picard, Pierre M.] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, Walferdange, Luxembourg",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universite Catholique Louvain; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Luxembourg,"Behrens, K (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",behrens.kristian@uqam.ca; per-alta@novasbe.pt; pierre.picard@uni.lu,,"peralta, susana/0000-0002-3516-2339",,,,,36,7,9,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Positive (negative) development in house prices fuels optimism (pessimism) and credit expansion (contraction), which in turn boost (dampen) housing demand and house prices and reinforce agents' optimism (pessimism). Bayesian learning about house prices can endogenously generate self-reinforcing booms and busts in house prices and significantly strengthen the role of collateral constraints in aggregate fluctuations. The model can quantitatively account for the 2001-2008 U.S. boom-bust cycle in house prices and associated household debt and consumption dynamics. It also demonstrates that allowing for imperfect knowledge of agents, a higher leveraged economy is more prone to self-reinforcing fluctuations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a structural equation modeling approach based on the method of Partial Least Squares, a confirmatory test of the model construct validity was performed, including behavioral beliefs and normative beliefs. The results obtained from 7480 Italian young adults revealed that the theory of reasoned action had predictive power for the intention of buying longevity annuities. The cause-effect relationship of behavioral and normative beliefs was confirmed. Intention to purchase a longevity annuity was determined to be affected by both attitude toward buying and the subjective norm with a greater influence of social pressure over attitude. Finally, results showed that intention to buy longevity annuity policies was significantly moderated by three background factors, namely, gender, annual household income, and educational attainment.

This article examines the price of interest activities and noninterest activities of Chinese commercial banks over 2000-2010 based on OLS and 2SLS regression. We find that the price of interest activities has a significant negative effect on the noninterest activities. It appears that controlled interest rate is the main hindrance of the development of noninterest activities, and the result is consistent with 'political' view. We also find that among state-owned commercial banks and nonstate-owned ones, the relationships of interest activities and noninterest activities are differential. The link between the price of interest activities and noninterest activities in state-owned commercial banks is stronger than that in nonstate-owned commercial banks. That is the result of different government intervention degree.","[Cheng, Maoyong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, SN, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Junrui] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, SN, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Zhao, H (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, SN, Peoples R China.",zhaored@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,10,10,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The nested logit estimates support the follow-the-leader hypothesis. The network among FDI firms, backward linkage relationship with local upstream firms, and business service agglomeration are the main determinants of FDI location. Our estimation results suggest the possibility of a circular causality between the attractive force of backward agglomeration and the knowledge spillover of FDI, which brings in the geographical concentration of economic activities within a region. In addition, we find quite different location patterns between high- and low-tech industry groups. Reflecting the characteristics of the industry, whereas the centripetal force of foreign agglomeration increases gradually in the high-tech industry, it decreases gradually with the size of agglomeration in the low-tech industry. Furthermore, while regional gap of the labor cost matters in the location decision of low-tech firms, the regional quality of labor matters for the high-tech firms.","[Lee, Ki-Dong] Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Taegu, South Korea; [Hwang, Seok-Joon] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Taegu, South Korea",Keimyung University; Kyungpook National University,"Hwang, SJ (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Taegu, South Korea.",sxh219@knu.ac.kr,"Hwang, Seok-Joon/R-6225-2019; Lee, Ki-Dong/L-4195-2017","Lee, Ki-Dong/0000-0002-2660-2806",,,,,44,12,12,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We show that this simple framework is capable of producing a countercyclical finance premium, while matching the well-documented stylized facts of macro dynamics. A key feature is the endogenous derivation of the default probability from break-even conditions, which results in the loan rate being set as a countercyclical finance premium over the cost of borrowing from the central bank. The latter is shown to provide an accelerator effect through which shocks can amplify the loan spread and the dynamic response of macro variables.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard; Bratsiotis, George J.] Univ Manchester, Oxford M13 9PL, England; [Agenor, Pierre-Richard; Bratsiotis, George J.] Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Pfajfar, Damjan] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; Tilburg University,"Bratsiotis, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Oxford M13 9PL, England.",george.j.bratsiotis@manchester.ac.uk,,"Bratsiotis, George John/0000-0001-8740-6254",,,,,22,15,15,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Moreover, our data also allow us to analyze whether youths' and/or mothers' expectations predict schooling decisions, and whether this depends on the age and gender of the youth. In particular, we use Mexican data that contain labor market expectations of mothers and youths. We find that expected returns and risk perceptions are important determinants of schooling decisions, the latter in particular from the perspective of the mother. Boys' expectations predict the decision to enter college, but not to enter high school. While girls' own expectations do not predict either of the two educational decisions, mothers' expectations are particularly strong predictors of their daughters' decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The simple structure of the model allows for closed-form solutions. The set-up differs from the related literature in that I assume wages are sticky and unions are responsible for wage-setting. The model has the potential to explain why wages depend strongly on past wage levels as it is suggested by empirical data. The presence of efficiency wages increases persistence, however, only for certain parameter constellations. In particular, the elasticity of effort with respect to the wage has to be large.

As a result, modeling electricity prices requires accounting for both long-term and periodic components. In the literature, several filtering procedures have been proposed but a standard has not yet been found. Furthermore, since different procedures are applied in contexts that are not homogeneous with respect to data, periods and final goals, a fair comparison is difficult. This work considers several methods for component estimation in a homogeneous framework and compares them according to specific criteria.

The method proposed is labelled the genetic approach, as it is inspired by population genetics: as geneticists are interested in studying patterns of migration and therefore the common origins of people, in innovation studies we are interested in tracing the origin and the evolution of today knowledge. In the context of patent and citation networks, this is done by calculating the patent's persistence index, i.e., decomposing patent's knowledge applying the Mendelian law of gene inheritance. This draws on the idea that the more a patent is related (through citations) to descendent patents, the more it affects future technological development and therefore its contribution persists in the technology. Results show that the method proposed is successful in reducing the number of both nodes and links considered. Furthermore, our method is indeed successful in identifying technological discontinuities where previous knowledge is not relevant for current technological development.","[Martinelli, Arianna] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Nomaler, Onder] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Martinelli, A (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Piazza Martiri Libert 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",a.martinelli@sssup.it,,"MARTINELLI, Arianna/0000-0002-5425-1038",,,,,37,42,45,0,69,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We show experimentally that in all interactions control mechanisms can have hidden costs for reasons specific to group membership. In within-group interactions control has detrimental effects because the agent does not expect to be controlled and reacts negatively when being controlled. In between-group interactions, agents perceive control more hostile once we condition on their beliefs about principals' behavior.

This paper has two objectives: (1) to formally describe how quantity uncertainty is likely to affect consumer behavior and (2) to describe how these changes in behavior are likely to differ depending on how the quantity uncertain good is priced. We develop a theoretical model of consumer behavior under quantity uncertainty which we use to illustrate how different price structures and different locations within price structures matter for how information impacts behavior. We test these hypotheses using a unique panel data set containing information on water consumption habits of more than 88,000 households in the City of Aurora, Colorado. In 2005, Aurora subsidized the purchase of electronic devices for households to monitor water use. These devices provide households with real-time information on their water use. We find that, consistent with the aims of the program, households with the device decreased their water use during periods when they faced a constantmarginal price; however, contrary to the aims of the program, their consumption increased during periods when they faced an increasing block rate pricing structure. These results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model developed herein.","[Strong, Aaron] Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Goemans, Chris] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Iowa; Colorado State University,"Strong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Publ Policy Ctr, 200 S Quad, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",aaron-strong@uiowa.edu; chris.goemans@colostate.edu,,"Goemans, Christopher/0000-0003-4930-4278",,,,,14,3,3,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Although many different works have dealt with the analysis of the existence of a real estate wealth effect, most of them as a reaction to the dramatic increase of housing prices in several OECD countries, there are only few papers analysing whether the consumption response depends on the positive or negative sign of the wealth shock and, as far as we know, none of them takes the effects of credit market conditions on that asymmetric response into account. This article tries to fill the existing gap in the literature on this matter. From an econometric perspective, we estimate the asymmetries in the consumption response within the momentum threshold autoregressive model (M-TAR) proposed by Enders and Siklos (2001), but following Stevans (2004), it is applied to a multivariate framework. The main results show that the credit market conditions play a significant role in the transmission of changes in real estate wealth to consumption. In addition, we find that there exists an asymmetric behaviour in the US aggregate consumption spending responses to real estate wealth and credit market shocks, which is only significant when a negative shock takes place.","[Marquez, E.; Martinez-Canete, A.

Moreover, plant-level materials prices are persistent, spatially correlated, and positively associated with the probability of exit. The contribution of entry and exit to aggregate productivity growth is smaller for productivity measures that are purged of materials price variation. After documenting these patterns, I discuss three potential sources of materials price variation: geography, differences in suppliers' marginal costs, and within-supplier markup differences.

I find that the secular rise in the employment of cognitive skills is largely accounted for by labour force composition changes in shares of gender-education groups rather than changes that occur within these groups. Average employed skills differ greatly across groups, but over time their average employed cognitive skills have remained approximately constant. Returns to cognitive skills increased very sharply for high skill levels, more gradually around mean levels, and decreased at low levels. Returns to physical skills generally declined. These trends account for approximately 63% of the increase in the college wage premium, with changes in returns to cognitive skills playing a dominant role. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is feasible to exclude group members, to exit one's group, or to form larger groups through mergers involving the consent of both merging groups. We find a great degree of success for this mechanism, as the average contribution rate is very high. The driving force appears to be the economies of scale combined with the awareness that bad behavior will result in exclusion or no admission. However, an important additional component is that it is possible for previous outsiders to later redeem themselves by becoming high contributors, typically in efficient large groups.

We construct a new diversification measure, taking systematic risk of different sectors into consideration by weighting them with their betas and compare the results with those of more conventional measure HHI. We find that sectorial diversification is associated with reduced return and also decreased risk at the same time, which however, contradicts existing findings in developed countries such as Italy and Germany, and also in emerging economies such as Brazil and Argentina. Our analysis also provides important implication for regulators and policy makers of the banks in emerging markets.","[Chen, Yibing; Shi, Yong; Wei, Xianhua; Zhang, Lingling] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yibing; Wei, Xianhua; Zhang, Lingling] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yong] Univ Nebraska, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Nebraska System","Shi, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Fictitious Econ & Data Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",yshi@ucas.ac.cn,"zhang, lingling/HDM-2189-2022",,,,,,33,15,16,1,30,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

While the rise of this 'gig' economy is praised by some as a response to the wishes of a more entrepreneurial generation, it is more likely that it is driven by the concerns of businesses to lower wages and benefit costs during business down-turns while also reducing their vulnerability to unfair dismissal lawsuits.

An analysis based on a DSGE model with banking,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,DSGE; Monetary policy; Asset prices; Credit channel; Taylor rule; Leaning-against-the-wind,,"The global financial crisis has reaffirmed the importance of financial factors for macroeconomic fluctuations. Recent work has shown how the conventional pre-crisis prescription that monetary policy should pay no attention to financial variables over and above their effects on inflation may no longer be valid in models that consider frictions in financial intermediation (Curdia and Woodford, 2009). This paper analyzes whether Taylor rules augmented with asset prices and credit can improve upon a standard rule both in terms of macroeconomic stabilization and of agents' welfare in a DSGE with both a firms' balance-sheet channel and a bank-lending channel and in which the spread between lending and policy rates endogenously depends on banks' leverage. The main result is that, even in a model in which financial stability does not represent a distinctive policy objective, leaning-against-the-wind policies are desirable in the case of supply side shocks, while strict inflation targeting and a standard rule are less effective. The gains are amplified if the economy is characterized by high private sector indebtedness. Robustness shows that the interaction between financial frictions and debt-deflation effects is potentially very powerful. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The overall results for the full sample period, 1950-2010, and two subsample periods, 1970-2010 and 1993-2010, suggest that Australia's high inflation persistence does not incorporate a unit root, with the post-1993 analysis most emphatically yielding the result. High inflation persistence and volatility in Australia suggest that inflationary shock takes a long time to dissipate but does not permanently alter the low average level of inflation.

While the modeling issues, effects on parameter estimation, and, to a lesser degree, causes of ANA have been the main concern of research in this area, to date few studies have produced generalizable results about the effects of ANA on parameter estimates and little attention has been paid to the efficiency of experimental design in the face of ANA. This paper looks at these issues and also introduces a distinction between random and systematic ANA, which is defined to be ANA that is persistent in the face of choice task and/or attribute order randomization. As part of this study, Monte Carlo simulations are run to examine the effects of ANA on parameter estimation, under the conditions of random and systematic ANA. Simulations with respondent heterogeneity are also carried out to test the efficiency of latent class model estimations. The models perform well, but it is argued that the underlying assumption of serial ANA is indistinguishable from zero preferences with respondent heterogeneity, and such ANA is inconsequential to the choice made (i.e. the same choice is made whether or not the attribute is being attended to). In contrast, when a non-zero preference attribute is ignored, the latent model does not pick up the effects of ANA and additional data is required. Not incorporating ANA data significantly biases estimates of all parameters, especially when the marginal effects of the ignored attribute are relatively large. Finally, it is shown that orthogonal design is significantly disturbed by systematic ANA, and there is scope to improve it by using a D-efficient design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our principal finding is that banks with larger gross positions in credit derivatives charge significantly lower corporate loan spreads, while banks' net positions are not consistently related to loan pricing. We argue that this is consistent with banks passing on risk management benefits to corporate borrowers but not with alternative channels through which credit derivative use may affect loan pricing. We also find that the magnitude of the risk management effect remained unchanged during the crisis period of 2007-2009. In addition, banks with larger gross positions in credit derivatives cut their lending by less than other banks during the crisis and have consistently lower loan charge-offs. In sum, our study is suggestive of significant risk management benefits from financial innovations that persist under adverse conditions that is, when they matter most. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this environment, an increase in reputation above a certain threshold always makes truthful revelation more difficult to achieve, since experts with greater reputation can more easily sway the beliefs of decision makers in a desired direction. Thus, higher levels of reputation exacerbate the incentives of biased experts to misreport their private information.

But they do not know if Mexicans care about air pollution or they prefer that government faces other problems. This paper answers this question and in fact, we conclude that Mexicans do care about air pollution (measured by Particulate Matter) and they agree to pay to reduce it. This paper follows a residential sorting model to calculate marginal willingness to pay for a reduction in air pollution. Our estimates imply that the household head in Mexico would pay $443.66 to $2,682.92 (in constant 2000 Mexican pesos) or 46.90-283.61 (2000 dollars) for a one-unit reduction in Particulate Matter emissions per year. Therefore, there are benefits to reduce this problem in Mexico and the government and private firms must face this problem since the costs are lower than those benefits.","[Ivan Rodriguez-Sanchez, Jose] Univ Tecnol Mixteca, Inst Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Huajuapan De Leon 69000, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Ivan Rodriguez-Sanchez, Jose] Univ Americas Puebla, Dept Econ, Cholula 72810, Mexico",Universidad Americas Puebla (UDLAP),"Rodríguez-Sánchez, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Tecnol Mixteca, Inst Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Carretera Acatlima Km 2-5, Huajuapan De Leon 69000, Oaxaca, Mexico.",rodrigji@colorado.edu,,,,,,,23,8,9,0,15,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

And not surprisingly, the impending normalization of monetary conditions has created expectations of a likely reversal in commodity price trends. Based on a reduced form, price-determination model which accounts for all quantifiable sectoral and macroeconomic fundamentals, this note finds that the effect of short-term interest rates on metal prices is mixed and modest. But, changes in longer term rates have a positive and highly significant impact.

The number of references for business networks is more limited, but they are also related with a reduction on information costs. In this article we investigate whether such a relation holds also for Spanish domestic trade flows in consumer services. To this end, we use a gravity model rooted in the Dixit-Stiglitz-Krugman theoretical framework and a unique data set on interregional trade flows for some of the main tourism service sectors, namely, accommodations and restaurants. Our industry-specific analysis finds a large positive effect for restaurants but a more limited effect for accommodations. Forces driving the demand in each sector explain this result and suggest the idea that although social networks can act as a substitute of firms in some sectors at the same time they can enhance trade flows in other sectors. We perform the same kind of analysis with a data set (obtained by a similar method) for domestic trade in goods and discover a different response to social and business networks. Finally, we treat the potential endogeneity by taking the instrumental-variable approach of the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator and thus obtain consistent results.","[de la Mata, Tamara] IESE Business Sch, Strateg Management Dept, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [de la Mata, Tamara] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Inst LR Klein CEPREDE, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School; Autonomous University of Madrid,"de la Mata, T (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Strateg Management Dept, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",tamara.delamata@uam.es,"de la Mata, Tamara/M-1626-2014",,,,,,24,3,3,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This study is motivated by the take-it-or-leave-it second chance offer rules used by eBay and a number of state procurement agencies. Equilibrium bidder behavior is determined for IPV sealed bid first price, second price, English, and Vickrey auctions when a second chance offer will be made with an exogenous probability p. In all but the Vickrey auction (which elicits the dominant strategy of bidding one's value) equilibrium bids are lower than if there were no possibility of a second chance offer and higher than if a second chance offer will be made for certain. Further, the possibility of a second chance offer erodes the strategic equivalence between second price bids and English auction drop out levels. If bidders are risk averse (with CRRA preferences), this difference leads to expected revenue dominance of the second price over the English auction, both of which dominate the Vickrey auction. The first price auction is also shown to revenue dominate the Vickrey auction, and moreover, numerical results and intuition from existing literature suggest that the first price auction revenue dominates the second price auction.","[Bagchi, Aniruddha; Katzman, Brett; Mathews, Timothy] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Mathews, T (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, 1000 Chastain Rd, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",abagchi@kennesaw.edu; bkatzman@kennesaw.edu; tmmathews@gmail.com,"Bagchi, Aniruddha/A-8641-2009","Bagchi, Aniruddha/0000-0002-7553-4053",,,,,15,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Here we investigate how developments of sociology, social history, socio-economics and economic psychology have not been able to exit from the terms of that problem.","[Dixon, William; Wilson, David] London Metropolitan Univ, London EC2M 6SQ, England",London Metropolitan University,"Dixon, W (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, Econ Subject Area, 84 Moorgate, London EC2M 6SQ, England.",william.dixon54@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,5,5,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The FPA is known to be more profitable than the SPA if the strong bidder's distribution function is convex and the weak bidder's distribution is obtained by truncating or horizontally shifting the former. In this paper, I employ a new mechanism design result to show that the FPA remains optimal if the weak bidder's distribution falls between the two benchmarks in a natural way. The same conclusion holds if the strong bidder's distribution is concave, but with a vertical shift replacing the horizontal shift. A result with a similar flavor holds if the strong bidder's distribution is neither convex nor concave. The dispersive order and the star order prove useful in comparing the weak bidder's distribution to the benchmarks. A key step establishes a relationship between these orders and reverse hazard rate dominance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The more developed the host country is in terms of its economic or institutional development relative to the MNE's country of origin (COO), the greater such liabilities that the MNE is expected to face. We posit that the varying degrees of the LOR influence the extent to which MNEs from emerging countries rely on the parent country nationals (PCNs) in the management of subsidiaries. We also hypothesize that the effects of the length of subsidiary operation and the intangibility of the proprietary assets on the expatriate assignment are moderated by the host country level of development.

Thus, we consider the Condorcet set: the set of logically consistent views which agree with the majority on a maximal subset of issues. The elements of this set turn out to be exactly those that can be obtained through sequential majority voting, according to which issues are sequentially decided by simple majority unless earlier choices logically force the opposite decision. We investigate the size and structure of the Condorcet set for several important classes of judgement aggregation problems.

Policymakers have placed a clear focus on SEA stock markets as a primary driver of regional economic growth. However, it is questionable whether SEA is ready for such an ambitious economic initiative, particularly given the reported negative effects of lesser developed stock markets. Despite these negative implications, the benefits appear to outweigh the costs for SEA stock markets. It is perceived that SEA stock markets will drive further economic reform, financial liberalisation, and market integration, promising tremendous benefits for both the region and the international investment community.

This paper documents evidence of size clustering behavior in the European Carbon Futures Market and analyzes the circumstances under which it happens. Our findings show that carbon trades are concentrated in sizes of one to five contracts and in multiples of five. We have also demonstrated that more clustered prices have more clustered sizes, suggesting that price and size resolution in the European Carbon Market are complementary and that carbon traders round both the price and the size of their orders. Finally, the analysis of the key determinants of the size clustering reveals that traders use a reduced number of different trade sizes when uncertainty is high, market liquidity is poor, and the desire to open new positions and cancel old ones is very strong.

Insecurity estimates based on pre-government incomes are highest in Britain and lowest in Germany, however results for post-government incomes are highest in the U.S. It is also shown that insecurity estimates based upon pre-government incomes are heavily concentrated at the lower end of the distribution; although governments are effective at smoothing the income streams of these households. We also search for determinants of our measure and find that gender, household size, health status, and industry affiliations of the household head are the most significant covariates.","[Rohde, Nicholas] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Tang, Kam Ki; Rao, D.

We define sustainability as the validity of the inter-temporal budget constraint of the government and test a sufficient condition motivated by Bohn (Q J Econ, 113(3):949-963, 1998) using single-country and pooled regressions. We find evidence that the Euro Convergence Criteria contributed to the sustainability of debt accumulation. Further, while the yield spreads suggest the debt crisis is a problem of the southern Euro countries, we find a lack of debt sustainability for Greece, Portugal and France but not for Italy and Spain. In terms of debt sustainability, the crisis adversely affected primarily stand-alone countries rather than members of the European Monetary Union. Nevertheless, yield spreads increased more in the southern countries of the monetary union than in stand-alone countries. Our results support the view that countries within a monetary union are more prone to investors' sentiments than stand-alone countries.","Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Schoder, C (通讯作者)，Macroecon Policy Inst IMK, Hans Bockler Str 39, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany.",christian-schoder@boeckler.de,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2014,41.0,2,,,SI,,247,271,,10.1007/s10663-013-9210-6,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AG6UT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335554700006,0

We extend the growth equation by incorporating corporate social responsibility (CSR) variables and a dummy variable to measure the impact of government CSR-supporting policies. We find that CSR firms are important for economic growth (positively affect growth) and that countries that strongly support CSR achieve higher growth rates. Specifically, countries without an organized and supportive CSR environment and guidelines can hardly expect to increase economy performance through the new growth channels generated by CSR companies (new markets and customers). It is thus important to investigate how CSR companies affect economic growth towards reconsideration of the government's role in CSR promotion as a means to boost economic growth.

The highly persistent variable is specified as a nearly stationary persistent process. Such a process appears to be particularly well suited to characterize the dynamics of hours worked because it implies a unit root in a finite sample but is asymptotically stationary and persistent.

This study identifies two mechanisms through which sectoral diversification and exchange rate regime choice may be related, namely the external shock absorption and rent-seeking mechanisms. A direct effect of diversification on regime choice is also hypothesized. Using a panel dataset covering 91 countries over the period 1985-2006, the paper runs a 'horse race' among these potential channels. The results show that diversification is associated with flexible regimes in countries experiencing greater external shocks. Additionally, countries characterized by higher levels of corruption and lower levels of diversification opt for fixed regimes, suggesting that a fixed regime may shield the powerful elites from international competition. There is also weak evidence of the direct effect of diversification in adopting flexible regimes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike existing studies, governments are assumed to decide not only tax rates but also whether they are set early or late. The Nash equilibrium provides four conclusions for alternative double tax allowances. First, tax deductions cause simultaneous tax competition, whereas tax credits yield sequential tax competition. Second, any double taxation relief would generate capital trade. Third, a credit system could maximize one country's economic welfare but would lower another country's economic welfare more than a deduction regime. Fourth, a home country's government would choose credit regimes under a maximax rule, but select deduction methods under minimax and maximin rules, while all double tax allowances are indifferent to a host country. The findings resolve the question raised by Bond and Samuelson (Economic Journal 99:1099-1111, 1989) of why governments choose tax credits when tax deductions are clearly better. Namely, this paper shows that one country is better off but another is worse off with credits rather than deductions. Accordingly, we cannot clearly specify whether governments choose credit systems or deduction regimes. The possible double tax allowances employed by the governments depend on their own decision criterion.","Oita Univ, Oita 8701192, Japan",Oita University,"Ida, T (通讯作者)，Oita Univ, 700 Dannoharu, Oita 8701192, Japan.",ida@oita-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Feinberg and Husted (2011) have shown that this enforcement, especially nonhorizontal cases, may be viewed by potential entrants as a negative aspect of the state business climate. However, they did not pursue a more disaggregate analysis of small firm entry behaviour; nor did they investigate different responses between manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing firms. Another related issue is the extent to which state cases filed in tandem with federal investigations have the same impact on establishment entry as do purely independent' cases. These considerations are dealt with in this article. The author uses annual state-level data from the Statistics of US Business to examine entry and relocation reactions to state antitrust enforcement by firms within three small-business categories: 1-19 employees; 20-99 employees; 100-499 employees. Generally speaking, the smallest retail and wholesale firms seem to favour vigorous antitrust activity, especially enforcement targeted against cartel behaviour by suppliers. The largest small-firm retailers and wholesalers (those with 100-499 employees) seem somewhat threatened by such activity, especially the more controversial nonhorizontal enforcement.

I adopt a multivariate GARCH model that allows the conditional correlation between carbon, energy and financial prices to change smoothly across regimes governed by functions of two transition variables that explain why price linkages vary. I use (i) time as transition variable to allow for structural changes associated with institutional advances in the EU ETS and (ii) implied volatility to account for heterogeneity in the behaviour of correlations in times of distress compared to calm periods. The results point to a new pricing regime with much closer carbon-energy price linkages in the second phase of the EU ETS. Furthermore, I find that correlations depend on market uncertainty conditions, which exposes the link between carbon and financial markets due to common macroeconomic shocks during the current financial crisis.","[Koch, Nicolas] Univ Hamburg, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Koch, N (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",koch@mcc-berlin.net,,"Koch, Nicolas/0000-0002-7775-034X",,,,,58,47,50,4,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

CACs are assessed security by security. Using a panel data approach, we find a U-shaped effect of CACs on yields according to the credit rating of the issuer. While the impact is negligible for the highest ratings, a significant yield discount emerges for mid-range ratings, which is smaller for bad ratings and possibly insignificant for the worst ratings. This relationship appears fairly robust across a number of checks. This evidence may reflect the fact that CACs are valuable because they help with orderly restructuring unless the perceived probability of default is too small. Nevertheless, at low ratings, this effect can be weakened by an increasing risk of moral hazard. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model of uncertainty averse preferences that is based on a mean and a measure of the dispersion of the state-wise utility of an act. The dispersion measure exhibits positive linear homogeneity, sub-additivity, translation invariance and complementary symmetry. Since preferences are only weakly separable in terms of these two summary statistics, the uncertainty premium need not be constant. We generalize the concept of decreasing absolute risk aversion.

Instead, a better comparison takes into account the costs of trade. This paper shows first, in an example, how trade patterns can vary with costs of trade. It then provides restatements of the law of comparative advantage, first in a Ricardian model with trade costs, then extending a 1980 result due to Deardorff and to Dixit and Norman to include trade costs explicitly in a general framework. It uses this latter result to derive two correlations relating trade patterns to measures of comparative advantage that take account of both autarky prices and the costs of trade. Finally, the paper examines the solution to a trade model with product differentiation in order to make the potential role of trade costs more explicit, both algebraically and graphically. With product differentiation either by country or by firm, net trade in an industry, both bilaterally and globally, depends on a country's costs of both production and trade relative to an index of those costs for other countries.","Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Deardorff, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",alandear@umich.edu,,"Deardorff, Alan V/0000-0002-4954-7520",,,,,29,23,31,4,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

When platforms charge consumers fixed access fees, all equilibrium levels of search diversion under platform competition are equal to the monopoly level, irrespective of the nature of competition.

Using two cross-sections from the 2002-2003 and 2009-2010 Spanish Time Use Surveys, we find that higher regional unemployment rates are associated with increases in the time devoted to study by men. Regional unemployment rates are also associated with more time devoted to household production, particularly for unemployed men and women living in a couple, and to less time devoted to leisure, particularly for unemployed men with a working partner and unemployed women not living in a couple. We interpret our findings as evidence favoring consumption smoothing. Higher regional unemployment rates imply a lower availability of jobs for the unemployed, it reduces individual expectations of finding a job, and thus households may try to increase their time spent on household production to reduce market expenditures and thus maintain their consumption constant. Increases in the time devoted to household production during business cycles need to be considered in the analysis of the wellbeing of the unemployed.

Data from 213 Korean firms for the years 1985 to 2007 are used, and the number of patent applications is used as a proxy variable for knowledge. The results show that all the growth rates of output, patents, and productivity are higher in high-technology firms. Regression results show that the spillover effect on knowledge production and productivity growth is very significant, and that the spillover effect is larger in small firms than in large firms. Moreover, spillover effects on productivity growth are larger after 1995, when Korean intellectual property rights were strengthened. Our findings suggest that the effects of knowledge spillover on productivity are positively correlated with strong intellectual property rights.","[Kim, Taegi] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Kwangju 500757, South Korea; [Maskus, Keith] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Oh, Keun-Yeob] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taejon 305764, South Korea",Chonnam National University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Chungnam National University,"Oh, KY (通讯作者)，Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taejon 305764, South Korea.",kyoh@cnu.ac.kr,,"Oh, Keunyeob/0000-0001-6553-9021",,,,,20,6,7,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Endogenizing financial knowledge has important implications for welfare, as well as policies intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge in the larger population. Next, we draw on recent surveys to establish how much (or how little) people know and identify the least financially savvy population subgroups. This is followed by an examination of the impact of financial literacy on economic decision making in the United States and elsewhere. While the literature is still young, conclusions may be drawn about the effects and consequences of financial illiteracy and what works to remedy these gaps.

China as the world's biggest food producer has the fastest growing share of fish and shellfish exports to these countries. While there have been an increasing number of studies conducted on consumer demand for various food product attributes, little research has been focused on producer behavior, and studies on Chinese food producers are especially absent in the literature. The objective of this study is to assess Chinese aquaculture producers' willingness-to-change (WTC) and adopt certain production practices related to food safety. Producer preferences for enhanced food safety measures, and sustainable/eco-friendly production practices are assessed using a choice experiment Primary data was collected in the leading aquaculture producing provinces of southern China. The average net income per farmer of our sample was 81,286 RMB/year of which approximately 72% originated from their aquaculture operation. Derived WTC estimates from a random parameters logit model suggest that the representative Chinese producer would require a 2.49% premium per fin of fish to adopt enhanced food safety practices such as those required for China GAP, and No Public Harm voluntary certifications and they would accept a 3.22% discount before being indifferent between having an antibiotic-free facility and using antibiotics. WTC estimates of sustainable eco-friendly practices and verification by various entities were also assessed. A latent class model (LCM) is used to segregate producers into group with similar underlying characteristics to develop policies to improve producer practices and ultimately product safety and quality.

It uses a dynamic general equilibrium model which highlights the mechanisms of endogenous growth and includes a detailed modeling of the public sector. Fuel price scenarios are based on forecasts by the US Department of Energy (DOE-US), the International Energy Agency (IEA-OECD) and IHS Global Insight Inc. The differences in relative fuel prices among the three scenarios lead to substantially different environmental impacts. Higher fuel prices in the DOE-US scenario lead to a 10.2% reduction in the policy effort required to meet the EU 2020 emission targets, while relative price changes in the IEA-OECD scenario result in a 19.2% increase in the required policy effort and decreasing fuel prices increase the emissions deficit by 95.9% under the IHS scenario. In terms of the long term economic impacts, our results suggest a 2.2% reduction in GDP in the DOE-US scenario and 1.9% in the IEA-OECD scenario and an increase of 1.4% in the IHS scenario. As to the budgetary impact, higher fuel prices lead to lower tax revenues, which, coupled with a reduction in public spending translates to lower public deficits. From a methodological perspective, our results highlight the importance of the mechanisms of endogenous growth. A scenario of higher fuel prices would, under exogenous economic growth assumptions, result in larger baseline emissions growth, substantially smaller economic effects, and rather different budgetary effects. From a policy perspective, our results highlight the importance of fossil fuel prices in defining the level of policy intervention required for compliance with international and domestic climate change legislation.

The theoretical justification for our solution is based on multivariate statistical analysis of multidimensional investment tasks, particularly on relations between data size, algorithm complexity and portfolio efficacy. To reduce the dimensionality/sample size problem, a larger task is broken down into smaller parts by means of item similarity clustering. Similar problems are given to smaller groups to solve. Groups, however, vary in many aspects. Pseudo randomly-formed groups compose a large number of modules of feed-forward decision-making systems. The evolution mechanism forms collections of the best modules for each single short time period. Final solutions are carried forward to the global scale where a collection of the best modules is chosen using a multiclass cost-sensitive perceptron. Collected modules are combined in a final solution in an equally weighted approach (1/N Portfolio). The efficacy of the novel decision-making approach was demonstrated through a financial portfolio optimization problem, which yielded adequate amounts of real world data. For portfolio construction, we used 11,730 simulated trading robot performances. The dataset covered the period from 2003 to 2012 when environmental changes were frequent and largely unpredictable. Walk-forward and out-of-sample experiments show that an approach based on sustainable economy principles outperforms benchmark methods and that shorter agent training history demonstrates better results in periods of a changing environment.","[Raudys, Saranas; Raudys, Aistis; Pabarskaite, Idrina] Vilnius Univ, Fac Math & Informat, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Raudys, S (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Math & Informat, Naugarduko G 24, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania.",sarunas.raudys@mif.vu.lt,,,,,,,32,7,7,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

That in turn implies that the insider's strategies are linear in total order flow. We also show that for arbitrary prior distributions, the insider's trading strategy is uniquely determined by a Doob -transform that expresses the insider's informational advantage. This allows us to reformulate the model so that Kyle's liquidity parameter is characterized by a Lagrange multiplier that is the marginal value or shadow price of information.

More committed importers contribute more to the export performance of overseas exporters than less committed importers. The purpose of the study is to examine the factors that motivate importers to be committed to the relationship with their overseas exporters. Drawing on social exchange theory, importer commitment is modeled as a function of (I) the importer's perception of the exporter's commitment, (2) the importer's dependence on the exporter, (3) the importer's transaction-specific investments, (4) the importer's trust of the exporter, and (5) the interaction between (2) dependence on the exporter and (4) trust of the exporter. The model is tested using data collected from 120 Korean importers. The results indicate that Korean importers' commitment to their overseas exporters is affected not only by the Korean importers' perceived commitment of overseas exporters, but also by the Korean importers' dependence on overseas exporters. Further, Korean importers' transaction-specific investments have a positive effect on Korean importers' commitment to their overseas exporters. Korean importers' commitment to their overseas exporters is also affected by the Korean importers' trust of the overseas exporters. Finally, dependence on the exporter and trust of the exporter turn out to affect importer commitment jointly as well as independently. The findings of the study have implications for Korean exporters as to how they can elicit foreign importers' commitment in their relationships.","Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Choi, CB (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,57,1,1,1,7,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We show that when LAMP is introduced into an otherwise standard model of international business cycles, the performance of the model improves significantly, especially in matching cross-country correlations. To perform formal evaluation of the models we develop a novel statistical procedure that adapts the statistical framework of Vuong (1989) to DSGE models. Using this methodology, we show that the improvements brought out by LAMP are statistically significant, leading a model with LAMP to outperform a representative agent model. Furthermore, when LAMP is introduced, a model with complete markets is found to do as well as a model with no trade in financial assets - a well-known favorite in the literature. Our results remain robust to the inclusion of investment specific technology shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using linear and asymmetric panel VECM models, we find that the speed of convergence of external imbalances is much faster in deficit countries than in surplus ones. These results suggest that the adjustment of intra-European imbalances has to take place in both surplus and deficit countries and should be particularly substantial in the former.

J,"Ramirez, CD",,,,"Ramirez, Carlos D.",,,Is corruption in China out of control? A comparison with the US in historical perspective,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corruption; Newspapers; China; US history,ENDOGENOUS CORRUPTION,"This paper compares corruption in China over the past 15 years with corruption in the US between 1870 and 1930, periods that are roughly comparable in terms of real income per capita. Corruption indicators for both countries and both periods are constructed by tracking corruption news in prominent US newspapers. Several robustness checks confirm the reliability of the constructed corruption indices for both countries. The comparison indicates that corruption in the US in the early 1870s, when its real income per capita was about $2800 (in 2005 dollars), was 7-9 times higher than China's corruption level in 1996, the corresponding year in terms of income per capita. By the time the US reached $7500 in 1928, approximately equivalent to China's real income per capita in 2009, corruption was similar in both countries. The findings imply that, while corruption in China is an issue that merits attention, it is not at alarmingly high levels, compared to the US historical experience. In addition, the paper articulates a theoretical framework within which the relationship between corruption and economic development can be understood. The model is used to explain the life-cycle of corruption in the development process rising at the early stages of development, and declining after modernization has taken place. Hence, as China continues its development process, corruption will likely decline. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (1) (2014) 76-91. George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, United States.

Using individual-level data from Japan, a nation with shared homogenous racial and cultural backgrounds, this paper controls for unobservable heterogeneity among Japan's population, thus reducing estimation bias. Three measures for trust in government are used: trust in ministries and government agencies, trust in diet members, and trust in members of municipal councils. After controlling for individual characteristics, the key findings are: (1) people are more likely to express preferences for income redistribution when trust in government in their residential area is high; (2) people are more likely to perceive their tax burden as low when trust in government in their residential area is high; and (3) when the sample is divided into people with above average income and those with below average income, these results are only clearly observed for people with above average income and not those with below average income.","Seinan Gakuin Univ, Nishijin, Japan",,"Yamamura, E (通讯作者)，Seinan Gakuin Univ, Nishijin, Japan.",yamaei@seinan-gu.ac.jp,,,,,,,54,19,21,5,45,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The channel through which technical change is observed is changes in the domestic price of machinery and equipment due to the availability of new and cheaper machines. The analysis also looks at trade-induced skill-biased technical change by taking into account changes in the price of machinery and equipment caused by changes in the tariff rate specific to machinery and equipment. Instrumental variables, including the price of machinery and equipment in the United States, are used to determine causality between the above effects and wages. Thus, the article provides evidence for some recent findings in the literature that link trade liberalization, skill-biased technical change occurring through technology embodied in machines and increases in the skill premium.","Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Caselli, M (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, POB 1, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia.",m.caselli@unsw.edu.au,,"Caselli, Mauro/0000-0002-1132-1665",,,,,61,14,19,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The estimation of conditional income convergence is based on the augmented Solow model with system GMM technique for the dynamic panel data. More importantly, the article assesses the role of initial human capital stock and the rule of law in the income convergence of poor countries by considering further categorizations of the poor countries based on these two variables. This is the first study on the comparative properties of human capital and the rule of law in the income convergence of poor countries utilizing a dynamic panel framework. The full sample of low income countries does not show any evidence of conditional income convergence. The categorizations on the basis of initial human capital stock do not alter the conclusion of no income convergence. However, the subsample of low income countries with a better rule of law exhibits positive evidence of convergence towards the steady states. The article concludes that there exists a greater role of the rule of law, than initial human capital stock, in the income convergence of poor countries and vice versa for the high and middle income countries.","[Khan, Faiza Azhar; Hudson, John] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Khan, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",faiza.fjwu@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,5,9,0,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A landowner decides the timing of development and competes with the regulator in a dynamic Stackelberg game. The regulator anticipates this timing decision and dynamically adjusts the growth boundary accordingly. The regulator should slacken the boundary control as urban rents pass their historically high levels, which is consistent with the existing land-use planning systems. The regulator should also design a smaller urban growth boundary if uncertainty arises because uncertainty will induce the landowners to postpone development.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Jou, JB (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",jbjou@ntu.edu.tw,"JOU, JYH-BANG/L-9428-2018","JOU, JYH-BANG/0000-0002-9507-3370",,,,,38,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Applications with individual duration data,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Segmentation; Local labour markets; Cluster analysis; Mobility; Unemployment duration,UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION; OCCUPATIONAL-MOBILITY; SELF-EMPLOYMENT; SEARCH; MARKET; MIGRATION; MODELS; SPAIN; DIFFERENTIALS; PROBABILITY,"This article proposes empirical tools to account for the role of heterogeneities in the labour matching process, and shows an application to the Andalusian labour market which relies on individual data. The central idea of the paper is that the labour market is segmented, and this segmentation can be treated empirically by grouping workers, jobs and matches into labour groups according to their characteristics. In a segmented labour market the probability that a match occurs in a particular job group affects the probability that a match occurs in a particular worker group or vice versa. We propose two empirical measures related to this idea: propensity to match, and segmentation in worker and job groups. The usefulness of this empirical framework is shown by its application to different labour market analyses. Firstly, we use a clustering methodology, based on a similarity measure, to obtain a better overview of the structure of the labour market. Secondly, we propose a measure of mobility based on our similarity measure, and estimate a regression model that relates mobility to worker and job characteristics and to the economic cycle. Finally, these tools are included in an unemployment duration model. The proposed methodology may be useful in labour intermediation by helping seekers to follow a 'roadmap' of successful paths.

In particular, we develop an international oligopoly model, where governments issue non-cooperatively a number of permits and then allow their trading by their polluting firms. Permits trading is a dominant strategy and it ensures that welfare is strictly higher than in a situation where permits are non-tradable. When the permits market is efficient, exporting countries have an incentive to tighten regulation in order to enhance their firms' competitiveness. Allowing for market power in the permits market, the incentive to relax regulation may re-appear, yet it is comparatively weaker relative to the case of non-tradable permits. The benefits of this policy scheme disappear if the governments along with emission permits adopt an emissions subsidy.","[Antoniou, Fabio] Humboldt Univ, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Hatzipanayotou, Panos; Koundouri, Phoebe] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece; [Hatzipanayotou, Panos] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Athens University of Economics & Business; Ifo Institut,"Antoniou, F (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie 1, Spandauer Str 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",fabio.antoniou@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,"Hatzipanayotou, Panos/AAI-7599-2021; Antoniou, Fabio/ABH-5736-2020; Koundouri, Phoebe/AAI-2160-2021","Koundouri, Phoebe/0000-0001-5979-6128; Hatzipanayotou, Panos/0000-0002-7176-1347; ANTONIOU, FABIO/0000-0002-6943-8057",,,,,31,11,11,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The empirical part of this paper compares two methods of the coordination index construction, the factor analysis and our own alternative calculation.

This way we demonstrate that even when using the same input variables a slight change of method might result into different findings. In the end we therefore argue that the future studies be more careful in the methods used as well as the country and data selection.

Retail trade is also a very important component of GDP, whereby rising retail trade means a growth in consumption and a fall in unemployment. Therefore, policy makers must be able to recognise how changes in economic variables affect changes in retail trade. The main goal of this paper is to analyse the effects of changes in retail prices, net wages and short-term interest rate on nominal retail trade in Croatia using the bounds testing (ARDL) approach for cointegration. The results indicate the existence of a stable cointegration relationship between the variables. In the long-run, an increase in retail prices and short-term interest rate leads to a reduction in nominal retail trade while an increase in net wages boosts an increase in nominal retail trade. In the short-run, a positive change in retail prices has a positive effect on the change in nominal retail trade while positive changes in net wages and short-term interest rate have negative effects on nominal retail trade.","Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Benazic, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mbenaz@unipu.hr,,,,,,,43,3,3,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The model is estimated by the Simulated Method of Moments using a mix of aggregate and sectoral U.S. data. The frequencies of price changes implied by our estimates are consistent with those reported in micro-based studies. We show that heterogeneity in price rigidity is the primary factor explaining the heterogeneity in the responses of sectoral output and inflation to a monetary policy shock. We also find that ignoring sectoral heterogeneity in price rigidity leads to the mismeasurement of the relative importance of aggregate and sector-specific shocks in aggregate and sectoral fluctuations.

The empirical analysis uses per capita GDP, in PPP and in constant prices of 2005 for the period 1950 to 2010. Apart from the traditional DF type tests we also account for possible structural changes. In this direction, we employ the Zivot-Andrews (1992) and the Lee-Strazicich (1999, 2003) testing procedures, for one and two breaks, endogenously determined. Furthermore, we apply the Carlino and Mills (1993) methodology proposed for the detection of beta-convergence. The overall evidence supports the existence of two discrete clubs, the first by the 'cohesion countries' (Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain) and the second by the remaining members. In particular, there is a clear evidence of convergence within each club, whereas between clubs there is a luck of catching-up effects. Furthermore, investigation of correlation between relative per capita GDP of each country and several factors that are often identified as growth stimulants, namely Total Factor Productivity, FDI, investment and openness confirm, with the exception of Greece, a strong association between these factors and the convergence process. However, progress in the convergence has not been uniform across countries and over time, reflecting the specific interactions between domestic and international factors and their impact on the convergence process of individual countries.","[Chapsa, X.; Katrakilidis, C.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Chapsa, X.] Technol Educ Inst Serres, Dept Business Adm, Serres, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Katrakilidis, C (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Econ, POB 213, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",katrak@econ.auth.gr,"Chapsa, Xanthippi/AAM-4812-2021",,,,,,67,8,8,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, we carry out an exhaustive review of the empirical literature where no consensus is reached about the signs of the determinants and we can observe that in the case of the European countries this topic has scarcely received attention, contrary to the US case. Then from the Compustat database and for the period 1992-2009, we estimate quantile regressions that allow possible nonlinear relationships to be detected. The estimations reveal different effects of factors such as size, debt, asset composition and profitability on the effective corporate tax rate depending on the decile. In short, for companies with lower ETRs, the most influential variables are the size, the intensity of inventories and the profitability, whereas for the companies that suffer the highest fiscal pressure it is debt that turns out to be the strongest determinant. These results justify the employment of quantile regression instead of the traditional linear approximations.","[Delgado, Francisco J.; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Elena; Martinez-Arias, Antonio] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo 33007, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Delgado, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Avda Cristo S-N, Oviedo 33007, Spain.",fdelgado@uniovi.es; mefernan@uniovi.es; martinar@uniovi.es,"Fernández-Rodríguez, Elena/B-8069-2019; Delgado, Francisco J./B-6773-2008","Fernández-Rodríguez, Elena/0000-0003-4708-4881; Delgado, Francisco J./0000-0002-5086-7011; Martinez-Arias, Antonio/0000-0002-5755-8131",,,,,58,23,28,2,44,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The empirical analysis relies on three main steps: (i) an econometric analysis based on a sample of developing countries shows that skilled migration has a significant negative impact on productivity in the country of origin, while unskilled migration has a significant positive effect on the same indicator; (ii) using these estimates within a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, calibrated on Cameroonian economy data, we simulate the impact of emigration on macroeconomic indicators and (iii) relying on the 2007 Cameroonian household survey, the CGE model maps consistent changes of commodity and factor prices across households for a micro-simulation analysis. We find that the current pattern of emigration from Cameroon has contributed to an increase in the number of the poor by 0.8 percentage points. The negative effect of skilled emigration on productivity turns out to be more important than the combined positive effects related to remittances transferred and productivity gains from unskilled emigration. This outcome strongly supports actions by developing countries to optimise contributions from their skilled workers living abroad.","[Djiofack, Calvin Z.] World Bank Latin Amer & Caribbean, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Djimeu, Eric W.] Int Initiat Impact Evaluat, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Boussichas, Matthieu] Fdn Etudes & Rech Dev Int, Clermont Ferrand, France",The World Bank,"Djimeu, EW (通讯作者)，Int Initiat Impact Evaluat, 1625 Massachusetts Ave,NW Suite 450, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",edjimeu@3ieimpact.org,,,,,,,65,3,4,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Our analysis follows two steps: i) business cycle transmission is measured using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) method, a pattern recognition algorithm that accounts for the nonlinear and time-varying nature of business cycles and ii) the potential mechanisms of propagation of international business cycles are examined by specifying a panel regression model in which the LCS measure of synchronization is used as the dependent variable. Applying several panel estimation methods to the bilateral data from 22 countries over the 1998-2009 periods, we find that both trade and financial similarities are significant in the transmission of business cycles to Turkish economy. Especially, the results highlight the role of trade integration indicating that Turkish business cycles are closely linked with the business cycles of the members of European Custom Union.

We examine a large sample of groups of households and find that neighborhood effects are significant in a majority of groups, especially in the poorest groups. People living in poor communities tend to suffer from poverty over time. It is of theoretical and empirical importance to explore how neighborhood effects are interrelated with chronic poverty and the channels through which this occurs. Unlike other econometric analyses, we establish a multilevel econometric model to show that: (i) it is difficult for an individual living in a neighborhood with a high proportion of agricultural labor, low education levels, and poor transport and telecommunication infrastructure to escape from poverty traps; (ii) neighborhood effects dominate in poor communities; and (iii) although poverty is affected by group-level factors, individual factors still play a dominant role in regards to escaping poverty when income surpasses a threshold level. Therefore, policy priority should be given to providing social protection and public services, especially in poor rural areas.","[Fang, Yingfeng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Fang, Yingfeng; Zou, Wei] Wuhan Univ, Inst Adv Study, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Zou, W (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Inst Adv Study, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",eco_yingfeng@whu.edu.cn; zouwei@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,38,9,10,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2014,22.0,1,,,,,83,102,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2014.12054.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AJ0RS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000337364000005,0

We also present a simple theory that suggests that, as the influence of socioeconomic background and educational environment on the entrance exam score rises over that of innate talents, labour productivity of overall society appears to decline. Controlling for student talent by using the scholastic ranking of the second year of middle school, we show that the socioeconomic status and learning environment exert a considerable influence on all college admissions criteria in this country.

It is found that when investors' level of heterogeneous beliefs increases, agents who over estimate volatility raise their subjective probability about those outer dividend states and hence increase more consumption to those states. As a result, an increase of consumption causes a decrease of their marginal rate of transformation in outer states. The raising subjective probability increases the prices of outer states, while the lower marginal rate of transformation decreases the prices of that. However, the influence of the former dominates the latter, causing a fatter tail of the state-price density. As a consequence, the values increase for those call options with high strike prices and put options with low strike prices, leading to a U-shaped implied volatility and hence causes a smell effect.","Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Lin, CC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Ying Chuan Rd,Tamsui Adm Bldg,151 Rd,B820, New Taipei City 25137, Taiwan.",139714@tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For example, limited attention, motivated attention, and biased assessments of probability on the part of information recipients can significantly diminish, or even reverse, the intended effects of disclosure requirements. In many cases, disclosure does not much affect the recipients of the information but does significantly affect the behavior of the providers, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

For a precise view of regional economic differentials, the analysis focuses on city regions, using the Urban Audit database provided by the European Commission as a source. Thus far, there is a lack of studies on Europe-wide urban economic differentials and dynamics. After the EU expansion of 2004, economic growth accelerated considerably in the least-developed peripheral regions, but also in the wealthier capital cities of the new member states. The growth analysis, which controls for various city characteristics, a basic city typology, and groups of countries, suggests that in the medium term economic development in Central and Eastern Europe is likely to concentrate in capital cities before it can disperse to peripheral regions. Robustness checks incorporating spatial weights and panel methods confirm the main findings. Regional policy may promote convergence if it supports the infrastructure for education and innovation in the most accessible cities and encourages utilization of these facilities within broader regions.","[Neumann, Uwe; Budde, Ruediger; Ehlert, Christoph] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Neumann, U (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Essen, Germany.",,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

It then analyzes how such adjustment costs affect consumers' risk attitudes. Previous studies have suggested that transaction costs, by resulting in infrequent but lumpy adjustments, magnify consumers' risk aversion with respect to moderate-stake risk and, simultaneously, stimulate the demand for large-stake wealth lotteries. This paper argues that such predictions, while naturally arising in static models, may disappear or even reverse in a dynamic setting, in which consumers can choose when to make an adjustment. Namely, it shows that such an option can eliminate the demand for large-stake lotteries, and that the consumers choosing to delay the adjustment may be more tolerant to moderate-stake risks than in the absence of adjustment costs. The paper also illustrates that both predictions crucially depend on the relationship between the time discount rate in the utility function and the interest rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The semi-parametric approach has potential improvements over both pure parametric and non-parametric estimators. Firstly, in the case where the parametric model is misspecified so that the parametric estimator for the true density is usually inconsistent, the semi-parametric estimator can still be consistent with the true density. Secondly, in comparison with the kernel density estimator, the semi-parametric estimator can result in bias reduction as long as the parametric model can capture some roughness feature of the true density function, whereas the two estimators have the same asymptotic variance. The simulation results show that the proposed approach has good finite sample performance compared with non-parametric approach.

The main finding is that an interest rate rule satisfying the Taylor principle is no longer a sufficient condition to guarantee determinacy. Including interest rate smoothing and a response to output deviations from steady state significantly enlarges the regions of determinacy. However, under all the simple interest rate rules considered, determinacy is not guaranteed for a very high degree of deep habits. Deep habits give rise to countercyclical markups, which is in line with empirical evidence and makes them an appealing feature in the study of demand shocks. The countercyclicality of markups also leads to multiple equilibria because of self-fulfilling expectations for a high degree of deep habit formation.","[Zubairy, Sarah] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Zubairy, Sarah] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Bank of Canada; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Zubairy, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",szubairy@econmail.tamu.edu,,,,,,,16,8,10,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We consider a Bertrand oligopoly with firms using either least squares learning or gradient learning for determining the price. We demonstrate that convergence properties of the rules are strongly affected by heterogeneity. In particular, gradient learning may become unstable as the number of gradient learners increases. Endogenous choice between the learning rules may induce cyclical switching. Stable gradient learning gives higher average profit than least squares learning, making firms switch to gradient learning. This can destabilize gradient learning which, because of decreasing profits, makes firms switch back to least squares learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main result is that aggregate TFP shocks lead to large fluctuations of labor market quantities if the model is calibrated to the empirically observed countercyclicality of the finance premium. A financial accelerator mechanism thus amplifies labor market fluctuations by rendering rigidity in real wage dynamics. In contrast, if the finance premium is procyclical, which the model can be parameterized to accommodate, amplification is absent, and labor-market fluctuations display the Shimer (2005) puzzle.

In this paper, China's OFDI is characterized in a North-South two-country oligopoly FDI model with a public firm in the South aiming to maximize social welfare instead of only its own profit. It is shown that compared to the fully privatized industry, the public firm is more inclined to conduct cross-border M&A but less efficiency oriented, and such M&A is more harmful to the destination country as a whole. We also show that the public firm is socially desirable for the source country when there is foreign competition. The intuition is that the public firm, although less efficient, minimizes the horizontal externalities and acts as a proxy of the regulator and protects home private firms from foreign competition in the export market. Therefore, such OFDI strengthens private firms' exports to the destination country. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Thresholds for debt are theory-driven and depend on macroeconomic conditions. If the nominal interest rate exceeds nominal output growth, primary budget surpluses are required to achieve a sustainable government debt ratio. The negative impact of the debt-to-GDP ratio is limited to the euro area and periods of nonsustainable public debt. In the broader panel of industrial countries, the negative debt effect diminishes. Instead, debt will exert a positive impact on growth given that it is sustainable. This result is fairly robust and holds even for exogenous thresholds. While the relationship between debt and growth is subject to nonlinearities, the evidence suggests that the participation in monetary union might entail an additional risk for its members.

By adopting a fixed effect dynamic GMM estimation methodology we attempt to address the potential bias that arises from the presence of time-invariant unobserved characteristics of a PFA and the endogeneity of several regressors. There is a significant positive effect of own-lagged crime rate. The own-lagged effect is stronger for property crime, on an average, than violent crime. We find that, on an average, higher detection rate and prison population leads to lower property and violent crimes. This is robust to various specifications.

The main mechanism emphasized in this paper is the bracket creep effect according to which inflation pushes income into higher tax brackets. Governments adjust the nominal income tax brackets slowly and incompletely due to the rise in prices. In the U.S. postwar history, this typically happens less often than once every other tax year. In the first part of the paper, we study time series from the U.S. economy. As our central result we find that irrespective of the level of inflation more frequent income tax schedule adjustments make the relationship between inflation and income inequality more transitory in nature. In the second part of the paper, we develop a general equilibrium monetary model with income heterogeneity that is in line with our time series evidence. We find that a longer duration between two successive adjustments of the tax schedule reduces employment, savings, and output. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We examine whether this property is related to monetary policy or not by using Japanese monthly data with consideration for structural changes. Results of structural change tests show that the term spread has predictive ability for the future economic activity from 1982:4 to 1997:8. Decomposing the term spread into three parts; one is explained by past monetary policy shocks, another is explained by expected future call rates and the other is the remaining part, we find that all three parts are significantly related to the future economic growth rate.

Based on Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) survey data, we find that body size has an inverted U-shaped effect on the probability of being employed when human capital and other factors are controlled, indicating the existence of body size discrimination. Based on our results, the optimal BMI for employment is estimated to be 22.7 for female and 24.3 for male. Further studies show that the health channel and the esthetic channel play an important role in forming the body size discrimination among both male and female. Furthermore, we find that the employment type (formal employment vs. informal employment) is also affected by body size.

Before, in April this year, the European Parlianient said no to the multi-annual budget which Governments of the European Union member Countries had agreed upon in February 2013. The changes realized with the final agreement are minimal, but in some aspect essential, so that a strong message was sent to governments by the only institution in Europe elected by its citizens. The budget for 2014-2020 is unsatisfactory due to both method and content. To method, because it is a deficit budget which leaves the European Commission with little margin of flexibility for anti-recession measures. To content, because it favours redistributive policies between European countries rather than policies encouraging growth and employment throughout the European Union. It is an austerity budget which is deeply anti-Keynesian in a period of serious economic crisis analogous to the great depression of the 1930s. A policy of growth at a European level is needed in order to cope with the economic depression, yet a policy of rigour and austerity was proposed.","[Pini, Paolo] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ & Management, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Pini, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",paolo.pini@economia.unife,"PINI, PAOLO/ITT-3182-2023",,,,,,10,2,2,0,12,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

If asset trade in the initial period takes place before the announcement of policy, a national policy maker can choose a policy rule that reduces the work effort of households in the policy maker's country, in the knowledge that consumption is fully insured by optimally chosen international portfolio positions. But if asset trade takes place after the policy announcement, this insurance is absent and households in the policy maker's country bear the full consumption consequences of the chosen policy rule. The welfare incentives faced by national policy makers are very different between the two cases. Numerical examples confirm that asset-market timing has a significant impact on the optimal policy rule.","[Senay, Ozge; Sutherland, Alan] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Senay, O (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",os12@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Sutherland, Alan/0000-0002-0175-3886; Senay, Ozge/0000-0002-8310-968X",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-156-25-0027] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [RES-156-25-0027] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,20,5,5,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Second, a symmetrical three-dimensional trade model is constructed to explain trade among South Africa, the EU and China by means of differences in the endowment with skilled labour, less skilled labour and capital. The discussion of the actual trade model is visualised by means of the concept of the endowment triangle. Third, a detailed descriptive analysis that uses and combines three different classification measures supports the theoretical predictions of the developed trade model.

A country's tax policies have asymmetric effects on the pricing behaviors of domestic and overseas producers. International cooperation endogenizes the externality that improves the purchasing power of foreign residents, but at the cost of its own residents' work efforts. The first-best taxes are lower than in the noncooperative case. When world welfare is utilitarian, smaller economies may experience welfare losses from cooperation under the weak income effect of sales tax.

Policy evaluation in the frequency domain is interesting because the characterization of policy effects frequency by frequency gives the policymaker additional information about the effects of a given policy. Further, some important aspects of policy analysis can be better understood in the frequency domain than in the time domain. In this paper, I develop a rich set of design limits that describe fundamental restrictions on how a policymaker can alter variance at different frequencies. I also examine the interaction of measurement error and model uncertainty to understand the effects of different sources of informational limit on optimal policymaking. In a linear feedback model with noisy state observations, measurement error seriously distorts the performance of the policy rule that is optimal for the noise-free system. Adjusting the policy to appropriately account for measurement error means that the policymaker becomes less responsive to the raw data. For a parameterized example which corresponds to the choice of monetary policy rules in a simple AR(1) environment, I show that an additive white noise process of measurement error has little impact at low frequencies but induces less active control at high frequencies, and even may lead to more aggressive policy actions at medium frequencies. Local robustness analysis indicates that measurement error reduces the policymaker's reaction to model uncertainty, especially at medium and high frequencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Its role, which was emphasized in the literature, is taken up by global financial risk shocks. (3) Country spread shocks explain about 15 percent of the business cycles in emerging economies.

Uninsured idiosyncratic shocks generate bond trades, while aggregate shocks cause fluctuations in the trading price of bonds. Long bonds command a liquidation risk premium over short bonds, because they may have to be liquidated before maturity following a bad idiosyncratic shock precisely when their resale value is low due to the simultaneous occurrence of a bad aggregate shock. Our framework endogenously generates limited cross-sectional wealth heterogeneity among the agents (despite the presence of uninsured idiosyncratic shocks), which allows us to characterise analytically the shape of the entire yield curve, including the yields on bonds of arbitrarily long maturities. Agents' desire to hedge the idiosyncratic risk together with their fear of having to liquidate long bonds at unfavourable terms implies that a greater bond supply raises the level of the yield curve, while an increase in the relative supply of long bonds raises its slope.

This article reports on a two-year field experiment in the Indian state of Gujarat that sought to curb such a conflict by altering the market structure for environmental audits of industrial plants to incentivize accurate reporting. There are three main results. First, the status quo system was largely corrupted, with auditors systematically reporting plant emissions just below the standard, although true emissions were typically higher. Second, the treatment caused auditors to report more truthfully and very significantly lowered the fraction of plants that were falsely reported as compliant with pollution standards. Third, treatment plants, in turn, reduced their pollution emissions. The results suggest reformed incentives for third-party auditors can improve their reporting and make regulation more effective.","[Duflo, Esther] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Duflo, E (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1066006] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,41,172,198,4,100,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Besides the standard Minnesota prior, we also use additional priors that constrain the sum of coefficients of the VAR models. We compare 1- to 24-months-ahead forecasts of the large-scale models over an out-of-sample horizon of 1995:01-2009:03, based on an in-sample of 1968:02-1994:12, relative to a random walk model, a small-scale VAR model comprising just the five real house price growth rates and a medium-scale VAR model containing 36 of the 145 fundamental variables besides the five real house price growth rates. In addition to the forecast comparison exercise across small-, medium- and large-scale models, we also look at the ability of the optimal' model (i.e. the model that produces the minimum average mean squared forecast error) for a specific region in predicting ex ante real house prices (in levels) over the period of 2009:04 till 2012:02. Factor-based models (classical or Bayesian) perform the best for the North East, Mid-West, West census regions and the aggregate US economy and equally well to a small-scale VAR for the South region. The optimal' factor models also tend to predict the downward trend in the data when we conduct an ex ante forecasting exercise.

We treat denominations akin to multinational enterprises, which decide which countries to enter based on local market conditions and their own productivity. The model guides us in estimating how a denomination's religious doctrine and governance structure affect its ability to attract adherents. Using data on the foreign operations of US Protestant denominations in 2005 from the World Christian Database, we find that (1) denominations with stricter religious doctrine attract more adherents in countries in which the risk of natural disaster or disease outbreak is greater and in which government provision of health services is weaker, and (2) denominations with a decentralized governance structure attract more adherents in countries in which the pastor cost of connecting with congregants is lower. These findings illuminate factors shaping the composition of religion within countries, helping account for the rise of new Protestant groups.

Specifically, a stated preference choice experiment is conducted in the Canary Islands' residential market where limited competition exists. Preferences for different electricity suppliers and three level-of-service attributes are investigated, namely, supply reliability, share of renewable energies and availability of a complementary energy audit service. The results might be interpreted as an indication of different aspects new firms need to consider if they plan to enter in the market. There is an opportunity for new companies to establish in the market, though evidence of brand loyalty to the current company and/or significant switching costs are also found, especially in the case of older people. Regarding the estimated WTP, several results should be highlighted. First, customers who have experienced more serious outages in the past tend to show a higher WTP to reduce the outage frequency. Second, highly-educated respondents, those who state a great concern for the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and those who carry out energy saving actions in their homes exhibit a larger WTP for renewable energies.

In this hierarchy, monetary transfer is not feasible, delegation is made sequentially, and all players are strategic. We characterize the optimal delegation mechanism. It is shown that the single-interval delegation a la Holmstrom is optimal only when the intermediary is moderately biased. Otherwise, as responses to the distortion caused by a biased intermediary, the optimal delegation set may involve a hole. Thus, multi-interval delegation set would arise when subordinates have opposing biases. This result sheds some light on policy threshold effects: slight changes in the underlying state cause a jump in the policy responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The increment in global warming and the instability in the petroleum oil market have motivated companies to find alternatives to reduce energy use. In the academic literature several researchers have demonstrated that optimization models can be successfully used to reduce energy use. This research presents the use of an optimization model to identify feasible economic alternatives to reduce energy use. The economic analysis methods used were the payback and the internal rate of return. The optimization model developed in this research was applied and validated using an electronic manufacturing company case study. The results demonstrate that the main variables affecting the economic feasibility of the alternatives are the economic analysis method and the initial implementation costs. Several scenarios were analyzed and the best results show that the manufacturing company could save up to $78,000 in three years if the recommendations based on the optimization model results are implemented.

It develops a model where firms can invest in baseload plants with a fixed variable cost and peak plants with a random variable cost, and demand for electricity varies over time but is perfectly predictable. At equilibrium the electricity price is partly determined by the random variable cost and the returns from the two kinds of plants are negatively correlated. When the variable cost of the peak technology is high the return of peak plants is low but the return to baseload plants is high. Risk-averse firms reduce the capacity of the riskiest technology and develop the capacity of the other, compared to risk-neutral firms. In the particular case where a risk-neutral firm invests heavily in baseload technology and only sparely in peak capacity, a risk-averse firm would invest less in baseload, increase peak capacity, and increase total installed capacity.

Results have varied widely. This work builds upon reports from operating facilities and other primary data sources to build a database of front end environmental impacts. This work also addresses land transformation and water withdrawals associated with the processes of the FEFC These processes include uranium extraction, conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication, depleted uranium disposition, and transportation. To allow summing the impacts across processes, all impacts were normalized per tonne of natural uranium mined as well as per MWh(e) of electricity produced, a more conventional unit for measuring environmental impacts that facilitates comparison with other studies. This conversion was based on mass balances and process efficiencies associated with the current once-through LWR fuel cycle. Total energy input is calculated at 8.7 x 10(-3) GJ(e)/MWh(e) of electricity and 5.9 x 10(-3) GJ(t)/MWh(e) of thermal energy. It is dominated by the energy required for uranium extraction, conversion to fluoride compound for subsequent enrichment, and enrichment. An estimate of the carbon footprint is made from the direct energy consumption at 1.7 kg CO2/MWh(e). Water use is likewise dominated by requirements of uranium extraction, totaling 154 L/MWh(e). Land use is calculated at 8 x 10(-3) m(2)/MWh(e), over 90% of which is due to uranium extraction. Quantified impacts are limited to those resulting from activities performed within the FEFC process facilities (i.e. within the plant gates). Energy embodied in material inputs such as process chemicals and fuel cladding is identified but not explicitly quantified in this study. Inclusion of indirect energy associated with embodied energy as well as construction and decommissioning of facilities could increase the FEFC energy intensity estimate by a factor of up to 2.

Recessions and interpersonal trust in Latin America,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Trust; Recessions; Religion; Latin America,INSTITUTIONS; EXPERIENCES; RELIGION,"Trust is critical during times of institutional crisis, but intuition is ambiguous with regards to economic calamity: would a scarcer supply of goods cause greater animosity, or does a worsening economic climate constitute a common foe against which people can unite? This study investigates the relationship between the experience of recent recessionary years and levels of interpersonal trust, specifically in Latin America. First, we find that as the number of recessionary years grows larger, the strength of interpersonal trust increases; the results are generally robust to the effects of time and alternate measurements of recession. Second, levels of trust are positively correlated with confidence in the central government but negatively with corruption, robust to political ideology. Finally, we refute the assertion that Catholicism hinders economic growth through strong vertical trust channels. Instead, we find that religiosity, especially Catholicism, increases levels of interpersonal trust. Understanding such relationships opens doors for policy tools which can utilize strong central government or community-level efforts without sacrificing levels of trust in the alternate measure, in addition to options which take a hybrid approach.

And this article defines three factors of the term structure of credit spreads: level, slope and curvature. Based on these three factors and several macroeconomic variables, VAR models are developed and tested to forecast macroeconomic variables. The empirical results confirm that VAR models can predict the changes of China's macroeconomy well, which indicates that the term structure of credit spreads contains information of future changes of macroeconomic variables.

Two-stage auctions have a first stage where favored developers signal that auctions are taken, deterring entry of other bidders.

We extend results from the literature on optimal collusion by investigating the role of a limited liability constraint. We examine all situations in which either structural conditions, financial considerations, or institutional circumstances set a lower bound, possibly negative, to firms' profits. For a large class of repeated games we show that, when the limited liability constraint binds, there exists an infinity of multi-period punishment paths that permit firms to implement the optimal collusive strategy. The usual front-loading scheme is only a specific case and an optimal punishment profile can take the form of a price asymmetric cycle. We characterize the situations in which a longer punishment does not perform as a perfect substitute for more immediate severity. In this case, the lowest discount factor that permits collusion is strictly higher than without the limited liability constraint, which hinders collusion.","[de Villemeur, Etienne Billette] Univ Lille, EQUIPPE, Lille, France; [Flochel, Laurent] Charles River Associates Inc, Paris, France; [Versaevel, Bruno] EMLYON Business Sch, Lyon, France; [Versaevel, Bruno] CNRS, GATE, UMR 5824, Lyon, France",Universite de Lille; emlyon business school; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"de Villemeur, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, EQUIPPE, Lille, France.",etienne.de-villemeur@univ-lille1.fr,"de VILLEMEUR, Etienne BILLETTE/AAE-1545-2020","de VILLEMEUR, Etienne BILLETTE/0000-0002-8821-0947; VERSAEVEL, Bruno/0000-0003-2866-2228",,,,,43,0,0,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

As part of identifying effects of different types of liberalizations, we present a method for calibrating the magnitude of deviations from the hypothetical competitive outcome in different parts of the energy industry in Western Europe. We find that a liberalization of electricity markets has greater quantity and welfare effects than a liberalization of gas markets, and that liberalizations of domestic energy markets have (overall) greater effects than liberalizations of trade in energy between Western European countries. Finally, the short-run effects essentially parallel the long-run effects, though they are significantly smaller. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Golombek, Rolf; Kittelsen, Sverre A.

In particular, it considers a multi-sectoral growth model in discrete time with infinite horizon, endogenous growth, embodied technological progress, horizontal differentiation and lab-equipment specification of R&D. In this model we show analytically that an increase in the productivity of the different sectors (final good sector, equipment sector, intermediate good sector, R&D sector) has an everlasting effect on growth. The conclusion is that when an ICT-driven growth episode is due to the rise of the productivity of one of these sectors, this episode is likely to have permanent effects in the economy. The numerical simulation of the model, then, allows to get some further insights. Finally, an extension of the model that takes into account the presence of learning and spillover effects is able to reproduce empirically the behavior of US productivity in the recent years.

The main purpose of this paper is to give an overview about access to micro-credit for rural poor and its impact on their poverty situation and relevant factors related to income of the micro-credit recipients. Data was collected in two phases from the same respondents (April 2009 and April 2010) using a face-to-face interview schedule from a sample of 360 micro-credit recipients. Additionally, another set of 60 non-credit beneficiary respondents was also taken as a control group to compare the consequences of the program. Major findings reveal that positive impact was found on income, assets endowment, standard of living and poverty reduction. Utilization of credit appears to be major factor for credit recipients raising income compared to their control group. This shows that micro-credit tends to be an important factor to have an impact on household income which minimizes the poverty situation to a reasonable extent.","[Mazumder, Mohummed Shofi Ullah; Lu Wencong] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310085, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mazumder, Mohummed Shofi Ullah] Sher E Bangla Agr Univ, Dept AEIS, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh",Zhejiang University; Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU),"Lu, WC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Zi Jin Gang Campus, Hangzhou 310085, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",shofi_keron@yahoo.com; wenclu@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,41,5,6,1,25,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In this design, students are given an endowment that they can invest on a task where payoff depends on performance. The task is a written verbal test which is graded nonanonymously by their teacher, in a random half of the classrooms, and graded anonymously by an external examiner in the other random half of the classrooms. We find significant evidence that students' choices reflect perceptions of biases in teachers' grading practices. Our results suggest systematic gender effects: students invest more with male teachers. Moreover, if we use the choices made with an external examiner as a benchmark, this result seems to come from two effects which complement each other: when comparing students' choices with their teacher to those made with an external examiner, we find that male students invest less with female teachers while female students invest more with male teachers.

I use the strategic branch location choices of the two largest MFIs in a mature, concentrated market to reveal their objectives. I consider location decisions to be the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium outcome of a one-shot game where the MFIs simultaneously choose markets in which to locate as well as how many branches to open in each. Applying the duality principle, I nest fully a pure profit-maximization objective within a poverty targeting motive. I test the model using comprehensive data from Bangladesh in 2003. Structurally estimating profit and impact functions, my MSM estimates suggest that pure profit maximization cannot explain the branch placement pattern for Grameen Bank or BRAC: they both deviate towards poverty alleviation.

The data from the Czech leading auction site Bonus.cz were chosen for the test. Observed closing prices distribution of about 69% of commonly auctioned items fits the model. However, we find some theoretical and practical flaws in the model. Contrary to the model predictions, we observed that auctions with smaller price increments generated significantly higher revenue than auctions with higher price increments. We suggest that bidders who favour skewness in payoff distribution cause auctions with lower price increment run longer and therefore explain this discrepancy.","[Svoboda, Miroslav; Bocak, Petr] Univ Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Svoboda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",miroslav.svoboda@vse.cz,"Svoboda, Miroslav/AAE-5534-2020",,,,,,11,0,0,0,11,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This ratio is not only an indicator to account for country-specific technology heterogeneity or technology heterogeneity across a group of countries to measure improvement toward the meta-frontier. This ratio also computes the absolute value difference between the real and ideal minimum marginal abatement costs for the non-market good CO2 to achieve specific emission reduction. An equally weighted combination of technological readiness and innovation is used to classify countries into groups. The value of the MTCR via the computation of the meta marginal abatement cost (MAC(meta)) and group marginal abatement cost (MAC(group-k)) allows us to identify the possible improvement of marginal abatement cost (MAC) in absolute value. That is, observation of the MTCR, along with its components the MAC(meta) and MAC(group-k), provides more intuitive and comprehensive information for commanding the cost performance of CO2 reduction than the traditional meta-technology ratio alone.

The paper makes a critical distinction between downstream and upstream industries, focusing on the indirect effects of regulation in upstream industries on firm performance in downstream manufacturing industries. We identify the differential effect of these policies on firm productivity growth depending on how far incumbents are relative to the technological frontier. Trade and product market reforms are found to deliver stronger gains for firms that are closer to the industry-level technological frontier, while the reverse holds for financial market reforms. The key conclusion that can be derived from the empirical analysis is that further product, trade and financial market reforms would bring substantial gains in China and could therefore speed up the convergence process. Taken at face value, the empirical estimates would imply that aligning product, trade and financial market regulation to the average level observed in OECD countries would bring aggregate manufacturing productivity gains of respectively 9%, 3% and 6.5% after 5 years.

During this period, job changes caused by separations from the initial job that were involuntary from the workers point of view increased and the wage losses from job change grew. As well, while age-earnings profiles for continuously employed career workers remained the same in 1993 and 2003, the age-earnings profiles of newly hired workers grew flatter during the period. Hence, an erosion in the earnings of newly hired workers relative to incumbent workers occurred and the effect was to increase the job change wage losses for older workers. Thus, while the losses from changing jobs grew in general, they also grew more age-related over the sample period. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper sheds light on the role of aspects of labor taxation for the international location of headquarters. While profit taxes can be avoided in various ways, it is much harder for firms to manipulate the firm-specific labor tax base so that labor taxes may be relatively important for firm location. We construct a unique data set of effective labor taxes in 120 countries and use data on the location of 35,206 firms to analyze the impact of labor income tax rates, the progressivity of the income tax schedule, and social security contributions on firms' decisions where to locate their headquarters. The findings suggest that both a higher progressivity of the tax system and higher (employee- and employer-borne) social security contributions negatively influence a country's attractiveness for headquarters location. Hence, a one percentage point increase in these payroll taxes, reduces the probability of a country to attract headquarters by 6.1 %. The results prove robust in various empirical model specifications and subsets of the data.","[Egger, Peter] ETH, KOF, WEH E 5, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] CEPR, London, England; [Egger, Peter; Radulescu, Doina] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter] GEP Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Peter] Oxford Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England; [Radulescu, Doina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Strecker, Nora] ETH, KOF, WEH C 14, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; University of Oxford; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Radulescu, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",egger@kof.ethz.ch; radulescu@kof.ethz.ch; strecker@kof.ethz.ch,"Radulescu, Doina/R-6762-2018","Radulescu, Doina/0000-0002-9708-2502; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Strecker, Nora/0000-0002-3782-5618",,,,,52,10,11,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The design of public transfers obviously influences the production and consumption and consequently also the degree of economic dependency of children and the elderly. We propose economic dependency ratios which are based on age-specific consumption and labour income or age-specific public contributions/benefits, respectively, illustrating them in a comparison of Austria and Sweden. Although these two countries are very similar economies in terms of production, income and the size of the public sector, there are remarkable differences in the design of public transfers, in their distribution over age-groups and consequently in the shape of the average economic lifecycle. Using the economic dependency ratios we show that the financial sustainability of the public transfer system depends beside the demographic developments strongly on its design: the Swedish system collects the contributions from a wider range of age groups, transfers a smaller share to the elderly and provides more support to younger generations, supporting them to invest in children of their own. These characteristics have a positive effect on the sustainability of the Swedish system: although in Sweden there is a larger share of the population in the age group 60+, the total economic dependency of elderly persons is lower.","[Hammer, Bernhard; Prskawetz, Alexia] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Prskawetz, Alexia] Austrian Acad Sci, Vienna Inst Demog, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Prskawetz, Alexia] Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien; Austrian Academy of Sciences,"Hammer, B (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, Argentinierstr 8-4-105-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",bernhard.hammer@econ.tuwien.ac.at; afp@econ.tuwien.ac.at,,"Hammer, Bernhard/0000-0003-3082-6383",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I 347] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),,,7,2,3,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2013,40.0,3,,,SI,,541,560,,10.1007/s10663-013-9219-x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,181KH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321666000008,0

We rely on five measures of technological intensity to proxy for investments that are likely to be specific to a buyer-seller relationship. A theoretical model that allows for varying degrees of investment specificity and interrelatedness-externalities between buyer and supplier investments-guides the analysis. Property rights predictions on the link between investment intensities and optimal ownership are strongly supported, but only for transactions with low interrelatedness.

The test is asymptotically distributed under the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity as chi-squared with one degree of freedom. The power of the test is sensitive to the choice of parametric restriction used by the Wald statistics, so the supremum of a range of individual test statistics is proposed. Two versions of a supremum-based test are considered: the first version does not have a known asymptotic null distribution, so the bootstrap is employed to approximate its empirical distribution. The second version has a known asymptotic distribution and, in some cases, is asymptotically pivotal under the null. A simulation study illustrates the use and finite-sample performance of both versions of the test. In this study, the bootstrap is found to provide better size control than asymptotic critical values, namely with heavy-tailed, asymmetric distributions of the covariates. In addition, the use of well-known modifications of the heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator of OLS coefficients is also found to benefit the tests' overall behaviour.","[Murteira, Jose M.

However, recent theoretical contributions have emphasized that trade costs - such as transaction costs related to cross-border trade procedures - affect both the traded volumes of old' goods (the intensive margin) and the range of traded goods (the extensive margin). This article therefore tests whether trade facilitation affects the extensive margin by counting the number of 8-digit products that are exported from developing to EU countries, and using this as the dependent variable in an estimation. Moreover, it also tests whether the extensive margins in differentiated and homogeneous goods are affected in the same way by transaction costs. Estimation results suggest that if export transaction costs - proxied by the number of days needed to export a good - declined by 1%, the number of exported differentiated and homogeneous products would rise by 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. Policy simulations further illustrate that if all countries were as efficient at the border as the most efficient country at the same level of development, the number of exported differentiated and homogeneous products would increase by 62% and 26%, respectively.","[Persson, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Maria] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Persson, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",maria.persson@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,54,47,49,2,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Workers with more education than required for their jobs are observed to suffer wage penalties relative to workers with the same education in jobs that require their educational level. Similarly, workers with less education than required for their jobs earn wage rewards. These departures from the Mincer human capital earnings function can be explained by Nash bargaining between workers and employers. Under fairly mild assumptions, Nash bargaining predicts a wage penalty for overeducation and a wage reward for undereducation. This paper reviews the established empirical regularities and then provides Nash bargaining results that explain these regularities. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The distinction between small-and-medium-size firms (SMEs) and large-size firms or an analysis of both firm and industry level data was even more difficult to find. This paper attempts to answer these two questions simultaneously by introducing a multilevel model that identifies both firm level micro variables and industry level macro variables by using a cross-sectional data set. Our analysis finds a strong positive relationship between openness and firm performance measured by revenue at both industry and firm levels. Among the firm level variables, the size of a firm measured by the number of workers and the quality of human resources measured by the number of employees with postgraduate educations show significantly positive effects on firm revenue whereas the R&D intensity of a firm displays a negative relationship with firm performance because of the possible time lag between investment and its outcome of revenue. The interaction between openness and the quality of human resources has a negative effect on revenue, but the interaction between openness and R&D intensity has a positive effect on firm performance. Additionally we provided an analysis comparing the manufacturing industry with the service industry to check any different effects of openness on firm revenue. The analysis shows that firm performance measured by revenue responds more elastically to the quality of human resources and R&D intensity in the service industry than the manufacturing industry.","[Seop, Hwang Yun; Min, Kim Hag] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Min, KH (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",hys@khu.ac.kr; edoctor@khu.ac.kr; hariskim@bok.or.kr,"Kim, Hag-MIn/AAF-7673-2021","Kim, Hag-MIn/0000-0002-5638-3739",,,,,90,0,0,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Many EU countries introduced private pension schemes to compensate declining public pension levels due to reforms made necessary by demographic change. In 2001, Germany introduced the Riester pension. Ten years after introduction the prevalence rate of this voluntary private pension scheme approximates 37 %. However, numerous criticisms raise doubts that the market for Riester products is transparent. Using the 2010 German SAVE survey, this article investigates terminated and dormant Riester contracts on a household level for the first time. Respectively 14.5 and 12.5 % of households who own or have owned a Riester contract terminated or set dormant their contract. We find that around 45 % of terminated or dormant Riester contracts are caused at least partly by product-related reasons, which is significantly higher than for endowment life insurance contracts. The uptake of a new contract after a termination is more likely if a termination is product-related. Nevertheless, after a termination 73 % of households do not sign a new contract, which can have serious long-term consequences for old-age income. Households with low income, low financial wealth or low pension literacy are more likely to have terminated or dormant contracts. Low income and low financial wealth households also have the lowest prevalence rate of Riester contracts and are at higher risk of old-age poverty.","[Ziegelmeyer, Michael] Banque Cent Luxembourg, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Ziegelmeyer, Michael] Munich Ctr Econ Aging, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Nick, Julius] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-55122 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Ziegelmeyer, M (通讯作者)，Banque Cent Luxembourg, 2 Blvd Royal, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",michael.ziegelmeyer@bcl.lu,,,,,,,54,4,4,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2013,40.0,3,,,SI,,505,539,,10.1007/s10663-013-9220-4,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,181KH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321666000007,0

Using an empirical model, we find substantial heterogeneity in reactions to these shocks across countries. In comparison to the U.S. and other developed countries, emerging economies suffer much more severe falls in investment and private consumption following an exogenous uncertainty shock, take significantly longer to recover, and do not experience a subsequent overshoot in activity. We provide evidence that the dynamics of investment and consumption are correlated with the depth of financial markets. We control for the potential role of a credit channel, and estimate that it can account for up to one-half of the increased fall in investment generated by uncertainty shocks among emerging economies with less-developed financial markets. In this context, monetary and fiscal policy actions that alleviate the impact of credit constraints facing firms may reduce the impact of uncertainty shocks in these economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For small levels of ambiguity, there exists an equilibrium with inertia where agents also insure fully against Knightian uncertainty. When the level of ambiguity exceeds a critical threshold, full insurance no longer prevails and there exist equilibria with inertia where agents do not insure against uncertainty at all.

The models treat the time among extreme events in oil markets as a stochastic process. The main advantage of this approach is its capability to capture the short, medium and long-term behavior of extremes without involving an arbitrary stochastic volatility model or a prefiltration of the data, as is common in extreme value theory applications. We make use of the proposed model in order to obtain an improved estimate for the Value at Risk in oil markets. Empirical findings suggest that the reliability and stability of Value at Risk estimates improve as a result of finer modeling approach.

The reform was backed by the new Law on Corporate Income Tax executed from January 1, 2008. Using national statistics of 2007, we obtain that the optimal unified enterprise tax rate for manufacturing industries is 21.82% if tax revenue is given. In addition, we find the globally optimal enterprise tax rates are 33.11%, 18.17%, and 18.06% for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) and other private enterprises (OPEs), respectively. Our results suggest the achieved aim to pack those inefficient FIEs off and gain a competitive edge for China. Comparing the optimal unified enterprise tax rate equilibrium with benchmark equilibrium, unified enterprise tax rate at 25% equilibrium and globally optimal enterprise tax rate equilibrium, we conclude that the optimal unified enterprise tax rate (21.82%) is an efficient policy for Chinese government. At last, it shows the reliability of the conclusion when sensitivity analysis on enterprise tax rate for FIEs and premium coefficient is performed for optimal unified enterprise tax rate equilibrium.

Our results show that discriminatory pricing may be either more, less or equally favorable to entry than uniform pricing. The welfare effect of banning price discrimination is also ambiguous. However, the case for banning price discrimination is much weaker than under monopoly.

However, previous research finds that stricter IPR increase development, especially among multinational firms in technology-intensive industries. I examine whether the impact of IPR on growth is different depending on a level of FDI, because previous research either looked at a few episodes of IPR reforms, or a specific source or a recipient of FDI, thus potentially overlooking the global effect. Using dynamic panel data techniques and a sample of 103 countries over 1970-2009, I find that although FDI and IPR have positive effects on growth for most of the countries, stronger IPR mitigates the growth effect of FDI for developing countries. Moreover, at the highest levels of FDI, lax IPR increase growth. The effect works through capital accumulation and TFP improvements.","Japan External Trade Org IDE JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Mihama Ku, Chiba 2618545, Japan",,"Kashcheeva, M (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org IDE JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",Mila_Kashcheeva@ide.go.jp,,,,,,,28,13,13,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Yet in the energy literature, there is no consensus on the appropriate method for defining and measuring energy efficiency. This paper sets out the shadow value of energy as a proper and meaningful marginal energy efficiency index. A restricted profit function is used to model the shadow value. We explore four scenarios to characterize and evaluate the shadow value of energy: a within country comparison of different production processes with different energy requirements, a comparison of different countries with different resource endowment, a government policy to impose a tax to alter the shadow value to address environmental issues and a within country comparison of externalities arising from two sources of energy. A comparative static analysis is carried out to sign the functional arguments defined for the shadow value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While insightful, a comprehensive understanding also needs to take into account the supply side. The state, as the ultimate supplier of institutional changes, plays the pivotal role of agency; therefore, its willingness and ability decide how such regime change occurs and what particular form the new regime takes. Since the mid-1990s, the Chinese economy has embarked on a path of rapid industrialization and urbanization. The contestation over rural land development rights in China offers an excellent case to illuminate the importance of state agency in institutional changes. Drawing on case studies in China's three major urbanizing regions, this article analyzes how villages brought their own land directly to the land market and reaped handsome profits. We argue that the three successful cases, Nanhai in Guangdong, Kunshan in Jiangsu and Zhenggezhuang in Beijing, all represent a product of active agency on the supply side. The Chinese state's fragmented authority provides a favorable institutional environment for such changes.","[Su, Fubing] Vassar Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY USA; [Tao, Ran] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Vassar College; Renmin University of China; Zhejiang University,"Wang, H (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fusu@vassar.edu; rantao1972@ruc.edu.cn; wanghuidn@zju.edu.cn,"Wang, Hui/GVS-5250-2022",,,,,,37,20,21,0,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL,2013,21.0,4,,,,,36,55,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12027.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,180BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321566600003,0

We investigate the relationship between consequential measures of cognitive ability and measures of social preferences. We have data on a series of small-stakes dictator-type decisions, known as Social Value Orientation (SVO), in addition to choices in a larger-stakes dictator game. We also have access to the grade point averages (GPA) and SAT (formerly referred to as the Scholastic Aptitude Test) outcomes of our subjects. We find that subjects who perform better on the Math portion of the SAT are more generous in both the dictator game and the SVO measure. By contrast we find that subjects with a higher CPA are more selfish in the dictator game and more generous according to the SVO. We also find some evidence that the subjects with higher GPA and higher SAT outcomes offer more consistent responses. Our results involving CPA and social preferences complement previous work which employ measures of cognitive ability which are sensitive to the intrinsic motivation of the subject. Our results involving SAT scores are without precedent in the literature and suggest that measures of cognitive ability, which are less sensitive to the intrinsic motivation of the subject, are positively related to generosity.

We consider a data set of exports from individual US states to foreign countries and combine it with trade flows between and within US states. After controlling for distance and country size, we estimate that relative to state-to-state trade, crossing an individual US state's domestic border appears to entail a larger trade barrier than crossing the international US border. Due to the absence of governmental impediments to trade within the United States, this result is surprising.

From an orthodox perspective, we suggest that this unemployment is the result of a highly inflexible labor market, which needs to be reformed by introducing flexibility measures. The paper argues, however, that labor market reforms introduced since the early 1980s, allowing an excessive use of temporary employment contracts, have had perverse effects on the Spanish economy. They have affected negatively not only aggregate demand and supply, but also income distribution. The emergence of these market reforms helps explain the current rate of unemployment as well as the deep impact of the global financial crisis on overall Spanish economic activity.","[Ferreiro, Jesus; Serrano, Felipe] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Ferreiro, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ 5, Bilbao, Spain.",,"Ferreiro, Jesus/J-3556-2019; Serrano, Felipe/X-9303-2019","Ferreiro, Jesus/0000-0002-5732-7966; Serrano, Felipe/0000-0002-5993-7178",,,,,27,9,9,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In a first step, the pass-through estimates are derived from a dynamic panel data model through the generalized method of moments. A statistically significant exchange rate pass-through to consumer, producer and import prices is found, both in the short and long run. In a second step, I proceed to an individual analysis, country by country, and find support for an increased heterogeneity in the exchange rate pass-through estimates. In a third step, I assess the drivers of the estimated exchange rate pass-through coefficients and find support for a significant impact of exchange rate volatility, inflation volatility, import dependence, and the output gap, as well as the global outlook.

Given the magnitude of the contribution of food waste to global environmental change, it is surprising that this issue has not received greater attention. The measures reduce the amount of food the restaurants need to purchase, and there is no change in guest satisfaction, making it likely that profits will increase.

In our model, speculators form their expectations about the future appreciation premium adaptively by extrapolating past appreciation returns into the future. We find that a rapid appreciation may attract more capital inflows, and the central bank may prefer a slow appreciation to discourage capital inflows. Simulated results can generate hump-shaped paths of the appreciation speed, expected appreciation premium, and capital inflows. In addition, changes in the appreciation speed precede changes in the expected appreciation premium and capital inflows. These results are consistent with empirical evidence in the 2005-2008 renminbi appreciation episode. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a theory of a streaming music business model consisting of two types of services provided by a monopolist. The first service, which offers access free of charge, is of low quality and financed by advertising. The second service charges its users and is of high quality. The analysis demonstrates that if users are highly tolerant of commercials, the monopolist benefits from advertising funding and hence charges a high price to users of the fee-based service to boost demand for the advertising supported service. The analysis addresses the welfare consequences of such a business model and shows it is an effective policy for combating digital piracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of a strong countercyclical trade policy response in the pre-Great Recession period of 1988:Q1-2008:Q3 during which increases in domestic unemployment rates, real appreciations in bilateral exchange rates, and declines in the GDP growth rates of bilateral trading partners led to substantial increases in new temporary trade barriers. We then apply this pre-Great Recession empirical model to realized macroeconomic data from 2008:Q4 to 2010:Q4 and find that it predicts a surge of new import protection during the Great Recession - e.g., for the US and EU, the model predicts that new trade barriers would cover an additional 15 percentage points of nonoil imports, well above the baseline level of 2-3% of import coverage immediately preceding the crisis. Finally, we examine why the realized trade policy response differed from model predictions. While exchange rate movements played an important role in limiting new import protection during the Great Recession, we provide evidence of one particularly important change in trade policy responsiveness; i.e., in this period, governments refrained from imposing new temporary trade barriers against foreign trading partners experiencing their own weak or negative economic growth.

Although the oil exporting countries are among the most energy-intensive economies in the world, little attention has been paid to the features of their energy consumption. Therefore, this study empirically investigates the two variables dynamic relationship in 12 oil exporting countries from 1990 to 2010. Using recently developed panel econometric techniques, the present paper accounts for cross-section dependence and structural breaks when analysing the energy-income nexus. The results of this study indicate that there exists a long-run equilibrium relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. Furthermore, the empirical evidence of a dynamic panel error-correction model reveals a short-run unidirectional causality from energy consumption to economic growth, whereas in the long-run, it is the economic process that determines the energy consumption trend.

I show that the use of red tape - a wasteful application process - can achieve de-facto discrimination. Key to this result is firm heterogeneity since, although the red tape cost is the same across firms, only those sufficiently benefiting from an incentive program will find it worth the cost of applying. If the benefits of targeting subsidies outweigh the burden of red tape, red tape will be used. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We incorporate this observation into a life-cycle continuous time overlapping-generations model of consumption/saving with a general form for a subjective survival function. Resulting time-inconsistent optimal control problem has been analytically solved. At the micro level, time inconsistency leads to higher consumption at young and old ages, but this alone fails to improve lifetime well-being since micro-level decisions made with a lack of information about true mortality are suboptimal. In general equilibrium, however, such time inconsistent behavior with survival misperception is conducive to aggregate capital accumulation and greater equilibrium bequest income. The latter effects can produce substantial welfare gains. We also note that empirically observed old age optimistic bias is an important phenomenon, as it helps to avoid unrealistic very old-age debt accumulation within a life-cycle model. In addition, if for a given level of optimistic bias we increase early-life pessimism, this would result in slower capital accumulation, lower bequest income, and thus be detrimental to welfare. Since recent literature reports that young-age survival pessimism has grown over time, it raises some concerns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between household saving and various socio-economic and demographic variables is analyzed by applying Johansen cointegration analysis. Furthermore, Error Correction Model is also estimated in order to find out the convergence of the model towards equilibrium. The results show that there exists a long run relationship between household saving and the variables used in the study, while the result of Error Correction Model reveals that about 45% convergence towards equilibrium takes place every year.

We then characterize this optimal tax schedule. If sectoral inputs are complements, a many-sector model with self-selection leads to optimal income taxes that are less progressive than the corresponding taxes in a standard single-sector model under natural conditions.

They are mostly spent on decoupled direct payments which are intended to be allocatively neutral. Increasing volumes of such transfers imply that distributive aspects of CAP expenditures become more important. This article looks at this issue by calculating various measures of concentration based on statistics on recipients of direct payments in EU27 in the period from 2000 to 2010. The findings are evaluated in the context of the objectives of the CAP and the reform proposals of the EU Commission from October 2011.

We find that product market demand shocks have significant and quantitatively large effects on employment. This supports a model with imperfect competition in the product market. We find no evidence that the level of unemployment in the local labour market has a direct effect on job creation in existing firms.

We make two contributions. The first is expositional-to show that their model of a liquidity crisis can be represented as a two-equation dynamic system in K (the aggregate capital stock) and q (Tobin's q, the price of capital goods) with saddle-point dynamics. This allows for an intuitive, graphical exposition of the issues and results. The second is to show how a liquidity crisis leads to a deep recession when the assumption of perfect wage and price flexibility is replaced by downwardly rigid wages and prices. As in Del Negro et al., we show how central bank policies to increase liquidity can ameliorate the recession: but we use our simplified model for the purpose. Further, we analyse how fiscal intervention can help combat recession.","[Driffill, John] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ Math & Stat, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Miller, Marcus] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of Warwick,"Driffill, J (通讯作者)，Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",jdriffill@bbk.ac.uk,"Miller, Marcus/A-2123-2009",,"ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-156-34-1001, ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,46,4,4,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Pay and working time data cover adult male blue-collar workers within engineering and metal working firms. We attempt to tackle the problem of countercyclical aggregation bias linked to workforce composition by distinguishing between pieceworkers and timeworkers who are broken down into 14 occupations and 51 travel-to-work engineering districts. We test for the likely effects on our estimates of within-occupation heterogeneity. For pieceworkers we find significant, though modest, real hourly wage procyclicality. Timeworkers' real hourly wages are found to be acyclical. Due to procyclical fluctuations in weekly hours, the real weekly pay of both pieceworkers and timeworkers are strongly procyclical. We compare hourly and weekly pay outcomes with findings based on more recent micro data.","[Hart, Robert A.; Roberts, J.

The result is a macroeconomic model that allows for the endogenous development of business cycles and stock price bubbles. We show that market sentiments exert important influence on the macroeconomy: Impulse-response functions of macroeconomic variables become more volatile which makes the effect of a given shock hard to predict. We also analyze the impact of different types of financial transaction taxes that are currently debated among policy makers (FTT, FAT, progressive FAT) and find that such taxes are well suited to stabilize the economy and raise funds from the financial sector as a contribution to the enormous costs created during the recent crisis. Our simulations suggest that the FTT leads to higher tax revenues and better stabilization results then the FAT. However, the FTT might also create huge distortion if set too high, a threat which the FAT does not imply.","[Lengnick, Matthias; Wohltmann, Hans-Werner] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Lengnick, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",lengnick@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,68,37,38,1,51,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

The first kind of irreversibility concerns the sunk cost of environmental degradation; the second is related to the sunk cost of environmental policy. Clearly, the two irreversibilities pull in opposite directions: policy irreversibility leads to more pollution and a less/later policy, while environmental irreversibility generates less pollution and a more/sooner policy. Using a real option approach and an infinite time horizon model, this paper considers both irreversibilities simultaneously. The model first is developed by paying particular attention to the option values related to pollution and policy adoption. The environmental policy we consider consists in increasing the natural assimilation rate. Solving the model in closed form then provides solutions for both the optimal pollution level and the optimal environmental policy timing. Finally, we provide a numerical example with the purpose of appraising which irreversibility has the prevailing effect and what is the overall impact of both irreversibilities on pollution and policy timing.","[Pommeret, Aude] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pommeret, Aude] IREGE Univ Savoie, Savoie, France; [Prieur, Fabien] INRA, Paris, France; [Prieur, Fabien] Univ Montpellier I, F-34006 Montpellier, France",University of Lausanne; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc; INRAE; Universite de Montpellier,"Pommeret, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",aude.pommeret@univ-savoie.fr; prieur@supagro.inra.fr,"PRIEUR, Fabien/AAT-9498-2020","POMMERET, Aude/0000-0002-9160-2095; Prieur, Fabien/0000-0002-6651-304X",,,,,21,3,3,0,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The results suggest that monetary institutions matter for wage formation. Real wages are on average higher under inflation targeting, in particular in economies with highly coordinated or centralized wage setting. This finding is in line with the strand of literature arguing that a liberal central bank may be more conducive to wage restraint than a conservative central bank if unions are inflation averse. Our results thus lend no support to the popular deterrence hypothesis. While inflation targeting seems to matter for wage formation, we find no evidence of effects on unemployment.

This paper applies a multi-sector dynamic, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to estimate the impacts of the BTAs implemented by the US and EU on China's sectoral carbon emissions. The results indicate that BTAs will decrease export prices and transmit the effects to the whole economy, affecting sectoral output and demand from both the supply side and demand side. On the supply side sectors might move away from exporting towards the domestic market, thereby increasing sectoral supply, while on the demand side, the domestic income may be strikingly cut down due to the decrease in export price, decreasing sectoral demand. Furthermore, such shrinkage of demand may similarly reduce energy prices, which would lead to an energy substitution effect and somewhat stimulate carbon emissions. Depending on the relative strength of the output-demand effect and energy substitution effect, sectoral carbon emissions and energy demands will vary across sectors, with increases, decreases or shifts in different directions. These results suggest that an incentive mechanism to encourage the widespread use of environment-friendly fuels and technologies will be more effective than BTAs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Before 1989 Czechoslovakia was a communist state with a centrally planned economy. In November 1989 the Velvet Revolution restored democracy in the country and on 1 January 1993 Czechoslovakia split into two countries: the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (Slovakia). The poverty phenomenon began to be publicly discussed in the former Czechoslovakia after November 1989. Before 1989 accepting the existence of poverty was contrary to the communist ideological principle of equality, and socio-economic research on it was even prohibited. The term poverty was replaced by restricted consumption capability'. This article briefly describes the history of attempts to measure poverty prior to the split. Further detailed analyses are focused on monetary poverty, relative material deprivation and subjective perception of poverty in the two countries and are based on EUSILC 200608 microdata, i.e. 15 years after the split. Differences among the countries are then discussed.","[Bartosova, Jitka] Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Zelinsky, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia; [Zelinsky, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Technical University Kosice; Charles University Prague,"Bartosová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",bartosov@fm.vse.cz,"Zelinsky, Tomas/D-1539-2010","Zelinsky, Tomas/0000-0001-7198-0278; Bartosova, Jitka/0000-0003-1416-8958",,,,,34,37,37,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,MAR 1,2013,25.0,1,,,,,119,131,,10.1080/14631377.2013.756704,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,083GU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000314451900007,0

Under fairly mild assumptions, if households are heterogeneous and resale of goods can occur, transitional policy reform creates losers (state employees) as well as winners (non-state employees).

This research examines the reasons underpinning the lack of widespread adoption, via duration analysis, correlating the speed of adoption of Mirte and Lakech cook stoves - two examples of new cooking technologies - in urban Ethiopia to socioeconomic factors. According to the duration analysis, adoption rates have steadily increased over time, while economic factors, such as product price, household income and household wealth, are, for the most part, important determinants of adoption behavior.

We want to test if the interest rate is conducive to financial stability. Our empirical results show that the effectiveness of the short-term interest rate in affecting selected asset prices depends on monetary policy strategy. In the case of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania, the interest rate instrument used for inflation targeting is conducive to financial stability. Among countries with a fixed exchange rate regime, only in Bulgaria does transmission of the foreign interest rate impulse to domestic variables promote financial stability. Additionally, our results show that in Latvia and Lithuania adjustments to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) are not in accordance with country-specific conditions. The paper contributes to a policy debate on the design of macro-prudential polices in the aftermath of the boom-bust cycle experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries in the second half of the last decade.","[Cocris, Vasile; Nucu, Anca Elena] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Cocris, V (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B Dul Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",vcocris@uaic.ro; nucu.anca@yahoo.com,"Nucu, Anca/AAU-7713-2020",,,,,,21,9,9,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

I create a dataset containing more than 4000 unique Yemeni local tribes and study their relationship with the public provision of educational goods. I demonstrate that areas with greater tribal heterogeneity receive larger allocations of publicly provided teachers and classrooms; I find evidence that this result reflects tribes' roles in influencing both political patronage from the state and targeted development transfers from development donors. This result, while different from most previous studies, reflects the nature of the publicly provided good being studied which is locally excludable precisely along the local tribal lines used for calculating heterogeneity. These results may offer generalizable insight into a variety of other developing country contexts where access to publicly provided goods is controlled or influenced by local groups.

It focuses on those aspects of policy that Labour itself highlighted in its manifestos, such as the raising of educational standards. A major issue, particularly on the issue of standards, is the methodological weaknesses of the statistics used. No firm conclusion can be drawn on whether standards rose or not: they probably merely kept pace with those in other countries. However, Labour clearly put more resources into education than the previous Conservative administrations had done. There is also evidence of increased participation in post-compulsory (1618) education, and Labour policies probably contributed towards this. There is also evidence of narrowing inequalities in achievement at the end of compulsory schooling. Conversely, the introduction of fees for higher education does not appear to have made inequalities worse. On balance, then, education represents a modest success for New Labour, although the biggest story is really the over-claiming from both sides about their respective successes and failures and the poor quality and lack of commensurability over time of the statistical data.","[Heath, Anthony] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Sullivan, Alice] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Boliver, Vikki] Univ Durham, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Zimdars, Anna] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of Oxford; University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; Durham University; University of London; King's College London,"Heath, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",anthony.heath@nuffield.ox.ac.uk; a.sullivan@ioe.ac.uk; vikki.boliver@durham.ac.uk; anna.zimdars@kcl.ac.uk,,"Boliver, Vikki/0000-0002-5629-5544",,,,,41,13,16,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We found that the real option value of waiting to invest in graduate school education will decrease when the expected wage rate of labors with an undergraduate degree becomes relatively lower than that with a graduate degree. As a result, more undergraduate students will decide to go to graduate schools immediately after graduation. As the supply of labors with a graduate degree increases and the job creations fail to meet the increasing demand, those who cannot get a graduate-level job will be willing to accept job offers lower than their education level. Our modified Harris-Todaro model shows that it will lead to an increase in the number of unemployed and underemployed higher educated labors. This explains why the unemployment rates for higher educated labor are relatively high in some developed countries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

I survey three sets of data that are relevant to answering this question: impact studies of teacher merit-pay schemes, evidence on teacher attitudes to merit pay, and surveys of attitudes in the general public to merit pay. Looking at the existing merit-pay plans, one is struck by the fact that their incentive schemes are often very complicated, and most estimates are of short-run effects (so do not capture selection into the teaching profession). Teacher attitudes are mixed, with new teachers more open to merit pay than their more experienced colleagues. Teachers are particularly hostile to merit-pay schemes based on test scores, raising a particular challenge for the political sustainability of such plans.

Our questionnaire elicits information on expenditures on magico-religious diagnosis, prevention and treatment in the 12 months prior to our survey. Far from being anecdotal, our data show that out of the 178 households in our sample, 48% have declared some magico-religious expenditures. For these household heads, these expenditures represented on average 5.6% of all expenditures. Using an econometric analysis, we test several conjectures that can be found in the relevant literature as to what variables drive magico-religious expenditures.

This paper seeks to provide elements for a contemporary resumption of such Veblenian elaborations. Thus, we aim to re-establish the dialogue between economics and biology, focusing on the historical and methodological spheres of the conversation. The first part of the paper demonstrates that evolutionary biology's analysis of the pre-Darwinian past relies on the same principles that Veblen used to build his criticism of neoclassical economics - namely, the principles of typology. The paper also shows how this approach had a negative impact on the theoretical elaborations of pre-Darwinian biology, and how it contributed to the problematic foundations of neoclassical economics. The paper further focuses on the key methodological principles of Charles Darwin's works, highlighting their importance beyond the field of biology, and pointing out that a Darwinian approach constitutes an ontological perspective, premised on what Geoffrey Hodgson and Thorbjorn Knudsen denote as generalized Darwinism. Finally, the paper discusses certain concepts in the general theoretical debate of Darwinian ontology to stress the revolutionary role of Charles Darwin as a founder of this perspective and to explore the relationship between the ontological perspective and biological analogy.","[Souza Luz, Manuel R.; Fracalanza, Paulo S.] Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, IE, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Luz, MRS (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, UNICAMP, IE, Campinas, Brazil.",,"Souza Luz, Manuel Ramon/CAJ-3470-2022; Kim, Soohyun/N-6460-2014; Fracalanza, Paulo/D-9855-2013","Fracalanza, Paulo Sergio/0000-0002-8395-981X",,,,,54,1,2,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Yet, very little is known about its size and characteristics. We present novel estimates for 50 African countries and show that the private sector accounts for about two thirds of total investments, four fifths of total consumption and three fourths of total credit. Countries with small private sectors include a sample of oil exporters and some of the poorest countries in the continent. Surprisingly, the size of the private sector does not appear to be significantly correlated with growth performance. Labour market data reinforce the idea of a large private sector, which provides about 90% of total employment opportunities. However, most of this labour is informal and characterised by low productivity: permanent wage jobs in the private sector account on average for only 10% of total employment. South Africa is the notable exception, with formal wage employment in the private sector representing 46% of total employment. Finally, we find evidence of negative private sector earning premiums (13% on the average), suggesting that market distortions abound. These are likely to prevent the efficient allocation of human resources and to reduce the overall productivity of the African economies.","[Stampini, Marco] Interamer Dev Bank, Social Protect & Hlth Div, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Diarra, Setou M.] Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",Inter-American Development Bank; Laval University,"Stampini, M (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Social Protect & Hlth Div, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",mstampini@iadb.org,"Stampini, Marco/GVT-9917-2022",,,,,,8,7,8,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Generally, the empirical results suggest weak links of these economies to the US contrary to a-priori expectations. Only the GDP of Taiwan has a long-run relationship with the USA. Though Granger causal links from the USA to Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan exist, they are projected as weak by the impulse response functions. Co-integration and short-run causal links with the USA are ruled out in the case of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Contemporaneous correlations of output growth shocks merely exist between the USA on one hand and Indonesia and Taiwan on the other. Hence, all this would suggest that these East Asian economies are generally in a position to grow quite independently of the USA, barring a global economic crisis. Nevertheless, they should strive for greater resilience by raising domestic consumption so that they need not always count on countercyclical macroeconomic policy measures to provide a buffer against external shocks.","[Tan, Eu Chye; Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tan, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",tanec@um.edu.my,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,18,2,2,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In so doing, I provide an alternative discussion to that of some current institutionalists who propose to replace the existing OIE definitions of institution(s) with consensual definitions developed in the discourse with non-OIE traditions. I propose that there is still considerable analytical value in the OIE definitions, and that replacing them with non-OIE-originating concepts would unnecessarily carry OIE away from its methodological and philosophical roots.

We sourced primary SUT and inputoutput tables from Eurostat and non-EU statistical offices. We harmonized and detailed them using auxiliary national accounts data and co-efficient matrices. Imports were allocated to countries of exports using United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database trade shares. Optimization procedures removed imbalances in these detailing and trade linking steps. Environmental extensions were added from various sources. We calculated the EU footprint of final consumption with resulting MR EE SUT. EU policies focus mainly on energy and carbon footprints. We show that the EU land, water, and material footprint abroad is much more relevant, and should be prioritized in the EU's environmental product and trade policies.","[Tukker, Arnold; Kuenen, Jeroen] Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res TNO, Delft, Netherlands; [de Koning, Arjan] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Leiden, Netherlands; [Tukker, Arnold; Wood, Richard; Hawkins, Troy] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Program, Trondheim, Norway; [Lutter, Stephan] Sustainable Europe Res Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Acosta, Jose] Wuppertal Inst, Wuppertal, Germany; [Rueda Cantuche, Jose M.] EU DG JRC Inst Prospect Technol Studies IPTS, Seville, Spain; [Bouwmeester, Maaike; Oosterhaven, Jan] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Drosdowski, Thomas] GWS, Osnabruck, Germany",Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Groningen,"Tukker, A (通讯作者)，Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res TNO, Delft, Netherlands.",arnold.tukker@tno.nl,"Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015; Lutter, Stephan/AAD-1881-2019; Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021; de Koning, Arjan/K-8162-2013; Tukker, Arnold/M-4596-2013","Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Tukker, Arnold/0000-0002-8229-2929; Lutter, Stephan/0000-0003-0097-7535",,,,,67,264,274,3,92,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

This paper argues that the high housing prices are partly caused by some real factors, including the policy of restricting land uses, in particular the maintenance of a minimum overall agricultural acreage. A simple model of three sectors (housing, agriculture, and others) is constructed to examine the effects of the artificial constraint. The role of increasing returns in the non-agricultural sectors in exacerbating the policy biases is also examined. The model is then calibrated to estimate the effects of land use control policy on housing prices in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The model which guides our analysis is the International Asset Pricing Model (IAPM). Portfolios of the 18 EU countries investigated by us turn out to become more similar over time.

These findings suggest that standardization in malpractice law may lead to greater standardization in practices and, more generally, that physicians may indeed adhere to specific liability standards.

Variants have been used by regulators in the airline and wireless communications industries, among others. A typical stated objective is to limit capacity hoarding, thereby increasing aggregate output and welfare. When the dominant firm is more efficient than fringe firms, we find that imposing a use-or-lose provision induces the dominant firm to acquire capacity from the fringe, which causes aggregate output to fall. When the dominant firm is less efficient than the fringe, aggregate output rises. In both cases, total surplus may rise or fall.

The model's answer to the first question is yes it can, but the effect is only temporary and probably not welfare enhancing. The answer to the second question is more complicated because it depends on policy. It also depends on whether it is the inflation rate or the real interest rate that will adjust over the longer run if the policy rate is held near zero for an extended period. We use the Fisher equation to analyze possible outcomes for situations where the central bank has promised to keep the interest rate near zero for an extended period.","[Gavin, William T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Keen, Benjamin D.] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Gavin, WT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, POB 442, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",gavin@stls.frb.org,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This differs from the standard argument that publicly financed education increases the total amount of human capital by equalizing educational opportunities.

The forecasts of growth in nondurable spending are equally accurate in predicting the downward and upward moves and are thus of value when policymakers assign similar cost to both incorrect downward and upward predictions. Utilizing survey data to measure the private forecasts, we further provide partial support for the asymmetric information hypothesis that the Federal Reserve has useful information about the state of the economy that is not known by the public.","Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Management, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Baghestani, H (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Management, POB 26666, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",baghesta@msn.com,,"Baghestani, Hamid/0000-0003-4568-1682",,,,,20,11,11,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The population of the research included all employees of Islamic Azad University (administrative region 11) in Iran. 203 employees were selected using stratified and cluster random sampling. The research instruments were two questionnaires which were administered in 13 branches and education centers: Beugre's (1998) organizational justice questionnaire which consisted of 20 items with three underlying constructs of procedural justice, interactional justice, and distributive justice and Cronbach Alpha of 0.93 and Bontis's (1997) intellectual capital questionnaire which consisted of 52 items with three underlying constructs of human capital, customer capital, and structural capital and Cronbach Alpha of 0.89. The results of path analysis using LISREL software indicated that dimensions of intellectual capital had a direct effect on organizational justice with the indices of 0.73. The model also showed that the factor of customer capital in intellectual capital had the highest direct effect on the factor of procedural justice in organizational justice.

A player is event-rational if she best responds to a conjecture and uses a list of subsets of the other players' strategies to break ties among outcome-equivalent strategies. Using type spaces to capture interactive beliefs, we show that event-rationality and common belief of event-rationality (RCBER) imply S-infinity W, the set of admissible strategies that survive iterated elimination of dominated strategies. By strengthening standard belief to validated belief, we show that event-rationality and common validated belief of event-rationality (RCvBER) imply IA, the iterated admissible strategies.

In addition, the realized values are also private information. We characterize a class of environments in which the profit-maximizing long-term contract offered by a monopolist takes an especially simple structure: we derive sufficient conditions on primitives under which the optimal contract consists of a menu of deterministic sequences of static contracts. Within each sequence, higher realized values lead to greater quantity provision; however, an increasing proportion of buyer types are excluded over time, eventually leading to inefficiently early termination of the relationship. Moreover, the menu choices differ by future generosity, with more costly (up front) plans guaranteeing greater quantity provision in the future. Thus, the seller screens process information in the initial period and then progressively screens across realized values so as to reduce the information rents paid in future periods.","[Boleslavsky, Raphael] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Said, Maher] Washington Univ, John M Olin Sch Business, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Miami; Washington University (WUSTL),"Boleslavsky, R (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,"Said, Maher/C-3208-2012",,,,,,42,29,31,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We use these wedges to show that the average tariff rate of 46% in 1933 substantially understated the true impact of the Smoot-Hawley (SH) tariff structure, which we estimate to be equivalent to a uniform tariff rate of 70%. We use these wedges to. calculate the impact of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs on total factor productivity and welfare. In our benchmark parameterization, we find that tariff protection reduced TFP by 1.2% relative to free trade prior to the Smoot-Hawley legislation. TFP fell by an additional 0.5% between 1930 and 1933 due to Smoot-Hawley. We also conduct counterfactual policy exercises and examine the sensitivity of our results to changes in the elasticity of substitution and the import share. A doubling of the substitution elasticities yields a TFP decline of almost 5% relative to free trade, with an additional reduction due to SH of 0.4%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Are the decisions of domestic investors to invest abroad or of foreign investors to cut off funds from the domestic economy governed by the same set of determinants? Given the distribution of different types of sudden stop episodes over time and its different macroeconomic consequences, we argue that their determinants may not be alike. One of the novel aspects of this paper is to characterize sudden stops in capital flows (frequency, consequences and determinants) using quarterly data on gross flows for a wide array of countries from 1975 to 2010. We find that foreign investors are less likely to stop bringing capital when the domestic economy is growing and its performance is leveraged by positive external shocks. Domestic agents, on the other hand, are more willing to invest abroad if there are high external savings (current account surpluses), especially in natural-resource abundant countries. Rising financial openness makes the domestic country more vulnerable to sudden stops caused by either local or global investors. Finally, rising risk aversion in world capital markets tend to reduce the likelihood of outflow-driven stops-which may signal a larger propensity towards capital repatriation by domestic investors.

Underuse is even more difficult to explain in countries like Italy where preventive care can be obtained for free. In this article we investigate the determinants of prevention underuse with an empirical model based on human capital theory which also includes three factors to which little attention has been paid so far: role played by the General Practitioner (GP), nonmonetary barriers to access and health beliefs. We apply a recursive probit model explaining both recourse to prevention and to the GP which allows us to adequately measure the effect of the latter on the former and to quantitatively compare the determinants of curative and preventive care. We find that the GP plays a minor role in prevention use but that nonmonetary barriers to access and health beliefs are strong determinants of preventive care demand.

It deals with part of the aim of the project: the use of competitive strategies and competitive advantages among companies in the Czech part of Euroregion Nisa. Methodological approaches to the topics of competitive strategies and the competitive environment from the perspective of experts on the matter are presented in the Introduction to the paper. The main aim of the paper is to identify competitive strategies, primarily from the perspective of individual branches of industry and the size of a company, because it cannot be said that there is one and the same strategy for all types of company. it is in the Interests of each and every company to determine what its best competitive advantage is in light of the situation on the market, the aims it has set for itself or its opportunities and resources. A well-chosen competitive strategy provides the chance to place a product on the market in the best way possible in relation to what other companies have to offer. The authors of the paper deal with the issue of the main competitive strategies that companies now use and in what lies their competitive advantage. Results and discussion are found in an evaluation of primary research undertaken among 170 companies in the Czech part of Euroregion Nisa. A detailed investigation confirmed that competitive advantage and competitive strategies need to be understood as multi-dimensional and multi-factored. It can be contended that successful companies need to produce differentiated products at low cost and have to be flexible.","[Dedkova, Jaroslava; Folprecht, Michal] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,jaroslava.dedkova@tul.cz; michal.folprecht@tul.cz,"Dědková, Jaroslava/HLP-4960-2023","Dědková, Jaroslava/0000-0002-1560-9973",,,,,10,2,2,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,114,124,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300012,0

This paper develops a structural model to identify the sources of this local currency price stability and applies it to micro-data from the beer market. The empirical procedure exploits manufacturers' and retailers' first-order conditions in conjunction with detailed information on the frequency of price adjustments following exchange rate changes to quantify the relative importance of local non-traded cost components, markup adjustment by manufacturers and retailers, and nominal price rigidities in the incomplete transmission of such changes to prices. We find that, on average, approximately 60% of the incomplete exchange rate pass-through is due to local non-traded costs; 8% to markup adjustment; 30% to the existence of own brand price adjustment costs; and 1% to the indirect/strategic effect of such costs, though these results vary considerably across individual brands according to their market shares.","[Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou] BREAD, Cambridge, MA USA; [Hellerstein, Rebecca] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Goldberg, PK (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,,,,,,,43,83,89,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We base our analysis on a predictive regression framework, using monthly data covering the in-sample period between 1990:01 and 1996:12, and the out-of sample period commencing from 1997:01 to 2010:06. For the in-sample test, we use the t-statistic corresponding to the slope coefficient of the predictive regression model, and for the out-of-sample tests we employ the MSE-F and the ENC-NEW test statistics. When using multiple variables in a predictive regression model, the results become susceptible to data mining. To guard against this, we employ a bootstrap procedure to construct critical values that account for data mining. Further, we use a procedure that combines the in-sample general-to-specific model selection with tests of out-of-sample forecasting ability to examine the significance of each macro variable in explaining the stock returns behaviour. In addition, we use a diffusion index approach by extracting a principal component from the macro variables, and test the predictive power thereof. For the in-sample tests, our results show that different interest rate variables, world oil production growth, as well as, money supply have some predictive power at certain short-horizons. For the out-of-sample forecasts, only interest rates and money supply show short-horizon predictability. Further, the inflation rate shows very strong out-of-sample predictive power from 6-month-ahead horizons. A real time analysis based on a subset of variables that underwent revisions, resulted in deterioration of the predictive power of these variables compared to the fully revised data available for 2010:6. The diffusion index yields statistically significant results for only four specific months over the out-of-sample horizon. When accounting for data mining, both the in-sample and the out-of-sample test statistics for both the individual regressions and the diffusion index become insignificant at all horizons. The general-to-specific model confirms the importance of different interest rate variables in explaining the behaviour of stock returns, despite their inability to predict stock returns, when accounting for data mining.

We find that doubling the number of county governments in a metropolitan area leads to a 17% increase in the average annual growth rate of earnings per employee over 1969-2006, and a 10% increase in 2006 income per employee. Decomposing income effects using 2000 Census worker-level data, we find that approximately half of the effect stems from making workers more productive, while the other half comes from changing the composition of the workforce and inducing workers to work more hours. We also present evidence that inter-jurisdictional competition leads local governments to raise more in taxes, spend more, and issue more debt (per capita), but does not help them obtain more inter-governmental transfers. However, the additional cost from this increase in expenditures to a median-wage employee is much smaller than the increase in that employee's wages due to greater inter-jurisdictional competition.

Therefore, we introduce hiring costs and strategic wage bargaining. The interaction between these two modifications limits the impact of both channels effectively and persistently.

The main object of the paper is to analyze their strategic decision-making process on theoretical and practical level and through a synthesis of the knowledge to highlight the dominant model of strategic decision-making process in researched enterprises and the mechanisms used by managers of these enterprises in the strategic decision making in today's business environment.","[Jankelova, Nadezda; Hudakova, Ivana Misunova; Misun, Juraj] Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Podnikoveho Manazmentu, Katedra Manazmentu, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Misún, J (通讯作者)，Ekon Univ Bratislave, Fak Podnikoveho Manazmentu, Katedra Manazmentu, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",jankelov@euba.sk; hudakova@euba.sk; misun@euba.sk,"Jankelová, Nadežda/AAS-5404-2020; Hudáková, Ivana Mišúnová/AAK-6589-2021; Misun, Juraj/AAW-5042-2020","Jankelová, Nadežda/0000-0002-0045-4737; Hudáková, Ivana Mišúnová/0000-0001-8417-9762; Misun, Juraj/0000-0002-1586-1351",,,,,34,4,4,0,12,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Prices in a dynamic duopolistic market can be more rigid than those in more competitive markets, such as a monopolistic-competition market. Therefore, the estimates of menu costs under monopolistic competition are potentially biased upward due to the price rigidity from strategic interactions between dynamic duopolistic firms. By developing and estimating a dynamic discrete-choice model with duopoly to correct for this potential bias, this paper provides empirical evidence that dynamic strategic interactions, as well as menu costs, play an important role in explaining the observed degree of price rigidity in weekly retail prices.

Activities leading to innovations are costly and very risky. Companies are therefore looking for stable environment for their activities. Stable environment can be provided by quality institutions, which includes: conditions for starting a business (so-called start-up), clear and transparent rules when dealing with public administration, investor protection, tax burden, low corruption, competence of public administration and its integrity, equal access to information etc. Nevertheless, the main stream economy ignores more or less the influence of institutions and abstracts transaction costs, thus getting trapped when it is unable to explain why traditional instruments and approaches of neoclassic economy in development schemes often do not contribute to sustainable development.

Chandrasekhar and Lewis (2011) show that the estimation with sampled networks could be biased due to measurement error induced by sampling and propose a bias correction by restricting the estimation to sampled nodes to avoid measurement error in the regressors. However, measurement error may still exist in the instruments and thus induce the weak instrument problem when the sampling rate is low. For a local-aggregate model, we show that the instrument based on the outdegrees of sampled nodes is free of measurement error and thus remains informative even if the sampling rate is low. Simulation studies suggest that the 2SLS estimator with the proposed instrument works well when the sampling rate is low and the other instruments are weak. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Its importance, and the value of putting it into the hands of stakeholders, has led to an increase in studies that propose models that try to measure and evaluate intellectual capital and has led to businesses applying and even publishing these studies as non-financial information. In this sense, several lines of study have appeared that find it is good to disseminate its existence in a business through intellectual capital reports, Integrated Reports and through calls for greater improvement in a business' financial information to adequately reflect these types of intangibles and satisfy the requirements of the users of this information. However, conceptual accounting frameworks contain some requirements to include these types of intangibles in financial statements. These requirements can be difficult to meet since there are authors and professionals who warn that this kind of financial information can make financial statements lose their relevance. We can consider the fact that the JOBS Act in the U.S., as well as the Proposal of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council(1) both call for the reduction in the informational demands of SME's financial statements is another limitation to the greater improvement of financial information. We have observed two positions. On one hand, the call to amplify financial information to include aspects like the intangibles that are currently excluded but that are very relevant for stakeholders, for which more complete and detailed models and reports are proposed. On the other hand, a call to reduce the extent of the information required in financial statements is made and justified on the grounds of the related costs that SMEs must incur in terms of the cost/benefit relationship that this financial information provides. Our research, built on the resource-based and dynamic capabilities theories, attempts to shed some light on the fact that, once again, the utility of the information contained in accounting or financial statements is being examined. To do this we analyse if the financial information contained in SME's statements is not only important but also that when this information is taken into account with other, non-financial information it provides a way to measure the effect of innovation. This type of intangible information allows SMEs to attain greater earnings and creates greater chances of survival, especially within an economic crisis environment, which can be considered to be very relevant for stakeholders. Nowadays, we are conducting the analysis of the results of the research.","[Lopez Fernandez, Jose Manuel; Somohano Rodriguez, Francisco Manuel; Martinez Garcia, Francisco Javier] Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Fernández, JML (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",josemanuel.lopez@unican.es; fm.somohano@unican.es; francisco.martinez@unican.es,"López-Fernández, José Manuel/ITT-5011-2023; Somohano, Paco/HKV-8911-2023; Somohano-Rodríguez, Francisco M./ISA-2034-2023; Moreno, Jose/HKW-2517-2023","Somohano-Rodríguez, Francisco M./0000-0003-4628-999X;",,,,,70,0,0,2,18,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,523,531,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000060,0

Existing tendencies towards integration and globalization may have positive as well as negative consequences for national, regional and local economies. In times of prosperity, increased openness of the economy can accelerate economic growth. On the other hand, In times of crisis mutual dependence resulting from a more open economy might contribute to its vulnerability and a susceptibility to economic shocks. The latest economic crisis in particular has brought new challenges for national, regional as well as local economies in terms of their ability to recover from economic downturn that may derail them from their growth path. Regions should not only pay attention to developing their competitive advantages, but also to the long-term sustainability of their economic growth and their ability to respond to unexpected shocks. This paper discusses the major factors of regional economic resilience in the context of the increasing integration of the world's economies. Firstly, it provides a brief introduction to the concept of economic resilience and possible ways of measuring It as presented by a variety of experts In economics and regional studies. An analysis of the situation of the Czech regions at NUTS 3 level follows based on GDP and employment data. The sensitivity of regions to economic downturns within the last two economic crises in the Czech Republic is measured in terms of their effect on employment development.","[Lungova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,miroslava.lungova@tul.cz,,,,,,,13,3,3,0,13,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,363,371,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300038,0

The question of the appropriate fiscal policy is gaining recognition especially for the countries of the euro zone after entering the European Monetary Union (EMU). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the activity of the fiscal policy before and after the entrance to the euro zone for each individual EMU country in 1995-2010 period. For this purpose we will use the cyclical adjusted balance, which is the common tool used to estimate fiscal policy stance. The analysis of the cyclically adjusted balance gives an additional insight into the former activity arrangements of the fiscal policy, which contributes to gauge the ex-post estimation of the fiscal policy. On this base we can determine the causes of general government budgets imbalance in the past. Despite this fact, we should be aware of some caveats in the assessment of cyclical adjusted balance, which appear due the inconsistency in measurement of output gap and potential GDP growth. To evaluate pro-cyclical or countercyclical fiscal policy stance we compare the dynamic evaluation of the cyclically adjusted balance and output gap. Namely, changes of the cyclically adjusted balance in consecutive years indicate the orientation of fiscal policy, i.e. the fiscal impulse. By comparing the change in the cyclically adjusted balance and output gap between individual years, which indicates fluctuations in the economic cycle, it is possible to assess the orientation of fiscal policy, i.e. the fiscal position. The fiscal policy can be considered as countercyclical if it is expansive in the situation of negative output gap and restrictive in the situation, when the actual growth of GDP is above its potential rate. On the other hand, fiscal policy is characterized to be pro-cyclical if in the situation of negative output gap the government uses restrictive fiscal instruments and when the fiscal policy reacts expansionary in the situation of positive output gap, where the actual output exceeds the estimated potential GDP. In the empirical analysis we evaluate the fiscal policy stance for each country of the euro zone. In the assessment of government behaviour we cover 14 countries in the 1995-2010 period The results of the analysis generally confirm that the fiscal policy in most euro-zone member states became more expansionary in the period after entering the EMU. Moreover, these preliminary findings were partly confirmed by a statistical analysis which shows statistically significant differences in expansionary fiscal policy between the aforementioned sub-periods. In addition, we might also conclude the average fiscal stance is expansionary when actual output is above its potential level, which implies a pro-cyclical bias in times of prosperity, and that the fiscal stance tends to be predominantly counter-cyclical when actual output is below its potential level. These conclusions can be associated with asymmetric fiscal behaviour after entering the euro zone because the response of fiscal authorities to cyclical conditions in the economy depends on whether good or bad times are prevailing. These assertions reflect some conclusions made in other similar studies.","[Mencinger, Jernej; Aristovnik, Aleksander] Univ Ljubljana, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Mencinger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Gosarjeva St 5, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",jernej.mencinger@fu.uni-lj.si; aleksander.aristovnik@fu.uni-lj.si,"Aristovnik, Aleksander/B-4642-2010","Aristovnik, Aleksander/0000-0003-1345-9649",,,,,26,11,11,0,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Empirically they find that a woman is more likely to work if her mother-in-law worked than if her own mother worked. We confirm this intriguing result but demonstrate that there is also a link between the labor force participation choices of mothers and daughters. Further, in an alternative theoretical model we show that the relationship between the labor force participation of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law may be due instead to a woman's own preferences formed before selecting a spouse. Interestingly, the model demonstrates that the correlation in labor force status may be stronger for a mother-in-law/daughter-in-law pair than a mother/daughter pair, even if the preference formation channel is solely from mothers to daughters.

Sluggish price adjustment is a leading explanation for the large effects of demand shocks on output and, in particular, the effects of monetary policy on output. A recent influx of data on individual prices has greatly deepened macroeconomists' understanding of individual price dynamics. However, the analysis of these new data raises a host of new empirical issues that have not traditionally been confronted by parsimonious macroeconomic models of price setting. Simple statistics such as the frequency of price change may be misleading guides to the flexibility of the aggregate price level in a setting in which temporary sales, product churning, cross-sectional heterogeneity, and large idiosyncratic price movements play an important role. We discuss empirical evidence on these and other important features of micro price adjustment and ask how they affect the sluggishness of aggregate price adjustment and the economy's response to demand shocks.","[Nakamura, Emi] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Nakamura, Emi; Steinsson, Jon] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Nakamura, E (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",enakamura@columbia.edu; jsteinsson@columbia.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1056107] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,121,71,83,1,37,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4605-8,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

At present, the tax code does not allow families who provide this financial relief an income tax deduction, even though such relief is a gift to governments for exclusively public purposes and thus is analogous to a charitable donation. Using the Public Use Microdata Sample of the American Community Survey and the NBER Internet Taxsim calculator, this paper estimates that granting families who enroll their children in private schools an income tax deduction equal to the per-pupil expenditures in their public school district would cost the federal government an average of $7.75 billion per year over the 2006-10 period. This amount is less than 1% of federal income tax revenues. Because private school enrollment, public school expenditures, the likelihood of itemization, and marginal tax rates increase with taxpayer income, the dollar benefits of this change are positively related to income. At the margin, high-income taxpayers would receive about 35 cents in federal and state tax relief for each dollar of per-pupil expenditures forgone.","[Samwick, Andrew A.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Dartmouth College,,,"Samwick, Andrew/IXD-8235-2023","Samwick, Andrew/0000-0002-1402-8683",,,,,20,1,2,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60 ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA",1537-2650,,978-0-226-09779-4,TAX POL EC,,,2013,27.0,,,,,,125,160,,10.1086/671246,0.0,,,36,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJH56,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328232500006,0

In order to do so they should integrate the likelihood (i.e. probability) and the possible outcomes (good or bad). Nevertheless, research has shown that people do not always account for their decisions on the basis of a rational or a cold evaluation of utility. We suggest that when choosing between two risky alternatives people determine the relative perceived importance of the outcomes and probabilities before making their choice. If the outcome is more important, they will tend to choose the option with the best outcome. If the probability is more important, they will tend to choose the option with the higher probability for the desirable outcome, or the option with the lower probability for the undesirable outcome. This means that people maximize their utility based on their perceived importance of probabilities and outcomes. To test our argument, we conducted an experiment in which we asked the participants to decide between two uncertain outcomes. The results support our claim that the importance of the probability and the importance of the outcome affect the choice between two risky alternatives.","[Shavit, Tal] Coll Management Acad Studies, Sch Business Adm, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Rosenboim, Mosi] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Sch Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shani, Yaniv] Tel Aviv Univ, Recanati Grad Sch Business, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",College of Management Academic Studies; Ben Gurion University; Tel Aviv University,"Shavit, T (通讯作者)，Coll Management Acad Studies, Sch Business Adm, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",shavittal@gmail.com,"Shavit, Tal/GLU-8700-2022; Rosenboim, Mosi/F-1474-2012","Rosenboim, Mosi/0000-0001-9494-7606; Shani, Yaniv/0000-0001-8777-8162; Shavit, Tal/0000-0003-2966-302X",,,,,17,1,1,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Compared to macroscopic models, they include detailed lane changing restrictions and behaviors, which affect the throughput of the road infrastructure in certain situations. In order to achieve realistic macroscopic flow characteristics, several aspects of lane changing must be included in microscopic models, such as cooperation between drivers and per-vehicle lane-changing strategies and tactics. These aspects are important for achieving correct placement of vehicles on mandatory lanes in order to avoiding lane blocking situations and vehicle trapping in wrong queues. This paper presents an improved lane-changing model for metropolitan microscopic traffic simulations, which includes several methods for improving correct vehicle placement on mandatory lanes. These methods are integrated into a microscopic traffic simulation model which follows the cellular automata paradigm, in order to manage metropolitan-wide transportation scenarios. The influence of each method on the mandatory lane placement is evaluated through the experimental results presented in the final sections.","[Siromascenko, Alexandru] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,alex_siro@yahoo.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2013,,,,,,,613,618,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BGV43,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324282200112,0

In order to extent the current understanding, this paper anchors in the resource-based view with a dynamic capability approach. This innovative theoretical lens is appropriate for knowledge-intensive service firms since it recognizes their ability to integrate and reconfigure intellectual capital to address their rapidly changing environment. Accordingly, this paper considers the mediating role of radical and incremental innovation capabilities in the relationships between intellectual capital and performance. The moderating role of incremental and marketing capabilities is also considered under particular circumstances. This paper contributes to the current literature by identifying relevant dynamic capabilities of knowledge-intensive service firms but also by considering their moderating role, under particular circumstances.

Using the bound testing approach to cointegration and error correction modelling, we find some evidence to support the J-curve phenomenon, but the impact of real exchange rate on the trade account seems complex. While the services sector displays a J-curve effect, the goods sector response is quite the opposite: it has a positive response in the short run, but a weak negative response in the long run.","[Wijeweera, Albert] So Cross Univ, Sch Business, Tweed Heads, NSW, Australia; [Dollery, Brian] Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW, Australia",Southern Cross University; University of New England,"Wijeweera, A (通讯作者)，So Cross Univ, Sch Business, Tweed Heads, NSW, Australia.",albert.wijeweera@scu.edu.au,,"Dollery, Brian/0000-0003-2760-865X",,,,,7,5,6,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Of the five major claims we make in our book about the theory and practice of significance testing in economics, Mayer strongly agrees with four.

We assess three widely discussed proposals for leakage reduction: carbon-motivated border tax adjustments, industry exemptions from carbon regulation, and output-based allocation of emission allowances. We find that none of these measures amounts to a magic bullet when both efficiency and equity criteria matter. Compared to unilateral emission pricing alone, border carbon adjustments are most effective in leakage reduction and promotion of global cost-effectiveness but can markedly exacerbate regional inequality; exemptions and output-based allocation tend to avoid distributional pitfalls but are less effective in leakage reduction and global cost savings; exemptions may even decrease global cost-effectiveness of unilateral emission abatement.

We study it over 1985 to 2004 using a panel dataset of seventeen spanish regions. The results can be easily summarized. Firstly, it supports the classic public goods theory of a trade-off-between the economic benefits of size and the costs of heterogeneity. Secondly, it doesn't reject the Leviathan hypothesis and neither does the common pool hypothesis. Thirdly, by contrast, the paper partly rejects the Wallis' hypothesis. It argues that government size is mediated by financial resources obtained through intergovernmental grants, consistent with welfare economics and positive economic policies.

In contrast, every one of the rankings regarding individual outputs and industry output can go either way. More importantly, the duopoly may be less welfare-efficient than the monopoly. For example, when demands are linear, lower welfare is achieved if the asymmetry between firms is strong enough. One reason is that when firms are asymmetric, the output structure in the duopoly is distorted with probability one, whereas the output structure in the monopoly is generally socially optimal.","[Chang, Ming Chung; Lin, Chiu Fen] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chung Li City 320, Taiwan; [Lin, Yun-Chieh] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Management, I Lan City 260, Taiwan",National Central University; National Ilan University,"Chang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Chung Li City 320, Taiwan.",mcchang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,11,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,2436-097X,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

The analysis is based on a theory of bank lending in which the implicit opportunity costs of lending by a foreign bank affiliate are influenced by the scarcity of funds within the multinational conglomerate. The theory predicts that parent banks' influence should be stronger in loan segments with more pronounced information asymmetry. Our empirical model, which explains the interest rate charged by the affiliate by means of affiliate-level controls and a parent influence variable, is tested for three categories of commercial non-financial borrowers (domestically owned firms, foreign-owned firms and the self-employed). Evidence of parent influence is found in a limited number of cases of banks and borrower classes for which the constraint on fund flow within the parent bank group is likely to be tight, particularly when the borrower class is of strategic importance for the affiliate's overall performance.","[Derviz, Alexis; Rakova, Marie] Czech Natl Bank, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic; [Derviz, Alexis] Inst Informat Theory & Automat, CZ-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Derviz, A (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Prikope 28, CZ-11503 Prague 1, Czech Republic.",alexis.derviz@cnb.cz; marie.rakova@cnb.cz,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,14,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Might these crises be contagious internationally, or are fundamentals more likely to be responsible? This study creates monthly indices of money market pressure (MMP) for 20 emerging markets from 2002 to 2010, before using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methods to test for various spillovers among money and foreign exchange markets. We find that MMP Granger-causes exchange market pressure (EMP) in most countries, but that causality does not run the other direction. Secondly, MMP seems to be more contagious in Southeast Asia than in Latin America or among large emerging markets globally, and the most financially open economies are most susceptible to direct spillovers that do not operate through exchange markets. Finally, when examining domestic influences in large emerging markets, output drops are most likely to increase MMP. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Together with the within-household shadow price vector, the shadow budget determines the material well-being of the household member. In general, it is difficult to identify resource shares from typical household-level consumption data. However, several recent papers have shown that if resource shares do not depend on total household expenditure, then identification of resource shares may proceed from commonly available Engel curve data. Unfortunately, typical datasets do not allow the testing of this restriction. In this paper, we use a novel Italian dataset to establish that children's resource shares do not exhibit much dependence on total household expenditure. Thus, identification of resource shares on the basis of this restriction may be valid. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using high quality data, it is possible to directly observe individual net cash transfers in several countries and to investigate the effects of taxes and transfers on different social classes and in aggregate. This allows testing of both the redistribution hypothesis (more inequality leads to more redistribution in aggregate) and the median voter hypothesis (the middle class plays a special role in policy making). Results suggest acceptance of the former and reject on, or at least questioning, of the latter. Not only the gains from redistribution are negligible for the middle class, but also the link between income and redistribution is also lower for it than for any other class of income. Moreover, the strength of the median voter seems to fall over time. Finally, the amount of redistribution targeted to the middle class is lower in more asymmetric societies, a result that contrasts strongly with the median voter theorem.","Univ Milan, Dept Econ Business & Stat, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Scervini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",francesco.scervini@unimi.it,,"SCERVINI, Francesco/0000-0001-6403-5876",,,,,26,31,32,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

The previous literature shows that individuals can try to avoid risk classification by contracting a standard annuity earlier in their life. This paper offers a new perspective to the timing of the annuity purchase under the assumption that individuals already have an idea about their future risk type when young which becomes clearer over time. It shows that enhanced annuities can crowd out earlier standard annuities completely if the individuals have incomplete knowledge of their future risk type. However, if individuals are sufficiently risk averse and there is a sufficiently high proportion of low risks in the population, both products can remain in the market where lower risk types buy enhanced annuities while the higher risks stick to the early standard annuities. The paper identifies the equilibrium candidate with both annuity types to be Pareto-superior and the unique equilibrium.

We link banks' stock returns and CDS rates to sovereign CDS rates, to examine the spillover of sovereign risk to the banking system in the EU. More specifically, we use sovereign debt exposures from the EU's July 2010 stress tests to investigate whether heavily exposed banks were hit harder during the May 2010 crisis. The results are mixed. Banks exposed to distressed sovereign debt respond more strongly to changes in sovereign CDS rates. On closer examination, however, this result appears to be driven by banks which are located in countries experiencing sovereign debt problems. (C) 2012 Society for Policy Modeling.

Without transparency multiple equilibria can arise, and transparency eliminates the inferior equilibria. When full cooperation arises only under transparency, it occurs gradually: No worker sinks in the maximum amount of effort in the first round, preferring instead to smooth out contributions over time.

To do this we collect new data on the decentralization of investment, hiring, production, and sales decisions from corporate headquarters to local plant managers in almost 4,000 firms in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We find that firms headquartered in high-trust regions are significantly more likely to decentralize. To help identify causal effects, we look within multinational firms and show that higher levels of bilateral trust between the multinational's country of origin and subsidiary's country of location increases decentralization, even after instrumenting trust using religious similarities between the countries. Finally, we show evidence suggesting that trust raises aggregate productivity by facilitating reallocation between firms and allowing more efficient firms to grow, as CEOs can decentralize more decisions.","[Van Reenen, John] London Sch Econ, CEP, London WC2A 2AE, England; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Ctr Econ Performance, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Van Reenen, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CEP, London WC2A 2AE, England.",jvanreenen@lse.ac.uk,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019; Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019","Sadun, Raffaella/0000-0002-0987-8923","ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0846194] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,64,267,331,5,147,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of rising oil prices on the trade balance of Pakistan by using ARDL approach. Further, this study explores the causality direction between trade balance and oil price shocks in the context of Pakistan over a period of 1975-2010. The result shows that there is a significant negative relationship among oil prices, exchange rate and trade balance in Pakistan, i.e., if there is 1% increase in oil prices and exchange rate, the trade balance decreases by 0.382% and 0.342% respectively. This infers that oil prices and exchange rate induces trade imbalance in Pakistan. In addition, there is a positive relationship between output gap and trade balance which infers inefficient resource allocation and utilization in production. In the short run, there is a positive relationship among exchange rate, output gap and trade balance in Pakistan which shows that an increase in oil prices increases the net income flow in terms of huge cost payments for imports and increases the trade deficit in an economy. The result of Granger causality indicates that there is a bidirectional causality between oil prices and exchange rate in Pakistan which infers that Pakistan has to invest in alternative energy projects to reduce its dependence on oil imports, while there is a unidirectional causality running from oil prices to trade imbalance. This implies that the high oil prices are more appropriate than output gap because it covered all range cause of trade imbalance. The usage of oil in both forms as a fuel and energy can be substituted by solar energy, hydropower, coal energy, and wind energy and high oil demand can be reduced by the establishment of transport infrastructure. The intense need is to redefine and adopt practical step in energy conservation. Regulations, standards, and targets are important in order to provide direction of efficient level of utilization of oil as a fuel. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the programme boosted primary school completion rates of both boys and girls, but had a larger effect for boys, thereby increasing the gender gap in graduation. Additionally, the programme led to a widening of the achievement gap in government schools.

Based on our analysis, the following suggestions apply to the Chinese stock markets: establish and improve international and regional finance centers in Chinese mainland; encourage more qualified institutional investors; reposition the market relations among Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen; and increase deregulation and internationalization to speed up the integration of financial resources.","[Wang, Jian] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Junfeng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Dou, Feifei] E China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; East China University Political Science & Law,"Zhu, JF (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wangjian.fes@fudan.edu.cn; tiger0219926@hotmail.com; doufeifei@ecupl.edu.cn,"Liu, Shuyi/ISB-7338-2023",,,,,,28,9,9,2,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2012,20.0,6,,,,,102,120,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.12004.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,051RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000312146300005,0

Relying upon recent econometric methodologies (non-stationary long-memory models, wavelet models and time-varying factor representation models), we show that the transition paths to long-run growth (the catch-up dynamics) are very persistent over time and non-stationary, thereby yielding a variety of potential steady states (conditional convergence). Our findings do not support the idea according to which the developing countries share a common factor (such as technology) that eliminates per-capita output divergence in the very long run. Instead, we conclude that growth is an idiosyncratic phenomenon that yields different forms of transitional economic performance: growth tragedy (some countries with an initial low level of per-capita income diverge from the richest ones), growth resistance (with many countries experiencing a low speed of growth convergence), and rapid convergence.","[Dufrenot, Gilles] Univ Aix Marseille 2, DEFI, Banque France, Paris, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles; Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France; [Mignon, Valerie; Naccache, Theo] Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Mignon, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, EconomiX CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",valerie.mignon@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,78,8,10,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We derive analytically, the restrictions on the parameter space that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of balanced growth paths and saddle-path stable local dynamics. We demonstrate that in contrast to the original model, with the addition of an external effect and depreciation in the human capital sector, the Lucas model can be made consistent with the high degrees of intertemporal elasticities of substitution increasingly estimated in the empirical literature-even if there is a significant degree of increasing returns to scale in the physical production sector of the economy. Finally we demonstrate that for a given baseline rate of steady state growth, with the inclusion of modest degrees of depreciation and external effects to the human capital production process, the model can accommodate the widest possible range of economies-including those characterized by low discount factors, high elasticities of intertemporal substitution, increasing returns in the final goods sector, and also both the high rates of population growth and steady state per-capita output growth we observe in many parts of the world today.

Sequential procedures are also used to obtain graphical tools that are consistent with the spirit of Ravallion and Chen's growth incidence curve and Son's poverty growth curve. Contrary to traditional unidimensional tests, our method makes it possible to take into account the importance of deprivation correlations at the individual level and thus may reverse results observed with the traditional tools used to check the pro-poorness of growth.

Social polarization breeds discriminatory practices regarding government redistribution. This brings about inefficient allocation of resources away from production to political power struggle, leading to poor economic outcomes. However, the model shows that social integrative processes may correct this inefficiency over time depending on the degree of social fractionalization, the level of social distance between the groups, the level of production technology, etc. Even though the model predicts long-run convergence of growth rates and output per capita across countries, it shows possible prolonged divergence of these economic variables.

However, coordination is needed at a global level for global environmental problems characterised by scientific controversies, uncertainty, irreversibility, long-term impacts, economic and geopolitical dimensions. The Convention on Biological Diversity is a good illustration in this regard. The rules it promotes are clearly inspired by mainstream economics. It has therefore been celebrated as a textbook example of sound environmental policy. However, its success has been limited so far and its position within the international conservation regime is challenged. We argue that an alternative analytical approach to environmental global policies is needed and that the French theories of conventions and rgulation open up promising prospects in this respect.","[Boisvert, Valerie] UPV Montpellier 3, IRD, IRD UMR GRED, F-45072 Orleans 2, France; [Vivien, Franck-Dominique] Univ Reims, F-51100 Reims, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Boisvert, V (通讯作者)，UPV Montpellier 3, IRD, IRD UMR GRED, Technoparc,5 Rue Carbone, F-45072 Orleans 2, France.",valerie.boisvert@ird.fr,,"Boisvert, Valerie/0000-0003-3449-7150",,,,,56,9,9,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We hypothesize that subjects who are aware of the chaining strategically behave and provide invalid subjective probabilities, while subjects who are not aware of the chaining state their real beliefs and provide valid subjective probabilities. The validity of subjective probabilities is investigated using de Finetti's notion of coherence, under which probability estimates are valid if and only if they obey all axioms of probability theory. Four experimental treatments are designed and implemented. Subjects are divided into two initial treatment groups: in the first, they are provided with real monetary incentives, and in the second, they are not. Each group is further sub-divided into two treatment groups, in the first, the chained structure of the experimental design is made clear to the subjects, while, in the second, the chained structure is hidden by randomizing the elicitation questions. Our results suggest that subjects provided with monetary incentives and randomized questions provide valid subjective probabilities because they are not aware of the chaining which undermines the incentive compatibility of the exchangeability method.

In particular, panel unit root and panel cointegration techniques are utilized to examine the dynamic model. The empirical results of the SBLM show that the banking industry is highly competitive. The empirical results of DBLEC also suggest that the commercial banking industry is close to being perfectly competitive in the short run. By contrast, the adjustment speeds of the supply and demand sides towards the long-run equilibrium are quite slow in that market, which implies that the U.S. commercial banks enjoy a certain degree of long-run market power.

Although under the specification of Campbell and Cochrane, [Journal of Political Economy 107, 205-251 (1999)] the equity risk premium is countercyclical because increases in risk aversion are reinforced by rising recession risks, this need not be the case more generally. We show analytically that in endowment economies procyclical recession expectations can outweigh countercyclical changes in risk aversion, generating counterfactual risk-premium behavior. However, allowing shocks or habits to be sufficiently persistent, or explicitly accounting for the impact of habits on consumption, suffices to generate countercyclical recession risks and risk premia.","[De Paoli, Bianca] Bank England, Monetary Anal HO 2, London EC2R 8AH, England; [De Paoli, Bianca] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; [Zabczyk, Pawel] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Bank of England; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Central Bank,"De Paoli, B (通讯作者)，Bank England, Monetary Anal HO 2, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",bianca.depaoli@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,31,9,9,0,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

It, firstly, applies a combined jump GARCH model in order to characterize the behavior of daily, weekly as well as monthly oil prices. Secondly, it relates its empirical results to implications of Hotelling-type resource extraction models. The empirical analysis shows that oil prices are characterized by GARCH as well as conditional jump behavior and that a considerable portion of the total variance is triggered by sudden extreme price movements. This finding implies that, first, oil price signals are not reliable and, as a consequence, both finding optimal extraction paths and decisions regarding the transmission to alternative technologies are likely to be compromised. Second, this behavior is in stark contrast to the notion of deterministic trends in the price of oil. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A notable feature of the model is that it employs a non-separable utility function between consumption and the level of public health infrastructure (publicly provided health environment). In addition to the effects on utility, an increase in the public health level contributes to labor productivity growth. From a three-dimensional dynamic system that includes physical capital, public health infrastructure and consumption, our model is found to have multiple equilibria (dual steady states) if the deep parameters of the utility function satisfy certain conditions. Then, numerical computations demonstrate that each equilibrium exhibits local saddle-path stability. This result deserves careful attention, as it indicates that the economy experiences a relatively undiversified growth pattern when converging on high- and low-growth equilibria. Our striking result has important implications in the study of growth and development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Focusing on China's listed companies for a sample period from the first quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2011, we find that quantity-oriented and price-based monetary policies have heterogeneous impacts on corporate investment behavior, but the influence of monetary policies is constrained by the liquidity, inventory, size and assetliability ratio of a firm. Firms with higher liquidity, lower inventory level and lower assetliability ratios are less sensitive to the impact from two kinds of monetary policies. The larger the size of the firm, the less it is subject to influence from quantity-oriented monetary policy; it responds more to price-based monetary policy. The policy implication is that the monetary authorities should pay attention to the importance of policy-making based on the monetary demand of microeconomic entities.","[Huang, Ying Sophie; Wang, Yizhong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Song, Frank M.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; University of Hong Kong,"Wang, YZ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",sophiehuangying@yahoo.com; fmsong@econ.hku.hk; wangyizhong@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,31,18,19,1,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2012,20.0,5,,,,,1,20,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01299.x,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,014SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309395400001,0

The traditional providers of default risk assessments are the credit rating agencies, which have of late suffered damaged reputations. The author, a former Senior Director at Moody's Analytics, argues that rating agency assessments of government bonds suffer from a failure to use modern social science research methods. He contends that economists and other academics are better suited to the task of estimating the likelihood of government bond defaults. Economists can provide an alternative source of analysis by collecting and analyzing time series of fiscal data and building simulations of future revenues and expenditures. To encourage more academics to enter this field, the author is contributing historical data and an open-source simulation platform.","Publ Sect Credit Solut, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA",,"Joffe, MD (通讯作者)，Publ Sect Credit Solut, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",marc@publicsectorcredit.org,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,20,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

J,"Meng, X",,,,"Meng, Xin",,,Labor Market Outcomes and Reforms in China,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,URBAN CHINA; EDUCATION; INEQUALITY; POLICY; INCOME,"Over the past few decades of economic reform, China's labor markets have been transformed to an increasingly market-driven system. China has two segregated economies: the rural and urban. Understanding the shifting nature of this divide is probably the key to understanding the most important labor market reform issues of the last decades and the decades ahead. From 1949, the Chinese economy allowed virtually no labor mobility between the rural and urban sectors. Rural-urban segregation was enforced by a household registration system called hukou. Individuals born in rural areas receive agriculture hukou while those born in cities are designated as nonagricultural hukou. In the countryside, employment and income were linked to the commune-based production system. Collectively owned communes provided very basic coverage for health, education, and pensions. In cities, state-assigned life-time employment, centrally determined wages, and a cradle-to-grave social welfare system were implemented. In the late 1970s, China's economic reforms began, but the timing and pattern of the changes were quite different across rural and urban labor markets. This paper focuses on employment and wages in the urban labor markets, the interaction between the urban and rural labor markets through migration, and future labor market challenges. Despite the remarkable changes that have occurred, inherited institutional impediments still play an important role in the allocation of labor; the hukou system remains in place, and 72 percent of China's population is still identified as rural hukou holders. China must continue to ease its restrictions on rurala is an element of urban migration, and must adopt policies to close the widening rural-urban gap in education, or it risks suffering both a shortage of workers in the growing urban areas and a deepening urban-rural economic divide.","Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Meng, X (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",xin.meng@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,73,244,284,9,107,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In practice, the estimation of liquidity extreme risk by VaR generally uses models assuming independence of bid-ask spreads. However, bid-ask spreads tend to occur in clusters with time dependency, particularly during crisis period. Our paper attempts to fill this gap by studying the impact of negligence of dependency in liquidity extreme risk assessment of Tunisian stock market. The main methods which take into account returns dependency to assess market risk is Time series-Extreme Value Theory combination. Therefore we compare VaRs estimated under independency (Variance-Covariance Approach. Historical Simulation and the VaR adjusted to extreme values) relatively to the VaR when dependence is considered. The efficiency of those methods was tested and compared using the backtesting tests. The results confirm the adequacy of the recent extensions of liquidity risk in the VaR estimation. Therefore, we prove a performance improvement of VaR estimates under the assumption of dependency across a significant reduction of the estimation error, particularly with AR (1)-GARCH (1.1)-GPD model.

The here presented 'within-culture across-country' design of a standard trust experiment reveals an interesting phenomenon which most probably is related to the context that people live in: South African communities expressed extremely low trust while participants from Namibia exhibited high trust, but low reciprocity, although both share the same ethnic background. The country effect between the two regions remained large even after using a matching estimator to substantiate that these differences were not driven by sample selection bias. Qualitative evidence from the study area suggests that corrupt local institutions have led to lower trust in South African communities while participants in Namibia seemingly applied a deep-rooted behavioural norm of the Nama society which they perceived to be appropriate for the exchange in the experiment.","[Vollan, Bjoern] Leibniz Ctr Marine Trop Ecol ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Vollan, Bjoern] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Marine Tropenforschung (ZMT); University of Mannheim,"Vollan, B (通讯作者)，Leibniz Ctr Marine Trop Ecol ZMT, Fahrenheitstr 6, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",bjoern.vollan@zmt-bremen.de,"Vollan, Björn/AAN-9265-2020","Vollan, Björn/0000-0002-5592-4185",,,,,55,6,6,0,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Using panel data techniques, the authors estimate several specifications to provide support of such relationship for MENA countries over the period 1980-2009. The findings provide new robust evidence on how remittances are used in MENA countries and detect the main channels which may interfere in this process. Estimation outcomes show that the most important part of remittances is consumed and that remittances stimulate growth only when they are invested. Moreover, empirical results suggest that remittances can enhance growth by encouraging human capital accumulation. Human capital is therefore an effective channel through which remittances stimulate growth in MENA countries.","[Ben Ali, Mohamed Sami] Univ Sousse, Dept Econ, IHEC Business Sch Sousse, Sahloul, Sousse, Tunisia",Universite de Sousse,"Ben Ali, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Sousse, Dept Econ, IHEC Business Sch Sousse, Sahloul, Sousse, Tunisia.",mohamedsami.benali@ihecso.rnu.tn,"Ali, Mohamed Sami Ben/AAE-3983-2019","Ali, Mohamed Sami Ben/0000-0002-2993-1971",,,,,46,4,5,0,15,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,AUG 27,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201233.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-33,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,002KE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000308530100001,0

We model tough love by modifying the Barro-Becker standard altruism model in two ways. First, the childs discount factor is endogenously determined, so lower childhood consumption leads to a higher discount factor later in life. Second, the parent evaluates the childs lifetime utility with a constant high discount factor. Our model predicts that parental transfers will fall when the childs discount factor falls. This is in contrast with the standard altruism model, which predicts that parental transfers are independent of exogenous changes in the childs discount factor.","[Ogaki, Masao] Keio Univ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; James Madison Univ, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",Keio University; James Madison University,"Ogaki, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Minato Ku, 612 Mita Kenkyu Shitsu,2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",mogaki@econ.keio.ac.jp,,"Bhatt, Vipul/0000-0002-2285-6358",,,,,56,13,13,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

J,"Caputo, M",,,,"Caputo, Michele",,,The Memory Response of Populations and Markets to Extreme Events,ECONOMIA POLITICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DIFFUSION,"The Memory Response of Populations and Markets to Extreme Events (J.E.L. C6, J1) This study aims to discuss and quantify the reaction of a market or a population to perturbations assuming that their behaviour is governed by a differential equation containing a memory formalism modelling their evolution. A perturbation acts on a market, as well as on a population, as the delta function to generate the Green function. In both cases the memory has a stabilising effect. In the case of markets it is seen how the memory formalisms will definitely stabilise the market when the intensity of the perturbation is small relative to the effect of the memory; when the intensity of the perturbation is larger the market may lead to an extreme event. The same would be true also for populations. As practical cases we consider the people of Polesine (Italy) returning to their homes after leaving as a consequence of the 1951 Po River flood, then we consider the variation of the number of Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM) in the US after the 2001 September 11th terrorist attack in New York and finally the number of abortions in Italy following the 1978 law legalising the abortions. It is seen that in the three cases, in spite of the differences, the return to normality had similar features: the number of individuals affected by the extreme event had an initial sudden variation followed by oscillations of decreasing amplitude. A table with the values of the parameters tentatively obtained from the population data is finally presented.","[Caputo, Michele] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Fis, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Caputo, Michele] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX USA",Sapienza University Rome; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Caputo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Fis, Piazzale A Moro 2, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",mic.caputo@tiscali.it,,,,,,,30,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

They lead to a strong empirical regularity, i.e. that output gaps and output growth are non-normally distributed. Mainstream macroeconomic models explain this phenomenon by invoking exogenous shocks that are non-normally distributed. This is not a very satisfactory explanation as it shifts our ignorance one step further. I propose an explanation based on a behavioral macroeconomic model, in which agents are assumed to have limited cognitive abilities and thus develop different beliefs. This model produces waves of optimism and pessimism in an endogenous way (animal spirits) and provides for a better (endogenous) explanation of the observed non-normality in output movements. I also analyze the implications for monetary policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By novation, a third party steps into a bilateral contract, guaranteeing performance of both legs of the trade. Central counterparties (CCPs) are entities whose special purpose is novating trades, relieving market participants from counterparty risk. However, in most cases, the CCP is not the sole novator: the CCP novates contracts between its clearing members, which in turn novate trades for other (typically smaller) participants and so on. This paper develops an abstract model of such hierarchical clearing networks. Novation is modelled here as a function which transforms (trading) exposures into (cleared) exposures. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we study how such function is affected by the clearing network's topology, drawing conclusions on the risks faced by the CCP, and on the system's margin requirements.
