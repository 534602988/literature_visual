The article then considers modifications of policy rules to deal with changes in interest rate spreads, credit aggregates and banks' balance sheets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on China's provincial-level panel data in 19492010, this paper empirically investigates whether the geographic distribution of health care resources is convergent or divergent in the long run and whether the rapid economic growth contributes to reducing the regional disparity in health care resources in China. Using a dynamic convergence model that controls unobserved provincial heterogeneity and spatial dependence, the empirical results provide much support for beta-convergence in that the provinces with lower initial values of health care resources, including the densities of physicians and hospital beds, are seen to grow faster and to catch up with the provinces with higher initial stocks. In addition, we find that GDP per capita has a significant and non-linear impact on the convergence rate of health care resources, providing support for a Kuznets curve in China's health sector. That is, the inequality in the distribution of health care resources follows an inverted U shape as income increases overtime. An important implication of our study is that economic growth per se provides a built-in stabilizer to mitigate health inequality through the convergence of health care resources across regions in the long run.

Therefore, the hypothesis that citizens adapt to the growth of GDP is tested. This paper analyses empirically the relationship between a deviation in the trend of seasonally adjusted GDP growth and life satisfaction in Euro zone member countries based on data from the European Commission's Eurobarometer report. This approach is new to the literature and it enables us to detect medium-term adaptation effects on growth rates. This adds a new way of tackling the question of why economic prosperity has had little or no influence on life satisfaction levels. We found that country-wide differences in the relationship of trend GDP growth and life satisfaction exist. Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain showed a significantly positive relationship. For other euro member countries, the hypothesis does not hold. This suggests that two different groups exist and if everything else is held constant, economic growth strategies should vary.","Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept World Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Wiese, T (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept World Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",thomas.wiese@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,36,1,1,3,23,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We assume that the source of TFP growth can be either domestic or foreign innovation or technology transfer from the technological frontier. Trade openness, R&D, and human capital can have two effects: a direct effect on TFP (e.g., through innovation) and an indirect effect depending on the productivity gap between a given country and the technological frontier. We find that tougher domestic competition is always associated with higher sectoral productivity. Both import and export penetrations are positively associated with an increase of TFP. However, the channels through which higher TFP is materialized are different: export penetration works through level effect, while import penetration acts mainly when conditional on the level of technological development. The economical magnitude of the effect is not trivial.","[Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Ul Narutowicza, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Wolszczak-Derlacz, J (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Ul Narutowicza, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",jwo@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/O-4433-2018","Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/0000-0002-3392-5267",,,,,36,0,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We document widespread tire pressure neglect - three-quarters of drivers waste gas driving on underinflated tires. Negative descriptive social norms are one potential cause, but have not been tested in high-neglect environments, where those norms are widespread. This confounds the mechanism: are these norms signals of private value to consumers, or do they imply standards for social judgment from others? We conducted a field experiment at gas stations in Chicago - our intervention included treatments with information about tire pressure neglect, promotions in the form of price reductions from $0.50 to free, a descriptive norm of behavior, and help in the form of air pump assistance. The treatments are designed to provide the ability to consider four potential underlying drivers: information, monetary cost, social norms and social pressure. Treatments that only included information were ineffective, despite average fuel savings of $10.51, but small promotions had substantial impacts. When the air pump price was free, the social norm discouraged inflation. However, when the research assistant offered help, inflation rates were buoyed by the social norm. These results highlight the importance of incentives over mere information treatments, and offer a new perspective on how information and monetary levers can influence decision-making in the presence of negative social norms.

The article concentrates on production processes as principal loci of structural economic dynamics along increasing and decreasing returns trajectories. These trajectories are triggered by structural opportunities and constraints embedded in production systems, and their historical realisation is subject to different institutional configurations-production units at different levels of aggregation. The approach envisioned suggests the possibility of governing economic dynamics by structural policies working on the technological and organisational conditions of production as well as on the configuration of production processes within production units.

Along the intensive margin, further research that uses household and firm-level panel data of energy consumption may help identify how energy consumers around the world respond to weather shocks.

In contrast, global efficiency judgements exert no significant positive effect on policy proposal acceptance. These effects even hold for economists who self-reported a global perspective in the assessment of the policy proposals.

This paper quantitatively evaluates the performance of energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction in this period, the impact of these policies and potentials, by integrating the contributions of energy conversion efficiency and energy utilization efficiency improvement industrial restructuring, fuel mix shift and renewable energy development in a unified framework, as a first attempt to introduce energy conversion efficiency improvement into a decomposition approach. Comprehensive and specific policies are summarized as a policy list to be investigated. The results show that energy intensity and conversion efficiency effects were mainly responsible for driving down energy consumption, by 637.4 Mtce and 85.4 Mtce respectively, and they reduced CO2 emissions by 1345.3 Mt and 243.8 Mt respectively due to a significant improvement in the 11th FYP period. Most of the contributions made by the conversion efficiency effect (94%) come from thermal power generation, and the emission coefficient effect reduced CO2 emissions by 17.4 Mt through developing renewable energy. Economic growth is still the biggest driver of energy consumption and increasing emissions, while industrial restructuring and fuel mix shift effects contributed relatively little. Developing renewable energy and promoting economic restructuring to limit the increase of energy-intensive sectors are still the main challenges and the next policy focus to achieve the targets for energy saving and carbon emission reduction in the 12th Five-Year Plan.

To exclude the influence of trade balance, this paper proposes a methodology to parcel the pollution haven hypothesis into a multi-regional input-output model, applies it to a longer time gap, which is made up of two representative periods of Chinese economy (1997-2002 and 2002-2007), and clarifies the provincial and sectoral contributions to national emissions. We find that (1) embodied CO2 emissions first remain relatively stable and then increase sharply for the two periods, and the changing trends are mainly determined by the decreasing carbon intensity and the expanding trade scale, respectively. (2) With the secondary industry as the main contributor, regional carbon spillover is mainly concentrated in the coastal provinces but it contributes to an increase of CO2 emissions in the central and western regions.

Since the authors simultaneously estimate the effects of income inequality and its reduction, their results might indicate that not only the outcome (inequality), but also the procedure (redistribution) that leads to the outcome influences subjective wellbeing. Their results also show that the positive effect of redistribution is stronger for less affluent members of the society and left-wing oriented individuals.

Studies based on structural vector autoregressions typically achieve identification by restricting the contemporaneous interaction of fiscal and non-fiscal variables in a rather arbitrary way. In this paper, we relax those restrictions and identify fiscal policy shocks by exploiting the conditional heteroscedasticity of the structural disturbances. We use this methodology to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy shocks in the U.S. before and after 1979. Our results show substantive differences in the economy's response to government spending and tax shocks across the two periods. Importantly, we find that increases in public spending are, in general, more effective than tax cuts in stimulating economic activity. A key contribution of this study is to provide a formal test of the identifying restrictions commonly used in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Campbell, A",,,,"Campbell, Arthur",,,Signaling in social network and social capital formation,ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social networks; Signaling; Network formation; Trust; Repeated games,RISK; INSURANCE; FRIENDS,"This paper presents a model of social capital and social network formation. The key interaction within the model is that whom an individual chooses to become friends with affects the value (social capital) of the friendship. In the model, how a player searches for and then forms friendships reveals how willing she is to engage in cooperation with a potential friend. Individuals observe their local network structure (friends and cliques) and the actions of players within these. Willingness to cooperate is private information and is captured by the discount factor of an individual. Cooperative types have high discount factors and can signal their type by forming a clique through befriending a friend of a friend. Uncooperative types do not form these kinds of friendships because of the local observability of their actions to all members of a clique. Thus, when a player meets someone with whom she shares a friend, her belief that the individual has a high discount factor is greater than the population average. In this sense, people trust each other more when they share a friend in common. Finally, I relate the primitives of the model to characteristics of the implied social network by nesting the sequential equilibrium in an algorithm of network formation proposed by Jackson and Rogers (Am Econ Rev 97(3):890-915, 2007). The model highlights a trade-off between maximizing the total amount of social capital in a society and distributing it equitably across individuals.","Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Campbell, A (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Management, Box 208200, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",arthur.campbell@yale.edu,,"Campbell, Arthur/0000-0002-5444-2125",,,,,34,5,8,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It has been suggested that closer owner supervision and the injection of a new management team revitalize the acquired organization and unlock dormant capabilities and value. However, both politicians and trade unionists suggest that private equity acquirers may significantly reallocate value away from employees to short term investors, typically through layoffs and reduced wages, which may undermine future organizational sustainability. This article investigates this in the context of a sample of institutional buy outs (IBOs) undertaken in the UK between 1997 and 2006. Specifically we examine the impact of IBOs on both employment and remuneration against two control groups of non-acquired firms. In designing our study we follow the empirical approach taken by Conyon et al. (2001, 2002) in investigating the employment consequences of regular takeovers.

The uselessness of money as an intermediate target is driven, at least in part, by empirical research that suggests that money demand is unstable. In addition, the informational quality of money has been called into question by empirical research that fails to identify a relationship between money growth and inflation, nominal income growth, and the output gap. Nevertheless, this research is potentially flawed by the use of simple sum money aggregates, which are not consistent with economic, aggregation, or index number theory. This paper therefore reexamines previous empirical evidence on money demand and the role of money as an information variable, using Divisia monetary aggregates. These aggregates have the advantage of being derived from microtheoretic foundations, as well as being consistent with aggregation and index number theory. The results of the reevaluation suggest that previous empirical work might be driven by mismeasurement.","[Hendrickson, Joshua R.] Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Hendrickson, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrhendr1@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,29,41,45,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

But it is not clear that these students exert more effort. We build a model of students, schools, and employers to study the interaction of family background and effort exerted by the student in the education process. Two factors turn out to be key in determining the relationship between effort and family background: (i) the student's attitude toward risk and (ii) how the student's marginal productivity of effort depends on her family background. We show that when the degree of risk aversion is relatively low (high) compared to the sensitivity of the marginal productivity of effort, students from more advantageous family backgrounds exert more (less) effort. Empirically, we find that if parental education was reduced from holding a university degree to incomplete compulsory education, primary and secondary school students would exert around 21-23% less effort (approximately equal to a reduction of 2 hours weekly in homework). For primary school students we also find that marginal productivities of effort are higher for those from less advantageous family backgrounds.","[Kuehn, Zoe] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Landeras, Pedro] Fdn Estudios Econ Aplicada FEDEA, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Kuehn, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, C Francisco Tomas y Valiente 5,Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",zoe.kuehn@uam.es; planderas@fedea.es,"Kuehn, Zoe/AAL-7694-2021",,,,,,58,1,1,1,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We show that free entry results in too much competition for the world, but each country's corrective tax policy, unless internationally coordinated, proves suboptimal because of international policy spillovers. Thus, globalization prevents countries from pursuing the optimal entry policy. However, globalization also generates the gains from trade. When countries are small, the gains from trade dominate the losses from a suboptimal entry policy, but as markets grow the result is reversed, making trade inferior to autarky. Therefore, the need for tax harmonization grows as the world economy grows. This paper also contributes to the international tax competition literature through the discovery of the reverse home market effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The data are consistent with this finding being driven by concessions from low-cost sellers in response to differentiation reducing their likelihood of being the buyer's surplus-maximizing trading partner.

Lower monetary policy rates can worsen or reduce these incentives depending on the size of the shock when equity financing is ruled out. When this constrained is relaxed but the bank faces costly dividend adjustment, lower monetary policy rates always worsen risk-taking incentives and the effect is persistent. The reason is that costly dividend adjustment lowers the opportunity cost of lending. In this model, capital requirements are closer to the source of the distortion and thus work better than loan-to-value caps in reducing excessive risk taking. (C) 2014 International Monetary Fund.

The effects of increases in excise, value added and personal income taxes are simulated separately and jointly. The results indicate that the extra revenues obtained from each tax figure are lower than the ex-ante calculations estimated by the Government. Moreover, the reductions in the public deficit accomplished are considerably smaller due to general equilibrium effects such as lower production levels, greater unemployment rates and higher prices and transfers paid by the Government.

We estimate a mixed logit model, in which households choose between different broadband technologies: DSL, cable modem, fibre, WiFi and mobile. We find that a number of household characteristics influence the technology choices, and there is also significant unobserved heterogeneity. Demand for Internet access is highly price sensitive. The price elasticity of demand for DSL is -3.02, which falls in the middle of the range of elasticities for the other technologies. Furthermore, the price elasticity of demand at the level of all fixed broadband technologies (DSL + cable modem + fibre + WiFi) is equal to -1.98. For a reasonable range of profit margins, this estimate implies that mobile broadband should be included in the relevant antitrust market of fixed broadband. Our findings have implications for competition policy in Central and Eastern European countries where due to poor copper networks mobile broadband is an important alternative to fixed broadband.

To do this, we develop long-and short-run models (a bounds testing approach to cointegration) for twelve emerging economies over the period 1980-2010. Estimates from all models show that exchange rate volatility has a significant effect on stock market development in both the short run and long run in a majority of countries.

While there has been a wave of public and scholarly interest, official data on food safety are scarce, and some fundamental questions remain unanswered. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of media-based event data as a source for scholars and policy makers interested in understanding more about China's food safety crisis. While some biases are likely present, we find that the data produce a reasonable set of results: food safety problems are most acute in poor provinces, and where government expenditures are low. Reported food safety incidents also increase with the rate of urbanization, which may reflect the increased complexity of urban food systems or an urban bias in Chinese media. Importantly, our results indicate that media data can be a valid source for scholars interested in studying food safety or other controversial topics in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We confront subjects with situations in which the theory suggests that there is an incentive or no incentive to misreport. We find little misreporting in situations where misreporting is a Nash equilibrium. However, we also find a significant degree of misreporting in situations where there is actually no benefit to doing so.

At the same time, across successive cohorts born after 1950, there is a stagnation in the fraction of high school graduates that go on to complete a college degree. What explains this phenomenon? I formulate a life-cycle model of human capital accumulation in college and on the job, where successive cohorts decide whether or not to acquire a college degree as well as the quality of their college education. Cohorts differ by the sequence of rental price per unit of human capital they face and by the distribution of initial human capital across individuals. My model reproduces the observed pattern in college attainment for the 1920-1970 birth cohorts. The stagnation in college attainment is due to the decrease in the growth rate of the rental price per unit of human capital commencing in the 1970s. My model also generates about 80% of the increase in lifetime earnings for college graduates relative to those for high school graduates observed across cohorts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The two innovation regimes differ in the nature of their knowledge base: reliance on generally available knowledge or dependence on a firm's historically accumulated knowledge base. Innovation in the latter regime benefits from longer job durations.

(2009). The model used in this study considers that the Central Bank minimizes a loss function, taking into account the deviation of inflation from its target, output stabilization, the interest rate smoothing and, unlike the previous works, the exchange rate. The results show that the major concern of the monetary authority in the period was the stabilization of inflation, followed by interest rate smoothing, exchange stabilization and, finally, output stabilization. The large value for the exchange rate smoothing parameter suggests the presence of fear of floating in the Brazilian case. An improved inflation targeting strategy should allow for less Central Bank intervention in the exchange rate market. (C) 2014 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Wolpin's (2013) monograph The Limits of Inference without Theory, which arose from lectures he presented at the Cowles Foundation in 2010 in honor of Tjalling Koopmans. While I readily agree with Wolpin's basic premise that empirical work that eschews the role of economic theory faces unnecessary self-imposed limits relative to empirical work that embraces and tries to test and improve economic theory, it is important to be aware that the use of economic theory is not a panacea. I point out that there are also serious limits to inference with theory: 1) there may be no truly structural (policy invariant) parameters, a key assumption underpinning the structural econometric approach that Wolpin and the Cowles Foundation have championed; 2) there is a curse of dimensionality that makes it very difficult for us to elucidate the detailed implications of economic theories, which is necessary to empirically implement and test these theories; 3) there is an identification problem that makes it impossible to decide between competing theories without imposing ad hoc auxiliary assumptions (such as parametric functional form assumptions); and 4) there is a problem of multiplicity and indeterminacy of equilibria that limits the predictive empirical content of many economic theories. I conclude that though these are very challenging problems, I agree with Wolpin and the Cowles Foundation that economists have far more to gain by trying to incorporate economic theory into empirical work and test and improve our theories than by rejecting theory and presuming that all interesting economic issues can be answered by well-designed controlled, randomized experiments and assuming that difficult questions of causality and evaluation of alternative hypothetical policies can be resolved by simply allowing the data to speak for itself.","Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Rust, J (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,95,12,12,0,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Hence, in most recent global MRIO tables these countries are either roughly estimated or summarised in one rest of the world (RoW) region. Combining a wide range of countries, this RoW region may play a significant role in global economic and environmental accounts. We conceptualise the importance of RoW in several environmental footprint accounts and present algorithms to estimate the structure of RoW. The approach utilises the information of the economic structure within known parts of the MRIO table to estimate the unknown structure. Using this method, global warming potential and employment footprints remain stable irrespective of the chosen initial estimates, whereas natural land use footprints and individual product impacts vary significantly.","[Stadler, Konstantin; Steen-Olsen, Kjartan; Wood, Richard] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Stadler, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway.",konstantin.stadler@ntnu.no,"Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015; Stadler, Konstantin/H-7541-2019","Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Stadler, Konstantin/0000-0002-1548-201X",,,,,29,38,40,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

While China is currently building up its strategic oil reserves to ensure energy security, it is of great importance to investigate China's optimal oil stockpiling policies while taking into account the possibility of imposing an import tariff or quota, which can also be used for alleviating the energy insecurity of an oil-importing country. Employing a dynamic programming framework, this paper examines the optimal SPR policies and oil import tariffs or quotas for China and the interactions between the two instruments under different scenarios for the world oil market. The results show that the combination of optimal tariffs and SPR policies can substantially reduce the expected oil insecurity cost for China; the effect is larger when the probability that a disruption will continue is higher.

The modelling approach considers the institutional factors of water rights and permits the inclusive determination of water and land allocations. We utilize farm-level data of irrigated agriculture in Water District #1 in Idaho to examine the predictions from our theoretical model. The water rights priority date is consolidated at the farm level and used to differentiate farmers' responses. We test a set of hypotheses that relate to water supply and crop revenue. Our results suggest that the water rights priority has a profound impact on agricultural outcomes, indicating strong institutional effects and weak influence of market-based approaches. Farmers respond to both long-term and seasonal water supply change and variation, and they respond to seasonal water supply forecasts in varied ways depending on their water rights portfolios, thus signalling a disproportionate distribution of potential impacts of water supply change.","[Xu, W.; Lowe, S.

This view, often referred to as electoral democracy, is particularly pronounced in the empirical literature. We reincorporate the role of civil liberties, which are at the core of modern democracy, in two ways. We identify four fundamental sources of potential differences in the evolution of political rights and civil liberties. We present systematic, robust and varied empirical evidence on the direct impact of two of these potential sources of differences using cross-national panel data and accounting for the modernization hypothesis. We obtain two noteworthy empirical results: civil liberties exhibit greater persistence than political rights in affecting subsequent outcomes; and, our main result, civil liberties are complementary to political rights when affecting subsequent outcomes, while the reverse is not the case. Consequently, one must incorporate civil liberties as a determinant of electoral democracy. More generally, both dimensions must be considered to understand the setbacks recently experienced by many democracies, despite their holding of free and fair elections.

Although boys and girls display similar levels of academic ability, boys choose substantially more prestigious academic tracks, where more prestigious tracks are more math- and science-intensive. Our experimental measure shows that boys are also substantially more competitive than girls. We find that competitiveness is strongly positively correlated with choosing more prestigious academic tracks even conditional on academic ability. Most important, we find that the gender difference in competitiveness accounts for a substantial portion (about 20%) of the gender difference in track choice.","[Buser, Thomas] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Amsterdam; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Buser, T (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Oosterbeek, Hessel/JXX-9860-2024","Oosterbeek, Hessel/0000-0001-7078-9957",,,,,48,359,404,21,230,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Using the World Values Survey, we find that individuals with higher levels of schooling, but whose income outcomes fall short of that predicted by their biographical characteristics, in turn display a greater propensity to engage in protest activities. We discuss a number of interpretations that are consistent with this finding, including the idea that economic conditions can affect how individuals trade off the use of their human capital between production and political activities. Our results could also reflect a link between education, grievance, and political protest, although we argue that this is unlikely to be the sole explanation. Separately, we show that the interaction between schooling and economic conditions matters too at the country level: Rising education levels coupled with macroeconomic weakness are associated with increased incumbent turnover, as well as subsequent pressures toward democratization.

Recent economic models suggest that where a proscribed activity is prevalent, permissive laws liberalize attitudes toward partakers while increasing utility. The opposite occurs in communities where the proscribed activity is rare. To test these predictions, we randomize data entry workers to transcribe newspaper summaries of liberal or conservative court decisions about obscenity. We find that liberal obscenity decisions liberalize individual and perceived community standards and increase utility. Yet religious workers become more conservative in their values, identify as more Republican, view community standards as becoming more liberal, and report lower utility. Workers update beliefs about the prevalence of sexual activities differently in response to liberal or conservative decisions. These results provide causal evidence for the law having indirect social effects that may amplify or attenuate deterrence effects and suggest that legitimacy of law can affect utility and self-identification.

Subsidies for retirement accounts, which rely on individuals to take an action to raise savings, primarily induce individuals to shift assets from taxable accounts to retirement accounts. We estimate that each $1 of government expenditure on subsidies increases total saving by only 1 cent. In contrast, policies that raise retirement contributions if individuals take no action-such as automatic employer contributions to retirement accounts-increase wealth accumulation substantially. We estimate that approximately 15% of individuals are active savers who respond to tax subsidies primarily by shifting assets across accounts; 85% of individuals are passive savers who are unresponsive to subsidies but are instead heavily influenced by automatic contributions made on their behalf. Active savers tend to be wealthier and more financially sophisticated. We conclude that automatic contributions are more effective at increasing savings rates than subsidies for three reasons: (i) subsidies induce relatively few individuals to respond, (ii) they generate substantial crowd-out conditional on response, and (iii) they do not increase the savings of passive individuals, who are least prepared for retirement.","[Chetty, Raj] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Copenhagen,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Nielsen, Torben Heien/0000-0002-0477-5626; Leth-Petersen, Soren/0000-0002-5585-3102",,,,,49,216,247,4,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

While not exhibiting the second-order bias the OLS estimator has in this setup, IVX estimators have reduced rates of convergence when the regressors are highly persistent. The reduced convergence rates may sometimes lead to power losses in finite samples when testing for no predictability, for instance. The note discusses a simple way of improving the local power of IVX-based tests, consisting of augmenting the predictive regression with the lagged dependent variable. This implies a feed-back loop which strengthens the signal of the IVX instrument without changing its dynamic properties. The proposed augmentation works best when the power loss of IVX would have been maximal compared to the infeasible OLS-based test. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In our experiment, we manipulated the availability of cognitive resources by applying a differential cognitive load. In cognitive load experiments, subjects are directed to perform a task which occupies cognitive resources, in addition to making a choice in another domain. The greater the cognitive resources required for the task implies that fewer such resources are available for deliberation on the choice. In our experiment, subjects played a finitely repeated multi-player prisoner's dilemma game under two cognitive load treatments. In one treatment, subjects were placed under a high cognitive load (given a 7 digit number to recall) and subjects in the other were placed under a low cognitive load (given a 2 digit number). According to two different measures, we find evidence that the low load subjects behaved more strategically. First, the low load subjects exhibited more strategic defection near the end of play than the high load subjects. Second, we find evidence that low load subjects were better able to condition their behavior on the outcomes of previous periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using the Panel Analysis of Non-stationarity in Idiosyncratic and Common Components (PANIC), a non-stationary common factor is detected in the real interest rate. This may reflect permanent common shifts in e.g. time preferences, risk aversion and the steady-state growth rate of technological change. We therefore control for an unobserved non-stationary common factor in estimating the Fisher equation using both the Common Correlated Effects Pooled (CCEP) and the Continuously Updated (Cup) estimation approach.

A study of small business distress in Spain,SERIES-JOURNAL OF THE SPANISH ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bankruptcy; Mortgage; Insolvency,ENFORCEMENT; CREDIT; FIRMS; LAW,"Small businesses, the majority of Spanish firms, rarely file for formal bankruptcy when dealing with financial distress. This is why business bankruptcy rates in Spain are among the lowest in the world, even during the current economic crisis. To explain this fact we present the following hypothesis. Filing for bankruptcy in Spain is very costly for both small firms and their creditors. Due to this, the capital structure of micro firms is biased towards mortgage loans, as it allows them to avoid bankruptcy by carrying out debt enforcement via mortgage foreclosures, which are cheaper procedures than bankruptcy, in case of financial distress. The empirical tests of our hypothesis consist of comparing the observed choices (choice of capital structure, choice between bankruptcy and mortgage) of Spanish firms with those of firms from countries (France and the UK) where their bankruptcy systems are more efficient and their laws do not incentivise them to bias their capital structure towards mortgage loans. Our findings corroborate the proposed hypothesis. As bankruptcy procedures and mortgage foreclosures are not perfect substitutes-i.e., they do not suit well the same type of firms- the underutilization of one of them-reflected in low bankruptcy rates- may lead to efficiency losses.","[Garcia-Posada, Miguel; Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S.] Banco Espana, Eurosyst, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"García-Posada, M (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Eurosyst, Madrid, Spain.",miguel.garcia-posada@bde.es,"Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./AAK-2001-2021","Mora-Sanguinetti, Juan S./0000-0003-0964-784X",,,,,45,15,15,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

For doing so, we adopt a simple one-sector endogenous growth model modified under tax evasion following the Roubini and Sala-i-Martin (1995) analysis on income taxes and tax compliance. Our model confirms Barro's (1990) theoretical finding stating that the optimal tax rate is equal to the elasticity of public capital. However, introducing a welfare function where governments care also about the degree of fiscal corruption in the economy, the effective tax rate is lower than the output elasticity of public capital in line with Futagami et al. (1993) and Turnovsky (1997) theoretical results. Finally, our model is calibrated using data on tax evasion from 35 OECD and 110 non-OECD countries for 2011. Simulation results suggest that both tax evasion and output growth are decreasing with the share of tax revenues allocated to monitoring expenses, while government's utility maximization imply an announced tax rate lower from the elasticity of public capital for both groups of countries.

Two states reflect price volatility: 'high prices' and 'low prices'. We argue that whether or not political transition (i.e., a switch from one regime to another) will take place in a particular state depends critically on the kind of goods a country produces. If the main economic activity in a country is the extraction of point-source resources such as oil that demands capital-intensive production, the opportunity cost of switching the existing regime does not alter if the price of the resource changes but the benefit becomes more lucrative. Therefore, the incumbent group is most vulnerable during 'high prices'. If the main economic activity of the nations is the production of diffused resources such as coffee that requires labor, prices do affect the opportunity cost.

Domestic producers choose an optimal capital structure and finance capital goods through credit, bonds and equity assets. Private households hold a portfolio of domestic and foreign assets, shift balances depending on risk-return considerations, and maximise real consumption in accordance with the law of one price. Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that central bank interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital. The application of expansive monetary interventions throughout the course of economic crises maintains the domestic stock of real capital at the cost of inflation, currency devaluation, distortions of interest rates and asset prices, and risk clusters on the central bank's balance sheet.

The argument is made that contingent commission payments encourage brokers to select insurers for their clients based on the potential to earn contingent commissions, rather than on the needs of the insured. We argue that contingent commission payments, which while directly paid by the insurer are ultimately paid by the insured through higher premiums, are beneficial to insureds because they provide an incentive for the broker to place their coverage with an insurer that is charging an adequate premium. We contend that although inadequate premiums are perhaps good for the insured in the short term, in the longer term, inadequate premiums will result in price hikes or coverage restrictions that are harmful to the insureds. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that insurers who pay contingent commissions experience less price fluctuation over the underwriting cycle than insurers who do not pay contingent commissions in the US property and casualty insurance industry.","[Browne, Mark J.] St Johns Univ, Tobin Coll Business, Queens, NY USA; [Ju, Lan; Tu, Zhiyong] Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Saint John's University; Peking University,"Ju, L (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, HSBC Business Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",julan@phbs.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,39,4,4,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The extent of destruction is increasing in the extent of political marginalization of the affected group. Resistance not only destroys economic surplus; It also mutes the investor's incentives to create surplus. The government uses a tax/subsidy on the investor to maximize weighted social surplus, and we show that the possibility of destruction may force the government to be too soft in its negotiations with the investor.

Often standardized reactor designs are required to be locally adapted, which often impacts the project plans and the supply chain. It then becomes difficult to ascertain how these changes will eventually reflect in costs, which makes the capital costs component of nuclear power plants uncertain. Different nuclear reactor types compete economically by having either lower and less uncertain construction costs, increased efficiencies, lower and less uncertain fuel cycles and O&M costs etc. The decision making process related to nuclear power plants requires a holistic approach that takes into account the key economic factors and their uncertainties. We here present a decision-support tool that satisfactorily takes into account the major uncertainties in the cost elements of a nuclear power plant, to provide an optimal portfolio of nuclear reactors. The portfolio so obtained, under our model assumptions and the constraints considered, maximizes the combined returns for a given level of risk or uncertainty. These decisions are made using a combination of real option theory and mean-variance portfolio optimization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These games are widely studied using either simulations or laboratory experiments. Simulations can show the dynamics of aggregate behavior, but the results of such simulations depend on the type of strategies used. So far experiments provided little guidance on the type of strategies people use because the set of possible strategies is very large. We therefore use a multi-round strategy method experiment to directly elicit people's strategies. Between rounds participants can adjust their strategy and test the performance of (possible) new strategies against strategies from the previous round. Strategies gathered in the experiment are subjected to an evolutionary competition. The strategies people use are very heterogeneous although aggregate outcomes resemble the symmetric Nash equilibrium. The strategies that survive evolutionary competition achieve much higher levels of coordination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using a comprehensive CSR index covering ten dimensions, we analyse the CSR disclosures in a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries. The CSR disclosure index shows that Islamic banks engage across the range of social activities, both as individual banks and as countries. However Islamic banks seem to show more commitment to the vision and mission, the board and top management, and the financial product/services dimensions, whilst least attention is paid to the environment dimension. Islamic banks also show a considerable awareness of the mandatory disclosure recommendations of the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) however, they pay less attention to the voluntary CSR disclosure. Moreover, we find a pronounced emphasis in Islamic banks strategy towards more universal disclosures, suggesting the legitimacy of these banks is reinforced through disclosure to the wider stakeholder community. The empirical analysis highlights a positive association between CSR disclosure and financial performance. We also find a positive and highly significant association between the Shari'ah supervisory board (SSB) size and CSR disclosure index. Finally, the results of the three-stage least squares estimation show that the causality between the two endogenous variables runs from financial performance to CSR disclosure. Thus CSR disclosure is determined by financial performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This learning process is consistent with a number of key facts about occupational mobility, such as the offsetting worker flows across occupations, the non-random patterns of occupational transitions, and the decline of occupational switching with age. We illustrate how search frictions delay learning and lead to mismatch, thereby reducing worker productivity. Moreover, we explore how different workers perform in different occupations. Are the best workers in one occupation also the best workers in another occupation (one-dimensional model of ability)? Or are some workers good at one occupation and other workers good at a different one (comparative advantage model)? The calibration favours the model of comparative advantage, as opposed to the widely used one-dimensional ability model.

The results show that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among non-renewable and renewable energy sources, industrial output and economic growth. The panel causality analyses show bidirectional causality between industrial output and both renewable and non-renewable energy consumption in the short and long run. However, there is evidence of bidirectional short-run relationship between GDP growth and non-renewable energy consumption while unidirectional causality between GDP growth and renewable energy consumption. These results indicate that OECD economies still remain energy-dependent for their industrial output as well as overall economic growth.

The institutional mechanisms underlying the policy system that promotes implementation of energy saving are identified An analytical framework is developed to identify the strategic responses of provincial governments and the factors shaping their responses. Comprehensive sets of provincial data on economic and energy performance are collected and analyzed. The findings indicate that the central government's credible commitment to implement the policy system drove the initially disparate attitudes of provinces to a converged outcome. However, the outcome is significantly constrained by provinces' initial energy intensity. In particular, provincial governments have applied strategies of ceremonial implementation, efficiency-oriented efforts and effectiveness-focused efforts to attain specific targets.

The results provide evidence that a person with high risk preference is less likely to hold health insurance, and spends less on healthcare even when controlling for insurance.","[Condliffe, Simon; Fiorentino, Gregory T.] West Chester Univ Penn, W Chester, PA 19383 USA",,"Condliffe, S (通讯作者)，West Chester Univ Penn, 323D Anderson Hall, W Chester, PA 19383 USA.",scondliffe@wcupa.edu,,,,,,,8,6,6,7,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To this end, this research study examines from portfolio managers' standpoint the performance of optimum and investable portfolios subject to applying meaningful financial and operational constraints as a result of a financial turmoil. Specifically, the paper tests a number of alternative scenarios considering both long-only and long and short-sales positions subject to minimizing the Liquidity-Adjusted Value-at-Risk (LVaR) and various financial and operational constraints such as target expected return, portfolio trading volume, close-out periods and portfolio weights. Robust optimization algorithms to set coherent asset allocations for investment management industries in emerging markets and particularly in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) financial markets are developed. The results show that the obtained investable portfolios lie off the efficient frontier, but that long-only portfolios appear to lie much closer to the frontier than portfolios including both long and short-sales positions. The proposed optimization algorithms can be useful in developing enterprise-wide portfolio management models in light of the aftermaths of the most-recent financial crisis. The developed methodology and risk optimization algorithms can aid in advancing portfolio management practices in emerging markets and predominantly in the wake of the latest credit crunch.

We find that on the basis of any reasonable division of existing assets and liabilities, Scotland would begin its independence with a substantial debt burden and less scope for risk-sharing with the rest of the UK. In order to reduce this debt burden, an independent Scotland would have to adopt a restrictive fiscal stance for many years. We estimate that Scotland would need to run primary surpluses of 3.1 per cent annually in order to achieve a Maastricht definition debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 per cent after 10 years of independence.

In the field of economics, however, it is less frequently used, and those that do use it are usually not professionally trained economists. One of the reasons for this is the perceived ideological differences between system dynamics modelling and neoclassical economics. System dynamics is classified in the literature as a heterodox approach. This article utilises a reputable framework from social theory to compare system dynamics modelling and neoclassical economics on ontological and epistemological grounds. This is the first known study to find congruency between these two approaches on this basis. System dynamics modelling has the potential to increase the range of modelling tools at the disposal of neoclassical economics, so long dominated by econometric and general equilibrium modelling approaches.","[Crookes, Douglas J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [De Wit, Martin P.] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, ZA-7561 Brackenfell, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"Crookes, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",d_crookes@hotmail.com,"de wit, martin p/A-1851-2017","de wit, martin p/0000-0003-3054-2479; Crookes, Douglas/0000-0001-9357-5396",,,,,57,10,10,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Different from most studies, we consider the unique symmetric entry equilibrium, which is in mixed strategies. We identify two effects of market transparency on welfare: a competition effect and a novel market-structure effect. We show, surprisingly, that for almost all demand functions the negative market-structure effect eventually dominates the positive competition effect as the market becomes increasingly transparent. Consumer-side market transparency can therefore be socially excessive even without collusion.

However, though the impact on firm performance of market institutions and pyramidal affiliations persists briefly post-listing with firms recording lower EPS and higher raw returns in the first year, it does not help predict whether firms remain listed abroad in 2012.

These changes provide us with a unique opportunity to examine the impact of primary school availability on children's educational attainment.

The transaction costs of defining the property rights to mitigation benefits and costs is a useful framework for such analysis. This approach views international cooperation as a contractual process among country leaders to assign those property rights. Leaders cooperate when it serves domestic interests to do so. The demand for property rights comes from those who value and stand to gain from multilateral action. Property rights are supplied by international agreements that specify resource access and use, assign costs and benefits including outlining the size and duration of compensating transfer payments, and determining who will pay and who will receive them. Four factors raise the transaction costs of assigning property rights: (i) scientific uncertainty regarding mitigation benefits and costs; (ii) varying preferences and perceptions across heterogeneous populations; (iii) asymmetric information; and (iv) the extent of compliance and new entry. These factors are used to examine the role of transaction costs in the establishment and allocation of property rights to provide globally valued national parks, implement the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, execute the Montreal Protocol to manage emissions that damage the stratospheric ozone layer, set limits on harvest of highly-migratory ocean fish stocks, and control greenhouse gas emissions.","[Libecap, Gary D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Libecap, Gary D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Libecap, Gary D.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Libecap, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,,341,46,51,2,80,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

In a simple new Keynesian environment it is assumed that private sector conditions its own expectations to central bank's forecasts. Private sector's prior expectations are estimated in each period in accordance with the adaptive learning scheme, and successively updated with a signal based on central bank's forecasts. Using both analytical and numerical calculations it is shown that the economy's dynamics is affected by central bank's ability to correctly assess the effect of the signal. In particular, if the central bank takes into account the impact of signals on private agents' expectations the economic dynamics is less volatile. Moreover, if a fundamentals based signal includes a stochastic component unrelated to the economy, the strategy of communicating expectations to the private sector may perform worst than in the case of a totally uninformative signal.

This paper presents a novel rationale for sales that does not rely on consumer heterogeneity, or on any form of randomness to explain such periodic price fluctuations. The analysis is carried out in the context of a simple repeated price competition model, and establishes that firms must periodically reduce prices in order to sustain collusion when goods are storable and the market is large. The largest equilibrium profits are characterized at any market size. A trade-off between the size of the industry and its profits arises. Sales foster collusion, by magnifying the inter-temporal links in consumers' decisions.","[Nava, Francesco; Schiraldi, Pasquale] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Nava, F (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England.",f.nava@lse.ac.uk; p.schiraldi@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,3,3,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The exit of privatized SOEs can have a profound impact on employment and on the development of local economies of transitional countries. An oligopoly model that incorporates country-level trade costs and individual SOE's productivity is developed to assess the exit of SOEs under either foreign or domestic ownership. The model shows that market competition between firms can lead to liquidation of the SOE by a domestic firm when trade costs increase. When the productivity of SOE is high, neither foreign nor domestic firm will liquidate. The predictions of the model are tested using firm-level privatization data from Central and Eastern Europe. By controlling for productivity, trade costs, and other attributes of SOEs after privatization, it is found that foreign ownership significantly reduces the probability of SOE's exit as compared to domestic ownership. Furthermore, there is evidence that as trade costs increase, the exit probability of domestically owned SOEs increases and the exit probability of foreign-owned SOEs declines.","Alfred Univ, Coll Business, Alfred, NY 14802 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Alfred University,"Pac, G (通讯作者)，Alfred Univ, Coll Business, 1 Saxon Dr, Alfred, NY 14802 USA.",pac@alfred.edu,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Our main findings are as follows. First, under the IT framework, Korea has followed an inflation responsive rule in a forward-looking manner, while Thailand has adopted the rule in a backward-looking manner. Second, only Korea experiences a reduction in the pass-through effect under IT adoption, thereby showing a linkage between the forward-looking inflation responsive rule and the pass-through effect.

The presumption is that asset purchases by the Federal Reserve (Fed) benefit everyone. The policy involves increasing the prices of treasury bonds and mortgage-backed assets to stimulate output and employment. Quantitative easing acts on balance sheets. It works through the price system by affecting the structure of prices, and hence wealth. The unemployed, lacking assets, are not directly affected by changes in asset prices. The unemployed are dependent on policies that generate income. While Fed intervention prevented a collapse in asset prices, its effect on the real economy remains tenuous. Data suggests that the policy has exacerbated the inequality in the distribution of wealth and income, has done little to reduce unemployment, and has violated the principles of social justice. The policy contrast sharply with fiscal policy employed during WWII, which promoted greater equality in the distribution of income.","Westminster Coll, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA",,"Watkins, JP (通讯作者)，Westminster Coll, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 USA.",,,,,,,,18,9,13,2,23,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

By using the system GMM estimator, we show that the employment-productivity growth trade-off does not exist. Moreover, we find significant complementarities between employment and productivity growth, mostly driven by SMEs and firms from high-tech industries. Accordingly, we argue that the job-creation policy and productivity-promoting policy are complementary rather than trade-offs and that policymakers should focus on the optimal policy mix that provides the highest aggregate effect with regard to all growth aspects. Further, significant differences among the factors of employment and productivity growth suggest that job-creation policy measures are most successful when targeted at younger export-oriented firms with high total factor productivity levels and capital-intensive production. Meanwhile, the outcome of policy measures aimed at promoting productivity increases with a firm's capital intensity and size up to the threshold employment level and with the intensity of market competition.","[Ponikvar, Nina; Kejzar, Katja Zajc] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Ponikvar, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",nina.ponikvar@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Ponikvar, Nina/0000-0003-3976-211X",,,,,31,0,0,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To examine this issue properly one needs to have a measure of the share of domestic value added that is effectively embodied in Mexico's exports. We analyse firm-level data from the Manufacturing Industry, maquiladora and Export Services Program census which covers all the firms that benefit from the Maquiladora and the Program of Temporary Imports to Produce Export Goods programs. We find that the share of domestic value added as a proportion of the firm's exports has been declining in the last 6years. We show that the decline is not the result of market share reallocations; that it persists after controlling for price changes and that is observed across firms of all sizes. The results suggest that more segments of the supply chains are generally not moving into Mexico and that on the contrary there is a trend of falling domestic value added. This result contrasts with that of other countries engaged in similar export processing activities, like China.","Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Inter-American Development Bank,"Blyde, JS (通讯作者)，Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",juanbl@iadb.org,,,,,,,3,6,7,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

State regulators counteract these downgrades to some degree by upgrading more frequently. Under federal regulators, banks report worse asset quality, higher regulatory capital ratios, and lower return on assets. Leniency of state regulators relative to their federal counterparts is related to costly outcomes, such as higher failure rates and lower repayment rates of government assistance funds. The discrepancy in regulator behavior is related to different weights given by regulators to local economic conditions and, to some extent, differences in regulatory resources. We find no support for regulator self-interest, which includes revolving doors as a reason for leniency of state regulators.","[Agarwal, Sumit] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore; Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ British Columbia, Natl Bur Econ Researc, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",National University of Singapore; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia,"Agarwal, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",amit.seru@chicagobooth.edu,"Trebbi, Francesco/GVS-4548-2022; Agarwal, Sumit/F-4836-2012; Trebbi, Francesco/AAD-5940-2019","Agarwal, Sumit/0000-0002-8305-3786;",,,,,48,166,198,3,97,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The rules for the initial allocation of emission allowances have not been decided yet. This paper assesses the effect of various initial emission allowance allocation methods of the Korean electricity market. This study employs the mixed complementarity problem, which is able to incorporate operation, investment, and emission trade decisions in the deregulated electricity market in order to provide more realistic results. In particular, the allocation rules to existing plants and new entrants are modeled separately in this study. The model quantifies the impacts of different allocation rules on emissions, capacity mix, emission allowance prices, electricity prices, and social welfare. We examine typical allocation rules such as auction to all power plants, best available technology (BAT) benchmark to all power plants, fuel-specific benchmark to existing power plants along with BAT benchmark to new entrants, and fuel-specific benchmark to all power plants. We find that giving free allocations to new power plants prompts more new investment and this raises overall social welfare even though the direct cost of achieving the emission reduction target rises. While the auction is the most powerful policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, giving away permits to all power plants based on a fuel-specific benchmark encourages investment, increases output, and leads to a greater level of welfare from an imperfectly competitive industry.

Demonstrating this empirically has been difficult, however, because of endogeneity concerns and other challenges. In this paper we use a regression discontinuity analysis to examine participation in a large-scale residential energy-efficiency program. Comparing behavior just on either side of several eligibility thresholds, we find that program participation increases with larger subsidy amounts, but that most households would have participated even with much lower subsidy amounts. The large fraction of inframarginal participants means that the larger subsidy amounts are almost certainly not cost-effective. Moreover, the results imply that about half of all participants would have adopted the energy-efficient technology even with no subsidy whatsoever. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical framework is a two-sector supply-side model of a small open economy with endogenous industrial structure and cross-sectoral subsidies. First, we show how a larger cross-sectoral productivity growth differential positively affects growth when industrial structure is given exogenously. Distinct industrial structures lead to distinct regimes: high growth and low inflation and low growth and high inflation, respectively. Second, we endogenize the industrial structure. The condition under which a higher productivity growth differential positively affects growth is now related to an economy's structural flexibility. Distinguishing between regimes of a widening productivity growth gap across sectors, and, respectively, regimes of a narrowing gap, allows for a more refined assessment regarding which industrial structures are most favorable to growth. Alternative evolutions of industrial structure are associated with distinct transition trajectories.","[Borgersen, Trond-Arne; King, Roswitha M.] Ostfold Univ Coll, Ostfold, Norway",Ostfold University College,"Borgersen, TA (通讯作者)，Ostfold Univ Coll, Ostfold, Norway.",,,"Borgersen, Trond Arne/0000-0002-0105-8883",,,,,29,9,9,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We conduct a disaggregated analysis using the Phillips curve for individual price indexes. We find that more than 55 percent of the categories react to the output gap. According to our expectations, the categories most closely linked to the output gap are services and nondurable goods. We identify that only a small share of prices of durable and semidurable goods react to domestic demand, which can be explained to some extent by the globalization process. We also find that more than one-third of the price indexes respond to exchange rate movements-mostly durable and semidurable goods.","[Halka, Aleksandra; Kotlowski, Jacek] Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland; [Kotlowski, Jacek] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Warsaw School of Economics,"Halka, A (通讯作者)，Narodowy Bank Polski, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,20,9,9,0,2,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Inequality of household income has also remained high, which leads to the question: is there income mobility in the Philippines? Using longitudinal data from three years of the redesigned Philippine Family Income and Expenditure Survey (2003, 2006, and 2009) and a variety of analytical tools, we examine the mobility of Filipino household income and show that it is less stagnant than is conventionally perceived. Empirical evidence suggests that significant positive and negative mobility exists; albeit, the two tend to offset each other, contributing to slow household income growth at the aggregate level. In addition, there is some evidence that transitory fluctuations contribute significantly to the observed level of income mobility. Overall, the findings are robust across different analytical tools used in measuring income mobility.","[Martinez, Arturo, Jr.; Western, Mark; Haynes, Michele; Tomaszewski, Wojtek] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Martinez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",,"Haynes, Michele A/G-9389-2013; Western, Mark C/C-4757-2008; Tomaszewski, Wojtek/M-7379-2013","Western, Mark C/0000-0001-5399-6911; Tomaszewski, Wojtek/0000-0003-4144-8613; Haynes, Michele/0000-0003-2718-3954",,,,,31,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

In a fraction of matches, buyers can use unmatured bonds together with money to purchase goods. In other matches, a legal restriction forbids the use of bonds as the means of payments. In this economy, a shock to bond sales has two distinct liquidity effects. One is the immediate liquidity effect on the bond price and the nominal interest rate. The other is a liquidity effect in the goods market starting one period later, which arises as unmatured bonds facilitate trades. Thus, even independent shocks in the open market can have persistent effects on interest rates and real output.

Under a convex tax schedule, profits are taxed at a higher rate, while losses are taxed (or rebated) at a lower rate, thus reducing the risk shared by the government. This article presents a dynamic model based on the contingent-claims framework to explore the impacts of tax convexity on the triggers, and we find that the impacts vary significantly depending on several countervailing forces. Tax convexity has a nonmonotonic relationship with both the default and investment triggers, because of the government's risk-sharing role. The default trigger is higher when tax convexity increases, while the growth option exerts a counteracting effect that lowers this trigger, creating an ambiguity in the investment trigger when changing the level of tax asymmetry.","[Lei, Adrian C.

The empirical findings indicate that the microfinance industry has reported overall productivity regress in the study period even though all the MENA MFIs have positive TFP growth with the exception of the year 2010-2011. In addition, our study indicates that over the period the Malmquist productivity change experienced by the MENA microfinance industry as a whole has averaged 4.9% annually which was mainly attributed to technical efficiency change. The study reveals also that the industry as a whole has exhibited a decline in technological change (2.9% decrease over the period) and suggested that there has been a deterioration in the performance of the best practicing MFIs. By decomposing the Malmquist index, the result showed that during the study period the MENA MFIs have experienced mainly an increment of pure technical efficiency (improvement in management practices) rather than an improvement in optimum size. Overall, an essential strategic implication for the MENA microfinance industry is that they need to pursue a technological progress in order to meet the dual objectives of reaching many poor people and financial sustainability.

Workers are endowed with heterogeneous abilities and, as a result of economic turbulence, can undergo a depredation of their human capital during unemployment spells. Firms take inefficient training decision because they do not fully valuate the additional productivity of the workers in future jobs (poaching externality) and the additional employability after separation (unemployment externality). Higher turbulence reduces the former externality and increases the latter. It then generates some opposite forces on the gap between efficient and equilibrium training, so that it does not necessarily require higher training subsidies. The general equilibrium analysis shows that, even if the Hosios condition holds, unemployment is higher than its efficient level, which requires an additional instrument such as ability-specific employment subsidies. We lastly run some computational experiments based on the French economy to illustrate these results: optimal subsidies are found to increase with turbulence, and the total subsidy turns out to be decreasing with wages, with an efficient rate that is reduced by three from the lowest to the highest wages.

In particular, we consider the shape of reduced preferences that emerge in the equilibrium of a two-sided matching model with non-transferable utility. Cole et al. (1992, 1995) show that, under full observability of potential mates' attributes, instrumental concerns for social status are ordinal, i.e., only one's own rank in the distribution of attributes matters. We show that when we depart from full observability, instrumental concerns for social status become cardinal, i.e., also other features of the distribution of attributes matter. We also show that the actual shape of cardinal concerns depends on how individuals can deal with the informational asymmetry, alternatively leading to upward concerns, i.e., making comparisons with higher rank people; downward concerns, i.e., making comparisons with lower rank people; or bidirectional concerns, i.e, being both upward and downward.

Level-n expectations are recursively defined in a way that a player holding level-n expectations correctly predicts the action of an opponent holding level-(n-1) expectations. A general conceptual framework to study such dynamics for two-stage games is developed and it is shown that, contrary to results for single-stage games, the fixed points of the dynamics depend on the level of the expectations. In particular, for level-0 expectation, fixed points correspond to a Nash equilibrium of a simultaneous move version of the game, whereas (under certain conditions) fixed points converge towards the subgame perfect equilibrium of the two-stage game if the level of expectations goes to infinity. The approach is illustrated using a two-stage duopoly game, where firms in the first stage invest in activities reducing their marginal costs and in the second stage engage in Cournot competition. Conditions for local stability of the fixed points are derived for different levels of expectations and it is shown that level-2 expectations are sufficient to move the fixed-point of the dynamics to a close neighborhood of the subgame perfect equilibrium. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that although firms benefit from unilateral increases in the level of expectations, an increase of n by all firms reduces all profits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These aspects of the grand gender convergence are figurative chapters in a history of gender roles. But what must the last chapter contain for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve government intervention and it need not make men more responsible in the home (although that wouldn't hurt). But it must involve changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours. Such change has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal worlds.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Goldin, C (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 229 Littauer, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cgoldin@harvard.edu,,,,,,,50,846,1046,109,303,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We analyze the ratio of fares charged for various qualities within the menu to the fares charged for the lowest quality nonrefundable, restricted tickets. We observe a fare compression for only the highest fares on only the most concentrated (i.e., monopoly) routes. This result is something of a puzzle given a monopolist's market power.

What factors of the urban environment are important for attracting the location of CIs? How is the development of CIs in a city influenced by its neighbouring cities and its early development? To answer these questions, three types of spatial panel models - the spatial lag model, the spatial error model and the spatial dynamic panel model - are employed using the urban statistics for China from 2003 to 2009. Human capital, diversified industrial structure and transportation and communication infrastructure are significant factors contributing to the development of CIs. The empirical findings reveal the presence of positive spatial spillovers among cities, which suggests that promoting CIs in one city benefits other cities. Also, the evidence suggests the presence of temporal spillovers, implying that the early concentration of CIs in a city tends to attract more CIs in that city.","[Ko, Kwan Wai] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mok, Kin Wai Patrick] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Ko, KW (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kwan.ko@cuhk.edu.hk; pat730@hku.hk,,,,,,,29,7,9,1,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Profits' share is strongly pro-cyclical. It neither leads nor lags output, and its volatility is about five times that of output. Those assumptions relate to the structure of aggregate technology and the degree of competition in factor markets. Despite much evidence in favor of time-varying income shares, macroeconomics still lacks models that can account for their time series facts. This article constructs a model that can replicate those facts. We introduce costly entry of firms in a model with frictional labor markets and find a link between the ability of the model to replicate income shares' dynamics and the ability of the model to amplify and propagate shocks. That link is a weak correlation between the real interest rate and output, a fact in U.S. data but a feature that models of aggregate fluctuations have had difficulty achieving.

In this paper I study public debt dynamics in a two-country monetary union where a representative, risk-averse wealth-owner optimizes his/her portfolio of sovereign bonds issued in the common currency. I obtain two main results with respect to the standard country-by-country approach. First, the interest-rate spread between the two countries is endogenized as the higher-debt country pays a risk premium which is proportional to the level of its own debt with respect to the debt of the other. Second, its debt dynamic path becomes nonlinear and dependent on the evolution of the other country's debt. The most important policy implication is that dynamic interdependence is not fully considered in the implementation of EMU fiscal rules, but it may may jeopardize their goal of convergence and stability of debt stocks.","Univ Trent, Dept Econ & Management, I-38100 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Tamborini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Trent, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38100 Trento, Italy.",roberto.tamborini@unitn.it,"Tamborini, Roberto/H-4183-2019",,,,,,17,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Hours worked increased in Turkey since 2009 and the model accounts for half of that increase between 2009 and 2011. Our findings suggest that time-varying taxes on consumption and labor play significant roles in explaining the hours worked in Turkey.

To counter the incentive to prioritize revenue-generating patients, the law also prohibits facilities from delaying care to under-insured individuals. I estimate whether timeliness of emergency care is, in fact, unaffected by payer source as mandated. Using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, I first examine the direct effect of under-insurance and find that under-insurance is associated with an approximately 6-10 % increase in emergency department wait time. Because of concerns that the effects of under-insurance may be mediated by triage assignment, I subsequently estimate the relationship between under-insurance and triage assignment, using the office hours of general practitioners as an exogenous source of variation in payer source. Instrumental variable results suggest that under-insured patients are inexplicably assigned higher triage scores which are known to lengthen waits. Contrary to the stipulations of EMTALA, discrepancies in timeliness of care do exist. Yet, this noncompliance is not readily apparent; roughly 80 % of the increase in under-insured individuals' wait times are masked by adjustments to triage scores.","Univ Florida, Dept Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Woodworth, L (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Econ, POB 117140, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",lindsey.woodworth@warrington.ufl.edu,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

While the authors' primitive (first-stage) examination has the network generation mechanism as its main focus, their more in-depth second-stage analysis is based on a few main characteristics of network topologies, such as the degree, clustering coefficient, length, and centrality. Based on their econometric analysis of the simulation results, the authors find that the betweenness centrality contributes to the GDP instability and average path length contributes to the inflation instability. These results are robust under two augmentations, one taking into account nonlinearity and one taking into account the shape of the degree distribution as an additional characteristic. Through these augmentations, the authors find that the effect of network topologies on economic stability can be more intriguing than their baseline model may suggest: in addition to the existence of non-linear or combined effects of network characteristics, the shape of the degree distribution is also found to be significant.","[Chen, Shu-Heng; Chang, Chia-Ling; Wen, Ming-Chang] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",chen.shuheng@gmail.com,,"Chen, Shu-Heng/0000-0003-4584-7646",,,,,53,2,2,1,29,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 26,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201416,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-16,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339610500002,0

Thus, when a firm undertaking a project requires an outside supplier (e.g., an equipment manufacturer) to provide it with a discrete input to serve a growing but uncertain demand, and if the supplier has market power, investment occurs too late from an industry standpoint. The distortion in firm decisions is characterized by a Lerner-type index. Despite the underlying investment option, greater volatility can result in a lower value for both firms. We examine several contractual alternatives to induce efficient timing, a novel vertical restraint being for the upstream to sell a call option on the input. We also extend the model to allow for downstream duopoly. When downstream firms are engaged in a preemption race, the upstream firm sells the input to the first investor at a discount such that the race to preempt exactly offsets the vertical distortion, and this leader invests at the optimal time.

The accounting framework to achieving this objective is considered, focused on the role of asset registers. Particular attention is paid to renewable assets at risk of falling below critical thresholds. These assets are key components of the balance sheet. Capital maintenance expenditures are required to maintain the value of assets intact, since renewable natural assets should not be depreciated, but rather treated as assets in perpetuity. Within the aggregate, substitutions with other forms of capital are permitted, but only if there is compensation for any detriment to natural capital. Offsetting is one mechanism for achieving this compensation. The case for enhancing the aggregate is considered, and the paper shows how a broader national plan over a generation could contribute to the policy objective of leaving the next generation with a richer endowment of natural capital. The policy instruments for embedding natural capital into public policy are reviewed.","New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk,,,,,,,30,22,22,6,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

A recent EU reform limits the scope for this type of tax evasion by introducing a withholding tax on interest income earned by EU households in Switzerland and several other offshore centers. This paper estimates the impact of the withholding tax on Swiss bank deposits held by EU residents while using non-EU residents who were not subject to the tax as a comparison group. We present evidence that Swiss bank deposits owned by EU residents declined by 30-40% relative to other Swiss bank deposits in two quarters immediately before and after the tax was introduced. We also present evidence suggesting that the drop in Swiss bank deposits was driven by behavioral responses aiming to escape the tax - such as the transfer of funds to bank accounts in other offshore centers and the transfer of formal ownership of Swiss bank accounts to offshore holding companies - rather than repatriation of funds.

N. Whitehead argued that the idea of the identity of the self is one of the significant mistakes made by modern philosophy. From this postmodern perspective, this article examines how this mistaken concept underlies the modern ownership schemes of property, trusts and finance. It argues that exploiting the hybridity of money and credit explains the development of modern ownership from property to trusts and modern finance, and that, in the process of exploiting this hybridity, property owners struggle to endure and secure their identities permanently. This article also analyses unethical aspects of the hybridity of modern finance, as well as its systemic vulnerability, which contributed to the financial crisis of 2008.

Despite a recent reduction in Russia's exports to Europe, it plans to build new pipelines. We explore the long-term (up to 2050) scenarios of Russian natural gas exports to Europe and Asia using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy. We found that over the next 20-40 years natural gas can still play a substantial role in Russian exports and there are substantial reserves to support a development of the gas-oriented energy system both in Russia and in its current and potential gas importers. Based on the considered scenarios, Russia does not need any new pipeline capacity to the EU unless it wants to diversify its export routes to supply the EU without any gas transit via Ukraine and Belarus. Asian markets are attractive to Russian gas and substantial volumes may be exported there. Relatively cheap shale gas in China may sufficiently alter the prospects of Russian gas, especially in Asian markets. In the Reference scenario, exports of natural gas grow from Russia's current 7 Tcf to 11-12 Tcf in 2030 and 13-14 Tcf in 2050.

As a robustness check, the calculations are carried out for two groups of countries: EU27 during 1993-2010 and EU15 during 1972-2010. The analysis is based on three-year intervals, as contrasted with an analysis by Prochniak and Witkowski (2013a) that is based on annual data. In addition, the paper examines the strength and stability of impact of selected economic growth determinants. In order to verify the research hypotheses, Bayesian model averaging is applied to Blundell and Bond's generalized method of moments system estimator. It turns out that the EU27 countries converged at a rather constant over time rate of about 6 percent per annum while the EU15 countries converged at about 3 percent per annum; this is an enormous difference compared to the widely cited 2 percent speed of convergence in the mainstream literature.","[Prochniak, Mariusz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Witkowski, Bartosz] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Warsaw School of Economics,"Próchniak, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",,,"Witkowski, Bartosz/0000-0003-0940-0265",,,,,31,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

While the skewed distribution of CDM projects across countries is well recognized, little attention has been given to the skewed distribution of CDM projects within a country like India. We examine the different factors that account for the regional distribution of renewable energy based CDM power projects in India using state-specific and renewable form-specific explanatory variables including natural potential, economic conditions, and government policies. We find that state implementation of fiscal incentive measures and CDM benefit-sharing were the most significant factors in locating these projects within the states, apart from natural renewable potential. In the top ten states, controlling for the government incentives and subsidies, the pre-installed renewable power capacity was also a significant factor. State financial incentives and CDM benefit clause were also found to be the most significant factor in the generation of certified emission reductions from CDM projects. Unfortunately states with relatively higher natural potential lost out on the additional product gains through CERs, and an important aspect of the CDM approach seems to have been missed in India - that of promoting development in other regions of the country which had natural potential.

Other variables, that is, real exchange rate, domestic and foreign incomes, terms of trade and foreign exchange market distortions affect exports, imports and trade balance in the theoretically expected directions.

Using data from five major South Asian markets (Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka), our results support the validity of an ICAPM and indicate that the risk is regionally priced. Furthermore, we show that changes in the degree of regional stock market integration are explained principally by the U.S. term premium, and the level of market openness, whatever the measure of currency risk. Finally, and as expected, the degree of stock market integration varies considerably over time and from one market to another. As intense market integration induces both benefits and risks, our findings should have significant implications for economic policies and market regulations in emerging, frontier-emerging and transition countries, particularly for countries from the same region.

Consequently, regionalism and multilateralism change pollution tax and welfare in the tariff-reducing countries in similar ways when pollution is local, but in dissimilar ways for global pollution.

We find that individuals from a minority group face greater danger of being cheated because trade with them is less frequent and the value of a reputation for fairness toward them is correspondingly smaller. When the majority is sufficiently large it can only lose from a solidarity strategy of punishing opportunism against the minority, so a firm that cheats the minority can still continue business as usual with the majority. If there is a small chance that a firm might have an implicit or preference bias against either group, then the interaction with reputational incentives gives unbiased firms an incentive to cheat the minority but not the majority.

This paper examines the economy-wide and food security implications of three of the main policies: a ceiling on prices paid by rice consumers; a floor on prices received by paddy producers; and a subsidy on prices paid for seeds by paddy farmers. These programmes have been subject to domestic criticism on allocative efficiency and distributional grounds. We examine the effects of removing the programmes using an economy-wide model with detailed treatment of agricultural activity, land use, and food security measures. We find that the programmes make a small contribution to food security, for a modest budgetary outlay. The allocative efficiency gains available from ending the programmes are small, and may be outweighed by the potential for adverse short-run macroeconomic consequences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The oil price sensitivity is very weak in the 1990s, a period of fairly stable and low oil prices. Instead, the link between crude oil and stock prices seems to have increased during the 2000s, becoming primarily positive.

At the country level, we identify three distinct aspects of the recent crisis in the euro area affecting firm credit through different channels. Controlling for country fixed effects, the impact of a weak real economy on firm credit operates both by reducing firms' demand for bank financing and by lenders increasing loan rejections and tightening terms and conditions on credit allocated. On the other hand, financial conditions have no significant effect on demand, but they do affect credit supply as we find that financial tensions worsen the chances of obtaining credit and its terms and conditions.

Furthermore, it shows how the impact of more involved parents on their children is amplified at the class level by peer group interaction. We build on a large-scale controlled experiment run in a French deprived educational district, where parents of middle-school children were invited to participate in a simple program of parent-school meetings on how to get better involved in their children's education. At the end of the school year, we find that treated families have increased their school-and home-based involvement activities. In turn, pupils of treatment classes have developed more positive behaviour and attitudes in school, notably in terms of truancy and disciplinary sanctions (with effects-size around 15% of a standard deviation). However, test scores did not improve under the intervention. Our results suggest that parents are an input for schooling policies and it is possible to influence important aspects of the schooling process at low cost.","[Avvisati, Francesco] OECD, Paris, France; [Gurgand, Marc; Maurin, Eric] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Guyon, Nina] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore 117548, Singapore",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Paris School of Economics; National University of Singapore,"Avvisati, F (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,"Guyon, Nina/AAU-8759-2020; Avvisati, Francesco/AAE-5745-2020","Guyon, Nina/0000-0003-3163-4906; Avvisati, Francesco/0000-0001-9354-5234",,,,,32,69,95,0,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Two agents invest into expansion of variety of available products and into the improvement of quality of existing products simultaneously. Every newly introduced product has its own dimension of quality-improving innovations and there is a continuum of possible new products. In the area of quality innovations the costless imitation effect is modelled while in the area of variety expanding innovations agents are cooperating with each other. As a result the specialization of innovative activity is observed. This specialization arises from strategic interactions of agents in both fields of innovative activity and is endogenously defined from the dynamics of the model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper is among the first to study whether patent rights contribute to outward technology transfers. Patent protection can affect the ability of firms to be sources of technology through its effects on innovation and commercialization. Using micro data, this paper finds that patent rights and innovation are positively associated with the exporting and licensing of firms, controlling for other determinants of technological capacity, although the effect is not symmetric across firms in all countries. Patent rights have a strong impact on the export and licensing activities of firms in developed countries, and only on the licensing activities of firms in developing countries. Moreover, transfers of technology develop sequentially - namely, exporting before licensing - due to the differing sunk costs of each type of entry. The results have implications for how innovation policies and activities contribute to the outward orientation of firms.","[Briggs, Kristie] Creighton Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Omaha, NE 68178 USA; [Park, Walter G.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Creighton University; American University,"Park, WG (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",wgp@american.edu,,"Briggs, Kristie/0000-0002-3801-7057",,,,,61,11,11,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

To prevent social security deficits from increasing to unbounded levels of public debt we focus on two policies: reducing the generosity of pension benefits, determined by the government, and postponing the effective retirement age, chosen by employees. An atomistic employee would disregard the effect of his retirement decision on the public debt and would retire as soon as possible. Conversely, an ideal farsighted agency considering all current and future employees would postpone retirement, thereby alleviating the pressure on public debt and allowing a more generous long-run pension. The government may design a proper incentive strategy to induce myopic atomistic decision makers to act nonmyopically. This strategy is a two-part incentive with nonlinear dependence on the stock of public debt. It is credible if deceiving employees slightly adjust their retirement-age decisions to increments in the public debt.","[Cabo, Francisco; Garcia-Gonzalez, Ana] Univ Valladolid, IMUVa, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Cabo, F (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Aplicada Matemat, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid 47011, Spain.",pcabo@eco.uva.es,"Cabo, Francisco/J-9102-2014; Garcia-Gonzalez, Ana/B-1953-2017","Cabo, Francisco/0000-0003-2958-9595; Garcia-Gonzalez, Ana/0000-0002-2670-9574",,,,,22,6,6,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Furthermore, in spite of the impact of the crises of 1998 and 2008 into Russia, this country presented a good recuperation and achieved a high index just after these crises. The Brazilian performance was somewhat surprising. The country showed a low growth rate and a progressive current account deficit, both typical of developed nations, along with a high inflation, typical of developing countries.

We run a regression discontinuity design analysis on a large database of Italian procurement auctions. Auctions with a value above the threshold must be publicized in the Regional Official Gazette and two provincial newspapers. We find that the increased publicity requirement induces more entry and higher winning rebates, which reduces the costs of procurement and rationalizes public spending. The evidence suggests that the number of bidders is the channel through which publicity affects rebates. Increased publicity also selects different winners: it increases the likelihood that the winner hails from outside the region of the public administration and that the winner is a large company. Such companies tend to win repeated auctions gaining market share. Publicity seems to have no adverse effect on the ex-post renegotiations of the works, as measured by the percent of works delivered with delay or that are subcontracted. Estimates are robust to alternative measures of publicity, alternative model specifications, different sample selections, to a falsification analysis at simulated thresholds and to the possibility that firms learn about auctions from a web-based for-profit information provider.

Our application of chaos detecting tools (correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponents) on the price series shows the existence of auto-generated fluctuations. But the ARCH effect test also confirms the existence of randomness. So we used a combined model of chaotic stochastic processes (Mackey-Glass - EGARCH) inspired by the theory of heterogeneous agents to reproduce the prices' characteristics.

On the one hand, we investigate whether the interdependencies (complementary or substitutable) between trade types are significant and hence if they are able to affect trade composition. And on the other, we provide a ranking of the dynamic drivers of trade composition (such as market size, endowments, technology, and consumer tastes and preferences). The econometric analysis reveals evidence of significant interdependencies between some trade components. The results point to technological capital and market size as the most important drivers of Food Products, Beverages & Tobacco in European trade, and suggest some relevant economic policy recommendations to foster industries in the sector and positively influence its pattern of trade.","[Fernandez-Nunez, T.; Marquez, M.

Following the work of Cole and Ohanian (1999) and Kehoe and Prescott (2002, 2007) this twenty year episode can be characterized as a great depression. We use this methodology and ask whether, given the observed exogenous path of total factor productivity (TIP), the neoclassical growth model can generate an equilibrium behavior that has growth accounting characteristics similar to those in the data. The answer is affirmative: Changes in TFP are crucial in accounting for the Greek great depression. Our model economy predicts a big decline of economic activity during the 80s and until the mid-90s and a strong recovery for the period 1995-2001. This is exactly what happened in Greece. Moreover, the model successfully mimics the actual data with respect to the timing of peaks and troughs and the time paths of most key macroeconomic variables. However, puzzles between theory's predictions and the observed data are not missing. For instance, things are (not surprisingly for the neoclassical growth model) less successful when it comes to the labor factor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses an experimental design to directly test this. Data from 1,200 married couples in Ethiopia were collected using treatments that vary initial endowments of spouses, final allocation rules and information in a voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM). Efficiency is decisively rejected in all treatments. Information improves efficiency only in some treatments, suggesting that the role of information is context dependent. Husbands expectations of their wives contributions are higher than their wives actual contributions, and wives expectations of their husbands contributions are lower than their husbands actual contributions. These systematic errors in expected and actual behaviour imply that the attainment of equilibrium as in a game theoretic framework is unlikely. Statistical tests indicate that instead of efficiency, other considerations are likely important. Overall, most of the empirical results cast doubt on models of the household that assume Pareto efficiency.","[Kebede, Bereket; Verschoor, Arjan] Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Kebede, Bereket; Verschoor, Arjan] Univ E Anglia, CBESS, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Tarazona, Marcela] Oxford Policy Management, Oxford, England; [Munro, Alistair] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Kebede, B (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",b.kebede@uea.ac.uk,"Munro, Alistair/A-3714-2009; Kebede, Bereket/AAJ-9484-2020","Munro, Alistair/0000-0003-3918-8701; Kebede, Bereket/0000-0003-4163-6614; Verschoor, Arjan/0000-0002-7770-6832",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101002] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,59,33,34,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This article points to the importance of human capital (broadly defined) and the quality of the British labor force on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. It shows that in terms of both physical quality and mechanical skills, British workers around 1750 were at a much higher level than their continental counterparts. As a result, new inventions-no matter where they originated-were adopted earlier, faster, and on a larger scale in Britain than elsewhere. The gap in labor quality is consistent with the higher wages paid in eighteenth-century Britain. The causes for the higher labor quality are explored and found to be associated with a higher level of nutrition and better institutions, especially England's Poor Law and the superior functioning of its apprenticeship system.","[Kelly, Morgan; Grada, Cormac O.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Dept Hist, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University College Dublin; Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Kelly, M (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 4, Ireland.",j-mokyr@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,125,60,64,2,20,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4606-5,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Option pricing models based on heavy-tailed distributions with three parameters overcome some well-known drawbacks of the Black-Scholes model when the realized underlying asset returns are not normally distributed. Both GEV-based and GLO-based option pricing formulas extract the implied volatilities successfully, indicating that they are compatible with the Black-Scholes formulas. However, GEV-based pricing model shows more unexpected patterns when extracting the implied tail indexes for put options than GLO-based pricing model including the credit crisis in 2008, implying that GEV-based pricing model is less capable of measuring the market sentiment during the extreme crisis events.","[Kim, Joocheol; Kim, Hyun-Oh] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",Joocheol@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Joocheol/A-9603-2015",,,,,,11,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The recent trend of aggregate economic activity in this area illustrates the risk that an economy leaves its stability corridor, in which it usually progresses in a cyclical way, to enter an area of turbulence. In this area, the automatic stabilizers have weak feedback forces. To examine this kind of situation in a theoretical framework, this paper presents a model that relies both on Leijonhufvud's corridor and on Harrod's instability principle. This model allows a threshold to be defined beyond which the economy runs the risk of entering a cumulative process of simultaneous declines in growth and employment. However, the existence of such a process requires unemployment to have a sufficiently direct effect on the growth in aggregate demand, as seems to be the case nowadays.","Paris II Pantheon Assas Univ Paris, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Le Page, JM (通讯作者)，Paris II Pantheon Assas Univ Paris, Paris, France.",jean.lepage@wanadoo.fr,,"Le Page, Jean-Marie/0009-0006-2003-0188",,,,,23,1,1,1,6,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Unlike much previous research, which has used only laboratory experiments, we find that the campaign letter focusing on one identifiable victim did not result in significantly larger donations than the campaign letter focusing on the statistical victim. In addition to the role of the identifiable victim, we investigate the degree to which each of our campaign letters affected donors' payments to other concurrent and future campaigns and whether there is decreasing marginal returns to campaigning in the sense that receiving a letter crowds out donors' payments to other future and concurrent campaigns. We find some evidence of crowding out, indicating that charitable giving could be a zero-sum game; however, the treatment letters did not have different effects on other payments.","[Lesner, Tine Hjerno; Rasmussen, Ole Dahl] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Lesner, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",ti@sam.sdu.dk,,,,,,,26,19,23,5,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We elucidate two channels through which debt affects international shock transmission. First, changes in domestic output cause fluctuations in the debt-to-GDP ratio and thus affect the risk premium on foreign borrowing. Second, fluctuations in the real exchange rate alter the real value of existing liabilities, generating wealth effects for the consumers in the indebted economy. Together, these two channels help to address the Backus-Smith puzzle by producing a negative consumption-real exchange rate correlation in an environment driven by productivity shocks.

We use non-random sorting into inter-ethnic marriage and salient differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazi surnames to evaluate the causal impact of Sephardic affiliation on wages. Using the 1995 Israeli Census, we estimate the effect of a Sephardic sounding surname on wages. We first compare the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to Sephardic fathers and Ashkenazi mothers (SA), who are more likely to carry a Sephardic surname, with the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to Ashkenazi fathers and Sephardic mothers (AS). We find that Israeli labour markets discriminate based on perceived ethnicity: SA workers earn significantly less than their AS counterparts. We then exploit the custom of women to adopt their husbands' surnames to disentangle actual ethnicity from the ethnicity perceived by the market. Consistent with ethnic discrimination based on surnames, we find that it is father-in-law's ethnicity-rather than father's ethnicity-that shapes female wage rates. Finally, we find that labour markets discriminate based on surname only when those names provide additional information about ethnicity. When ethnicity can be discerned from skin tone, surnames do not provide additional explanatory power with respect to wages.","[Rubinstein, Yona] Ctr Econ Performance, London Sch Econ, London, England; [Rubinstein, Yona] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Brenner, Dror] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Brenner, Dror] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ben Gurion University; Brown University,"Rubinstein, Y (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Performance, London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,68,37,40,4,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This overestimation may be perceived as beneficial because it increases the incentives to have protected sexual relationships. However, a fatalistic reaction may counterbalance this positive effect. Combined with the overestimation of the transmission rate, an occasional unprotected sexual encounter may induce the feeling that the die is cast, and hence lead to a permanent neglect of condom use. This paper proposes a theoretical model to predict this fatalistic reaction in both regular and casual relationships. Simulations of the model show that the expected transmission rate that would maximise condom use in high-risk populations lies between 0.55 and 8%.","Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Sterck, O (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",olivier.sterck@uclouvain.be,,"Sterck, Olivier/0000-0003-3835-9388",,,,,63,8,9,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Several theories have been advanced to explain this change. This paper focuses on the role played by changes that took place in the architecture of the income taxes. The changes were promoted by theoretical arguments and empirical studies, presented by some leading economists, that argued that lower income taxes, especially on individuals at the top of the income distribution, would generate significant beneficial results.

A popular modeling tool for the representation of complexity in economics and organizational sciences is the NK model that represents the complexity stemming from the interactions among the elements of a system. This paper proposes an enhanced model for complexity that, though maintaining the core design (and properties) of the NK model, provides a more intuitive and richer representation of complexity, extending its applications and deepening the understanding of its effects on economic systems. The proposed pseudo-NK (pNK) model is defined on real-valued variables, as opposed to the binary variables required by NK, so as to allow for richer and more intuitive definitions of distance and search strategies. It also admits as a source of complexity not only the number of interactions, as in NK, but also their intensity, opening a novel way to express and measure the level of complexity. Finally, instead of relying on statistical properties of a large dataset of random values, pNK is defined as a deterministic function, far simpler to implement, to interpret and to calibrate for specific requirements. The paper replicates known results and presents original ones; in both cases, the proposed model proves a powerful tool for the investigation of the role of complexity, particularly in agent-based models.","[Valente, Marco] Univ Aquila, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Valente, Marco] LEM, Pisa, Italy",University of L'Aquila,"Valente, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aquila, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",marco.valente@univaq.it,"Valente, Marco/G-8781-2012","Valente, Marco/0000-0001-5378-4898",,,,,30,8,12,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Although progress has been made by ratification of international and regional conventions and commitments by African countries, gender inequality is still prevalent in all sectors of the economy, including the labour market. The majority of women are working in the informal sector or on small pieces of land and are engaged in care work, where the work is invisible and unpaid. Womens labour force participation rates are lower than those for men. More men than women work in the formal sector where the work is paid and supported by all the national policies. Women contribute immensely to the countrys economy. Despite their contribution, gender inequality still prevails. Women have limited access to credit, land, agricultural inputs, equipment and extension services, and markets for their produce. They spend more time in care and domestic work than men. Some of the inequities are embedded in the deep-rooted cultural norms and beliefs in the societies.

The generic drug market has typically been viewed at the wholesale level as a competitive market with price approaching marginal costs. However, the large presence of third party payers as final purchasers may distort prices at the retail level relative to what a standard model of price competition would predict. In this paper, we investigate how generic drug producers compete in the presence of the procurement rules of the Medicaid program. Medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies, like that of other payers, is based on a benchmark price called the average wholesale price (AWP). The AWP is reported by generic producers themselves, and until recently has been subject to essentially no independent verification. As a result, generic producers have had an incentive to compete for pharmacy market share by reporting AWPs that exceed actual average wholesale prices, as this spread leads to larger pharmacy profits. In 2000, after a federal government audit of actual wholesale prices of generic products, states were advised to reduce Medicaid reimbursement by as much as 95% for about 400 generic and off-patent drug products. We use variation induced by the timing of this policy along with its differential impact on drug products' Medicaid reimbursement to estimate the impact of this exogenous price change on the market share of targeted products. Our findings indicate that pharmacies did respond to the perverse incentives of the Medicaid program by dispensing products with the highest AWPs. Overall, the Medicaid market share fell by about 45% for targeted drug products as a result of the policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An Agent-Based Computational Model,ECONOMIA POLITICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"While it has been well acknowledged by economists for a long time that competition is not just about price, the conventional quantity-based economic models have had difficulties integrating price competition and quality competition into a coherent framework. In this paper, motivated by Herbert Simon's view of near decomposability or modularity, we propose a quality-based economic model called the modular economy. In this modular economy, quality is manifested by the evolutionary design of more sophisticated and customized products that can satisfy consumers' satisfaction to a higher degree. Two essential features of the modular economy are founded through the agent-based simulation of a duopolistic competition. First, market competition tends to be self-annihilating; the competition will eventually end up with a dominant or a monopoly firm (conglomerate). Second, the high-markup firm has a better chance to be the only survivor than its low-markup competitor. We analyze these features through the complex cyclical dynamics of prices, profits, dividends, investment, working capital, and quality.","[Chie, Bin-Tzong] Tamkang Univ Tamshui, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan; [Chen, Shu-Heng] Natl Chengchi Univ Taipei, Dept Econ, Ai Econ Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan",Tamkang University; National Chengchi University,"Chie, BT (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ Tamshui, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei City, Taiwan.",chie@mail.tku.edu.tw; chen.shuheng@gmail.com,,"Chen, Shu-Heng/0000-0003-4584-7646",,,,,14,9,9,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The literature is divided into different analyses on the effects of the new Italian economic planning. The first and more drastic argument is attributable to the idea of the failure of Negotiated Planning, coordinated since 1999 by the Department for Development Policies of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Rossi, 2005; De Blasio - Lotti, 2008; Accetturo - De Blasio, 2011). In response to specific additional investment flows addressed to the South of a significant amount, distances North-South were not reduced and especially the enormous effort of the new season of the decentralized territorial policies showed radical methodological limitations and results, with negligible effects on economic development and on employment of the involved areas. The second theory emphasizes instead the presence of positive signs in economic dynamics of the South in the last decade, while recognizing the need of some major revisions in content and practices of development policies (Viesti, 2005). However in the economic empirical literature there is a lacks of comprehensive assessment of the effects of Territorial Pacts concerning complete data on disbursements to firms, investments, performance of funded firms. The paper aims to fill this gap. The methodology used for the assessment is consolidated in literature of public policy evaluation, and in particular the implemented instruments are the difference-in-differences analysis and the matching analysis. Two reasons for caution in interpreting the results has to be pointed out: first, that the assessment of the effects of Territorial Pacts is much broader than the analysis of the performance of the beneficiaries and generally concerns the territorial development of eligible areas, the institutional learning and the capacity to cooperate, and secondly the impacts of incentives on firms also derive from anticipatory effects when incentives accelerate investment processes already programmed.","[Dallara, Antonio] Univ Cattolica Piacenza, Fac Econ & Giurisprudenza, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Dallara, Antonio] Univ Cattolica Piacenza, Lab Econ Locale, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Rizzi, Paolo] Univ Cattolica Piacenza, Fac Econ & Giurisprudenza, Lab Econ Locale, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Dallara, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Piacenza, Fac Econ & Giurisprudenza, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",antonio.dallara@unicatt.it; paolo.rizzi@unicatt.it,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We address this question by analyzing international co-movements of value added (VA) growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. The model contains a world factor, country-specific factors, sector-specific factors, and idiosyncratic components. We estimate the model using Bayesian methods for 30 disaggregated sectors in the G7 economies for the 1974-2004 period. Our findings show that, although there is a substantial role for sector-specific factors, fluctuations are dominated by country-factors. The world factor appears to play a minimal role because, when using aggregate data, the world factor captures both the factor common to all countries and industries and the factor common to the same industry across countries. We then examine how these factors evolved as globalization deepened over the past two decades. Our results suggest that business cycles at a disaggregate level have not become more synchronized internationally. This is mainly driven by a substantial fall in the volatility of world shocks during the globalization period, rather than a lower sensitivity of sectoral growth to world factors. Our results also reveal that world factors appear to be more important for industries with a higher level of international vertical integration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the fishery management problem is used as an example to explore the potential of robust optimal control, where the objective is to choose a harvesting rule that will work under a range of admissible specifications for the stock-recruitment equation.

Downside risk or loss below a certain level of return is a concern regardless of producer risk preferences and thus a suitable measure of risk to use. Downside risk was measured as the weighted summation of net farm income below the amount needed for unpaid labour during the previous 10 years. Cost and RE were estimated using traditional input and output measures, and then re-estimated including each farm's downside risk. Comparisons were made between the efficient farms with and without downside risk and the average for all farms. As expected, downside risk plays an important role in explaining farm inefficiency. Failure to account for downside risk overstates inefficiency and can lead to unrealistic expectations in potential efficiency improvements.","[Yeager, Elizabeth Anne; Langemeier, Michael R.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Yeager, EA (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",eayeager@purdue.edu,,"Yeager, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4286-2659",,,,,23,2,2,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While such lending benefits millions of borrowers, major lending institutions acknowledge its limited impact among the very poor and have shifted towards individual loans. This paper attempts to explain this trend by exploring the relationship between borrower wealth and the benefits from group lending when access to credit is limited by strategic default. In our model, individuals of heterogeneous wealth face a given investment opportunity so poor investors demand larger loans. We show that the largest loan offered as an individual contract cannot be supported as a group loan. Joint liability cannot therefore extend credit outreach in the absence of additional social sanctions within groups. We also find that the benefits from group loans are increasing in borrower wealth and that optimal group size depends on project characteristics. By allowing for multi-person groups and wealth heterogeneity in the population, the paper extends the standard framework to analyze joint liability and contributes to an understanding of the conditions under which microcredit can reduce poverty.

The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization (EEO) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis.

First, we attempt to determine the source of the disagreement in the literature on the substitutability between energy and capital and reach a conclusion regarding the substitutability between energy and capital. Dividing energy and capital into sub-inputs, we analyze their substitutability. The empirical results indicate that fuel tends to complement capital in most countries, whereas electricity and capital are substitutes. Thus, this study confirms that heterogeneity in energy sources is a primary component of the systematic variation in the substitutability between energy and capital. Second, we examine asymmetric substitutability between energy and capital by estimating the Morishima elasticity of substitution. The estimates of the Morishima elasticity of substitution demonstrate that the substitution of energy for capital has dominated the substitution of capital for energy. This asymmetric substitutability is natural from the producer perspective because capital costs are much greater than energy costs in most countries. These results imply that the adoption of energy-saving technologies has not been induced in response to increased energy prices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

If so, does this effect operate through reducing entry barriers or by increasing sales once the firm is operating in the market? This paper examines linkages between current export destinations and entry, sales and exit for new markets. We find that measures of exporting experience in geographically nearby markets increase the probability of entry into a market and reduce the probability of exit. However, these same measures have very limited effect on the firm's export sales in the market. The effect of related experience on sales tends to be negative for recently entered firms. We interpret this result in the context of the Melitz heterogeneous-firm model of trade by showing that lower fixed costs reduce the entry threshold, but this lower threshold has the effect of allowing lower-sales marginal firms to be present in the market.","Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Lawless, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",martina.lawless@centralbank.ie,,"Lawless, Martina/0000-0002-3484-8670",,,,,14,18,24,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We suggest that the former may give up inventorship in order to secure authorship, even when entitled to the both. Based on a sample of 680 patent-publication pairs (related sets of patents and publications) we show that, very frequently, one or more authors of a publication do not appear as inventors of a related patent.

The present paper applies a decomposition approach and uses China's rural household survey data to investigate the causes of this grain output gap. The paper first compares the grain output gap between poor and non-poor rural households, and then decomposes the gap into differences in yield and area sown. The results indicate that the gap in grain output mainly results from differences in the amount of inputs used in production. Differences in the number of labor days and the level of intermediate inputs account for 13.6 and 47.5 percent of the gap, respectively. Poor rural households are also less efficient in their use of intermediate inputs, which contributes to 13.2 percent of the gap. However, the efficiency of poor households' labor days reduces the gap by 7.2 percent, while agricultural physical capital, household head education and agricultural training have no substantial impact on the household grain output gap.","[Ma, Ling] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ling; Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoyun] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Xin, X (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",xbml@cau.edu.cn; liuxy@cau.edu.cn; xinxian@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,,,,,24,2,2,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV,2013,21.0,6,,,,,22,36,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12044.x,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,291TN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329853000002,0

This paper presents results from a field study linking individual decisions to acquire financial information to a normally unobservable characteristic: time preferences. We elicited time preferences using incentivized choice experiments for all individuals to whom a financial education program was offered. Our results show that individuals who choose to acquire personal financial information have substantially higher discount factors than individuals who do not.

We use the new stability gauge in nonlinear panel estimates to examine the post-Bretton Woods period, and we find that trilemma policy stability is linked to official holdings of foreign exchange reserves in low income countries. We also find that the combination of fixed exchange rates and financial market openness is the most stable arrangement within the trilemma; and middle-income countries have less stable trilemma arrangements than either low or high-income countries.

In both student- and school-level estimates, peer heterogeneity reduces students' achievements in the comprehensive system while it has a positive impact in the early-tracking one.

It develops an extension of the Romalis (2004) model which yields two testable predictions. According to the first, exports between similarly endowed countries (South-South and North-North) are more diversified than exports between differently endowed countries (South-North and North-South). The second implication is that, for given countries' production patterns, low bilateral trade costs lead to greater export diversification. These predictions find empirical support in a panel of 102 trade partners and 4998 HS-6 industries over the period 1995-2007. Results show that similarities between trading partners in physical capital, land and human capital endowments per worker are associated with more diversified bilateral exports. Exports are also more diversified when bilateral trade costs are relatively low. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The national target assumes trading of emissions allowances across provinces, resulting in the least-cost reductions nationwide. We find that the national target results in about 20% lower welfare loss in China relative to the provincial targets approach. Given that the regional distribution of impacts has been an important consideration in the target-setting process, we focus on the changes in provincial-level CO2 emissions intensity, CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and economic welfare. We observe significant heterogeneity across provinces in terms of the energy system response as well as the magnitude of welfare impacts. We further model the current policy of fixed end-use electricity prices in China and find that national welfare losses increase. Assumptions about capital mobility have a substantial impact on national welfare loss, while changing assumptions about the future availability of domestic natural gas resources does not have a large effect.

It is generally argued that exchange rate depreciation stimulates exports and curtails imports, while exchange rate appreciation harms exports and stimulates imports. At times favourable factors (such as currency depreciation), however, may not result into increased exports because exchange rate movements affect exports not only by means of its depreciation but also through its variability (risk). In this paper, the above prediction has been assessed by considering the co-existence of import content in production of exportables and dynamic productivity gains. Results show that in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan, the exchange rate volatility partially offset the positive effect of depreciation on exports, that is, volatility in exchange rate has resulted into a decrease in export price competitiveness despite currency depreciation and, hence, the country experienced a slow growth in manufactured exports.","[Zia, Uzma; Mahmood, Zafar] Pakistan Inst Dev Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan",Pakistan Institute of Development Economics,"Zia, U (通讯作者)，Pakistan Inst Dev Econ, Quaid E Azam Univ Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",uzmazia06@gmail.com,"zia, uzma/AAZ-8285-2020; Mahmood, Zafar/AAL-4858-2020","zia, uzma/0000-0003-3150-2380",,,,,28,4,5,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Focusing on returns to education, evidence is found on the existence of educational mismatch and on its contribution to determine wages, with women suffering greater wage penalties that are associated with educational mismatch. Furthermore, although the gender wage gap is lower for individuals with low educational levels, we find that the part of this gap due to differences in returns is greater in this group. On the contrary, the gender gap is greater among highly-educated workers, but in this case most of the wage differentials are due to differences in productive characteristics.

There is a regime that can be overthrown but only if enough citizens participate in an uprising.

This coordination game with endogenous information manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the article gives a complete analytic characterization of the equilibrium's comparative statics. Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to overthrow. In contrast, if the number of signals increases, so that both total signal precision and the regime's costs of manipulation rise together, then the regime is easier to overthrow unless there are strong economies of scale in information control.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Edmond, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,"Edmond, Chris/B-7028-2012","Edmond, Chris/0000-0002-4621-8406",,,,,39,187,241,4,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Yet they are not only excluded from the Kyoto agreement and all current carbon pricing schemes, but do not even pay fuel excises of the type standard for other transport activities. Moreover, each sector benefits from preferential tax treatment - failure to charge VAT on international aviation, and the application of tonnage tax regimes rather than the normal corporate tax in maritime. This paper considers the design of fuel charges in these sectors to address these distortions, and quantifies their impact on emissions, revenue and welfare - showing, amongst other things, that the gain from offsetting the pre-existing tax distortions may be as significant as those from reducing emissions. It shows, too, how compensation schemes can be designed to protect the poorest countries - a key ingredient in the politics of the issue, given the practical need for wide applicability of such charges. The real challenge is to amass the degree of international cooperation required (especially strong for maritime), failure of which to some degree explains their current under-taxation - and, unsurprisingly, to decide who gets the money. Technically, these charges should, if anything, be rather easy to implement.

In a global game setup, I demonstrate that even a small uncertainty about economic fundamentals can be magnified through the uncertainty about other firms' investment decisions, and can lead to coordination failure, which may be manifested as systemic bankruptcy. Moreover, my model reveals that systemic bankruptcy tends to arise when economic fundamentals are in the intermediate range where coordination matters. High financial leverage of firms greatly increases the severity of systemic bankruptcy. Optimistic beliefs of firms and lenders can alleviate coordination failure, but can also increase the severity of systemic bankruptcy once it happens. High financing costs of lenders worsen coordination failure and increase the severity of systemic bankruptcy by increasing firms' debt burden.","Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Li, M (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",mli03@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

At the same time, wage dispersion is growing continuously. This leads to the question of how is the growing use of performance pay schemes related to the increase in wage inequality? German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data for the years 1984-2009 confirm the large increase in the application of performance pay schemes. This in turn led to an upward shift of the wage distribution by about one log point. However, it did not contribute to the growth in wage inequality. Even though wage inequality grew within the group of employees who receive performance pay, it grew even more so within the group who do not. Still, the wage difference between both wage schemes remained flat over the distribution. The empirical analysis employs sequential decompositions in a quantile regression framework.","Univ Freiburg, Dept Appl Econometr, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Sommerfeld, K (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Appl Econometr, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",katrin.sommerfeld@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,44,6,6,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Suppose the players value the pies asymmetrically: one player values the existing pie more than the future one, while the other player has the opposite valuation. We show that players may consume only a fraction of the existing pie in the first period, and then consume the remainder of it, along with the second pie, at the date at which the second pie becomes available Thus, our model features a special form of bargaining delay, in which agreements take place in multiple stages. Such partial agreements arise when players are patient enough, when they expect the second pie to become available soon, and when the asymmetry in their valuations is large enough.

The design allows us to study and derive clean measures of different forms of counterproductive behaviour in a controlled but non-obtrusive manner. We ask participants to complete a specific task (identify euro coins) and to report their output. Participants can engage in various forms of counterproductive behaviour, none of them being offered to them explicitly. They can make mistakes in the identification task, lie in their report or even steal coins. We present an application of the design to study the effects of different pay schemes (competition, fixed pay and piece rate) on counterproductive behaviour. On average counterproductive behaviour amounts to 10 percent of the average productivity, almost all arising through mistakes and overreporting of output. We find essentially no evidence of theft. Moreover, we find that both productive and counterproductive behaviour are significantly higher under competition than under the two other pay schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Unemployment Persistence,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The persistence of U.S. unemployment has risen with each of the last three recessions, raising the specter that future U.S. recessions might look more like the Eurosclerosis experience of the 1980s than like the traditional V-shaped recoveries of the past. We revisit several explanations for this rising persistence, decomposing them into three possible sources: business cycle fluctuations, changing policy responses, and propagation mechanisms. First, we find that financial shocks do not systematically lead to more persistent unemployment than monetary policy shocks, casting doubt on the hypothesis that different drivers of business cycles are the primary explanation. Second, we find that changing monetary and fiscal policy responses account for approximately one-third of the rise in unemployment persistence. Third, after examining three propagation mechanisms we find that jointly they cannot account for any rising persistence of unemployment. The three propagation mechanisms we focus on declining labor mobility, changing age structures, and the decline in trust among Americans are consistent with four other cyclical patterns that have evolved since the early 1980s: a rising cyclicality in long-term unemployment, lower regional convergence after downturns, rising cyclicality in disability claims, and missing disinflation. We exploit regional variation in labor market outcomes across Western Europe and North America during 1970-91 to assess the predictive capacity of each propagation mechanism for unemployment persistence. In summary, two-thirds of the rise in unemployment persistence is unexplained.","[Coibion, Olivier] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gorodnichenko, Yuriy; Koustas, Dmitri] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Coibion, O (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,"Gorodnichenko, Yuriy/ABD-5366-2021",,,,,,5,11,12,0,15,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

The results indicate that for the Kazakh regions natural resources do indeed play an important role in forming convergence clubs. It is further shown that natural resource endowment rather than resource dependence determines initial conditions and thereby convergence clubs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We suggest that autonomy may be conducive to student achievement in well-developed systems but detrimental in low-performing systems. We construct a panel dataset from the four waves of international PISA tests spanning 2000-2009, comprising over one million students in 42 countries. Relying on panel estimation with country fixed effects, we estimate the effect of school autonomy from within-country changes in the average share of schools with autonomy over key elements of school operations. Our results suggest that autonomy affects student achievement negatively in developing and low-performing countries, but positively in developed and high-performing countries. These estimates are unaffected by a wide variety of robustness and specification tests, providing confidence in the need for nuanced application of reform ideas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of the paper is to shift the debate to a social justice alternative that can sustain and enhance the social safety nets by implementing a full employment program that is both financially affordable and economically productive. First, the paper critically assesses the laissez-faire approach to job creation and lays out the mechanics of the job guarantee (JG) program as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Next, the paper critiques the deficit hawks' and deficit doves' fiscal cliff debate and demonstrates how the JG program can be financed according to modern money theory (MMT). Finally, the paper presents the cost estimation of the JG program for the United States to demonstrate its financial affordability and its productive capabilities.

In contrast to static market entry games, this paper draws attention to the effects of market dynamics on resource dynamics et vice versa, because (1) we show that feedback processes are necessary for obtaining a better understanding of what drives the dynamics between the evolution of common-pool resources and the number of harvesters and more importantly, (2) this analysis provides an environment discussing sustainability in an appropriate inasmuch dynamic way. The paper makes the following points: based on a co-evolutionary model, which incorporates resource and market dynamics simultaneously, it is shown that an increasing number of harvesters does not necessarily imply a lower stock of the common-pool resource in the long run. Further it is shown that a tax-scheme establish an output-sharing solution for coping with the overuse of common-pool resources. This results is in contrast to the prevailing literature, which mainly discusses tax-schemes and out-sharing as substitutes rather than as complements for solving the commons-problem. This conclusion holds even if we additionally assume harvesting-cost-reducing technological progress. On the other side if policy interventions ceased, strong resource sustainability in the sense of resource conservation is not possible, given technological progress is a relevant issue.","Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Klarl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Dept Econ, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",torben.alexander.klarl@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,39,1,1,1,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In a framework that distinguishes different phases of the business cycle based on whether the current period's economic growth rate and inflation rate are above or below their normal values, this paper analyzes the interaction among macroeconomic policy, economic growth and inflation in China since the Lehman crisis, and the implications for these key prices. The path of China's economy indicates that stimulus measures taken by the government during the recession phase and tightening measures implemented during the overheating phase have helped minimize the fluctuation over the business cycle. Our analysis shows that Chinese authorities tend to rely more on adjusting the exchange rate than the interest rate to stabilize the economy. Comparing with conditions at the time of the post-Lehman recession, the current slow pace of economic growth in China may reflect not only weakening demand, but also a lower potential growth rate associated with the arrival of the Lewis turning point.","Nomura Inst Capital Markets Res, Tokyo, Japan",,"Kwan, CH (通讯作者)，Nomura Inst Capital Markets Res, Tokyo, Japan.",s-kan@nicmr.com,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP,2013,21.0,5,,,,,1,19,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2013.12036.x,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,222QI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000324745800001,0

In the model, demand by a group of households in the domestic country is constrained by the availability of collateral. This implies more procyclical debt capacity because constrained households can borrow against the increase in the value of their houses during an expansion. A higher degree of financial liberalization and development helps constrained households reach higher loan-to-value ratios, thus relaxing their borrowing constraints.

People, however, commonly use self-serving justifications in order to feel honest even as they behave dishonestly, indicating reduced moral firmness. We test variation in moral firmness by comparing a sample of religious and secular female students. Arguably, religious people's upbringing and ongoing exposure to moral admonitions promote a firm moral approach which should translate into firmer moral judgments in adulthood. Results of a moral judgment experiment supported this proposition: Religious students judged lies more harshly than secular students, and were less influenced by the availability of self-serving justifications. A moral behavior experiment provided support to the notion that moral firmness in judgment may translate to moral firmness in behavior: whereas modest amount of lying was found among the secular students, no evidence for lying was observed among the religious student. Overall, we provide strong evidence for firm moral judgment among female religious students, and weaker evidence for firm moral behavior.

The lack of data, however, often limits the possibilities of a detailed, quantitative analysis. In this paper, we use a new data set on physical and human capital in seven Central and East European countries for the period 1920-2006 to calculate their effect on economic growth. In addition, we analyze the effect of including the quality of education in human capital. This allows us to perform a growth accounting analysis with the several production factors for Central Europe between 1920 and the present.

We find that higher resource rents lead to more corruption and that the effect is significantly stronger in less democratic countries. Surprisingly, we also find that higher resource rents lead to fewer internal conflicts and that less democratic countries face not a higher, but a lower likelihood of conflicts following an increase in resource rents. We argue that these findings can be explained by the ability of the political elites in less democratic countries to more effectively quell the masses through redistribution of rents to the public. We support our argument by documenting that higher resource rents lead to more (less) government spending in less (more) democratic countries. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms through which resource rents affect corruption cannot be separated from political systems.","[Arezki, Rabah] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Arezki, Rabah] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Gylfason, Thorvaldur] Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",International Monetary Fund; Brookings Institution; University of Iceland,"Arezki, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",rarezki@imf.org,,,,,,,30,57,63,1,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In this paper, we use data on giving by alumni at an anonymous university to investigate end-of-life giving patterns. Our main finding is that taking into account the approach of death substantially changes the age-giving profile for the elderly-in one segment of the age distribution, the independent effect of an increase in age on giving actually changes from negative to positive. We examine how the decline in giving as death approaches varies with the length of time that a given condition is likely to bring about death, and the individual's age when he died. We find that for individuals who died from conditions that bring about death fairly quickly, there is little decline in giving as death approaches compared to those who died from other causes. Further, the decline in giving as death approaches is steeper for the elderly (for whom death is less likely to be a surprise) than for the relatively young. These findings suggest that our primary result, that failing to take into account the approach of death leads to biased inferences with respect to the age-giving profile, is not merely an artifact of some kind of nonlinearity in the relationship between age and giving.

We consider a simple market for a homogeneous good populated by buyers and sellers. The valuations of the buyers and the costs of the sellers are given exogenously. Agents are involved in consecutive trading sessions, which are organized as a continuous double auction with order book. Using Individual Evolutionary Learning agents submit price bids and offers, trying to learn the most profitable strategy by looking at their realized and counterfactual or foregone payoffs. We find that learning outcomes heavily depend on information treatments. Under full information about actions of others, agents' orders tend to be similar, while under limited information agents tend to submit their valuations/costs. This behavioral outcome results in higher price volatility for the latter treatment.

In order to do this, it is vital to bear in mind the fact that long-term economic growth is characterized by the interaction between the physical aspects of capital dynamics and the disease level in a developing country which lacks a financial market. The OLG model will be used in our analysis. Notice that the level of investment in health policies and disease management are one of the key variables of the model.

And, does this relationship vary with bank characteristics? Based on a common source of balance sheet data for the four largest economies of the eurozone over the period 1999-2011, we find that the effects of monetary policy on bank lending are significant and heterogeneous in Germany and Italy - which are characterized by a large number of banks - but are weaker and more homogeneous in Spain and France - whose banking industry has a higher degree of market concentration. In particular, monetary policy appears to exert larger effects on cooperative and savings banks with lower liquidity and lesser capital in Germany and savings banks with smaller size in Italy. Our results highlight that the transmission of monetary policy over bank lending in the eurozone is highly heterogeneous. From a policy perspective, the increased large number of cooperative and savings banks, which have had access during the last financial crisis to the refinancing operations of the European Central Bank, bodes well for the improvement of the monetary transmission mechanism. The analysis also suggests that competition policy measures aiming at reducing entry barrier might facilitate the transmission mechanism. Roberto A.

In contrast to many of the post-1989 Central and Eastern European (CEE) transition economies, as well as the troubled five GIPSI countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy), Slovakia has kept unit costs competitive, fostered a sound banking system, and managed its monetary and fiscal policy responsibly.

A theoretical model identifies the interplay between market entry barriers and the usefulness of the information disclosed through patenting for competitors as a crucial factor driving the extent of disclosure costs that a patenting firm faces. High costs of disclosure may outweigh the merits of patenting, leading innovators to rely on alternative protection strategies, such as secrecy.

Do workers at different ages face the same variance of idiosyncratic earnings shocks? This paper proposes a novel specification for residual earnings that allows for an age profile in the persistence and variance of labor income shocks. We show that the statistical model is identified, and we estimate it using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data. We find that shocks to earnings are only moderately persistent (around 0.75) for young workers. Persistence rises with age, up to unity, until midway through life. The variance of persistent shocks exhibits a U-shaped profile over the life cycle (with a minimum of 0.01 and a maximum of 0.05). These results suggest that the standard specification in the literature (with age-invariant persistence and variance) cannot capture the earnings dynamics of young workers. We also argue that a calibrated job turnover model can account for these nonflat profiles. The key idea is that workers sort into better jobs and settle down as they age; in turn, magnitudes of wage growth rates decline, thereby decreasing the variance of shocks. Furthermore, the decline in job mobility results in higher persistence. Finally, we investigate the implications of age profiles for consumption-savings behavior. The welfare cost of idiosyncratic risk implied by the age-dependent income process is up to 1.6 percent of lifetime consumption lower compared with its age-invariant counterpart. This difference is mostly due to a higher degree of consumption insurance for young workers, for whom persistence is moderate. These results suggest that age profiles of persistence and variances should be taken into account when calibrating life-cycle models.

We develop the distribution of endogenous economic freedom by decomposing effects of economic freedom on the level of income per capita in IV-2SLS estimation framework for a panel of 134 countries to identify the effect of institutions of economic freedom on the level of per capita income. Structural estimates indicate that improvements in the monetary, fiscal, and labor freedom exert the strongest direct effect on the level of economic freedom and indirect effect on the level of real income per capita. Our study demonstrates considerable differences between the original and endogenous distributional dynamics of economic freedom over time. In exploiting the non-parametric setting of endogenous economic freedom, we identify a recent emergence of twin-peak distribution across countries where developing nations have improved the level of economic freedom considerably compared to the initial year.

A direct implication of this framework is that bank equity will be priced as a down-and-out call option. Using this approach, we examine how bank interest margin, i.e., the spread between the loan rate and the deposit rate, is determined when a bank is regret-averse. Regret-averse preferences are characterized by a down-and-in call, which is specified as the difference between a standard call and a down-and-out call. The model demonstrates how anticipatory regret aversion and the default barrier jointly determine an optimal bank interest margin decision. We find that a bank interest margin with a low level of default barrier is negatively related to anticipatory regret aversion and to the default barrier. Regret aversion and default barriers make a bank less prudent and more prone to risk-taking, thereby adversely affecting the stability of the banking system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Systemic risk is often seen as a problem of size, operational complexity, interconnectivity and contagion. It is less often discussed in terms of the institutional framework of legal rules and principles within which financial intermediation takes place, and the organizational culture promoted by those structures. In this article we redress this deficit through an appraisal of Northern Rock, illustrating the consequences of its transformation from mutually owned building society to publicly held company on organisational culture. These changes had profound effects on the incentive structure of its owners and managers, as profit-maximisation and shareholder value became the driving force within the firm, as in much of the rest of the UK banking sector. Thus, in addition to grappling with risk and uncertainty-and taking care to distinguish between the two-current efforts to construct a new macro-prudential regulatory paradigm should recognise the importance of Frank Knight's third key conceptual category-profit. Furthermore, in seeking to understand systemic risk, it becomes necessary to delve into micro-legal concepts such as property, trust, and contract that govern different forms of business to discern whether or not some modes of financial association create a greater degree of systemic risk than others. This is especially so when one organizational model comes to dominate retail markets, as did the publicly held company in the UK banking sector at the turn of the twenty-first century.","[Bholat, David; Gray, Joanna] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Bholat, D (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",david.bholat@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,133,2,2,0,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 7,2013,7.0,,,,,,,,201327,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-27,0.0,,,36,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185KS,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321967200002,0

The standard human capital model predicts that, as a result of human capital obsolescence, mobility becomes more costly when workers become older. We measure and interpret how changing job opportunities across 96 occupations affect different age and skill groups. Older workers end up in shrinking occupations, in occupations with a lower share of high-skilled workers, in occupations facing a higher threat of offshoring tasks abroad, more focus on routine-intensive tasks and less rewarding job content. This process is not only observed for the oldest group of workers, but for workers aged 40 and above. Observing older workers in declining occupations is to a large extent a market outcome, but declining job opportunities in terms of less satisfying working conditions and job tasks and content could potentially raise incentives to retire early.","[Bosch, Nicole; ter Weel, Bas] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [ter Weel, Bas] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Maastricht University,"ter Weel, B (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",n.m.bosch@cpb.nl; b.ter.weel@cpb.nl,,,,,,,47,10,13,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2013,161.0,2,,,,,199,218,,10.1007/s10645-013-9202-8,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,144PH,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000318951400005,0

Even after a decade of regional trade liberalization, the integration of CEE and EU economies is two to three times weaker than intra-EU integration, revealing a large potential for East-West European trade.

Using Norwegian longitudinal income data, it is found, as in many studies, that inequality is lower when each individual's annual average income is used as welfare metric, compared with the use of a single-period accounting framework. However, this result does not necessarily hold when aversion to income fluctuations is introduced. Furthermore, when actual incomes are replaced by expected incomes (conditional on an initial period), using a model of income dynamics, higher values of inequality over longer periods are typically found, although comparisons depend on inequality and variability aversion parameters. The results are strongly influenced by the observed high degree of systematic regression toward the (geometric) mean, combined with a large extent of individual unexpected effects.","[Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Halvorsen, Elin; Thoresen, Thor O.] Stat Norway, N-0033 Oslo, Norway",Victoria University Wellington; Statistics Norway,"Halvorsen, E (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, POB 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",Elin.Halvorsen@ssb.no,,"Halvorsen, Elin/0000-0003-1752-9595",,,,,45,1,1,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

A number of high-profile and large-scale projects have been advanced. This paper sets out the evolution of these policy interventions and explains why government involvement is critical to their success. It documents the gradual return of the state, as part of a process of underpinning the investment costs, in the provision of credible contracts, and in closing the gap between public and private costs of capital. It suggests that rather than pursue infrastructure policy as a set of priority projects, greater use of regulated asset bases and attention to the time-inconsistency problem would better achieve the overarching objectives.","New Coll, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk,,,,,,,38,16,20,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The government is starting to overhaul institutions in order to obtain market-based macroeconomic policy tools, which will possibly eliminate a long-lasting fundamental cause of economic instability. One essential challenge is to design policies to encourage private capital, and to promote the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, which have already shown a high potential. At the same time, a regulatory framework and a well-functioning financial system, which are essential to encourage private capital with market discipline, must be developed.

The study tests the validity of Wagner's law by applying autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration technique using annual data over 1950-2010 period. In order to find out the possible impact of omitted variables, we first tested the standard bivariate versions of Wagner's law. In the next step by including a third variable - inflation ratio - the analysis extended on a trivariate system. The findings of each testing procedure indicate that omitted variables matter. Since, while there exists no long-run relationship between the variables in the first step of the testing procedure, a long-run correlation is found in the second step. The differences of this paper from the earlier studies testing the Law for Turkey are that, the causal link is examined within a trivariate framework and non-interest government expenditure is considered instead of total government expenditures.","[Oktayer, Asuman] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Oktayer, Nagihan] Istanbul Univ, Fac Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University; Istanbul University,"Oktayer, A (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",aoktayer@yildiz.edu.tr; noktayer@istanbul.edu.tr,"Oktayer, Nagihan/AAD-8998-2020; Oktayer Buzluca, Asuman/E-7447-2016","Oktayer Buzluca, Asuman/0000-0003-1426-8588",,,,,65,8,9,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Subjects make a series of three decisions of allocating an endowment of 10 between themselves and a passive recipient that is either a charity or the experimenters. When making these decision subjects are informed that one of them will be chosen randomly at the end to determine payoffs. After all decisions have been made and it has been revealed which decision will determine payoffs we offer subjects an opportunity to opt out from their initial decision and receive (sic)10 instead. We find that almost a quarter of subjects choose to opt out, while around one third opt out from a positive donation. The fact that a subject decides to revise a decision to give and chooses instead to keep the whole amount - an option that was available when she made the first decision and was not exercised - indicates that giving in the first instance was not motivated solely by altruism toward the recipient. We argue that opting out can be explained through a combination of a reduced benefit of self-signaling due to satiation, and an increase in the costs of giving at the opt out stage, as they are realized with certainty.

Although the turmoil since the mid-2008 originated elsewhere, the European dynamics may turn the Great Recession into a full-blown Great Depression. Within this dynamics, the faulty design of the single currency is a key element, together with the neomercantilist fracture dividing the core of Northern Europe and the periphery, mostly composed of Southern European countries. The paper gives a quick reminder of what the true nature of the global crisis is (Section 2). The neoliberal Great Moderation was a paradoxical kind of financial and privatised Keynesianism. The heart of the Anglo-Saxon model has been the overcoming of the stagnationist tendencies emerging from traumatised workers thanks to the transformation of manic savers into indebted consumers. I will then (Section 3) dissect the peculiarities of the neomercantilist export-led posture. The eventual establishment of the euro as the single currency was in stark discontinuity with the Maastricht Treaty originating from the Delors Commission (Section 4). The real puzzle is to understand how the euro actually came into being from such fragile foundations, and also why for many years it seemed a happy experiment. The institutional setting of the eurozone and the German self-defeating obsession for fiscal austerity decisively drove the area into a double-dip recession. A way out of the crisis (Section 5) requires not only monetary reforms and expansionary coordinated fiscal measures, but also a wholesale change of economic model. This latter must be built upon a new engine of demand and growth. A monetary finance of good deficits is called for realising a radicalised socialisation of the investment: a class and Keynesian new deal.","Univ Bergamo, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Bellofiore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Via Caniana 2, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy.",ric-cardo.bellofiore@unibg.it,,,,,,,27,28,29,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Local and global factors jointly predict returns. The global factor is closely linked to US bond risk premia and international business cycles. Movements in the global factor seem to drive risk premia and expected short-term interest rates in opposite directions. We consider an affine term-structure model in which risk premia are driven by one local and one global factor. Shocks to these factors account for only a small fraction of yield variance and the cross-section of yields conveys little information about the factors. Finally, correlations between international bond risk premia have increased over time, suggesting an increase in integration between markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium of a conflict game with side-payments predicts that with binding offers, proposers make and responders accept side-payments, generating settlements that strongly favor proposers. When side-payments are non-binding, proposers offer nothing and conflicts always arise. Laboratory experiments confirm that binding side-payments reduce conflicts. However, 30% of responders reject binding offers, and offers are more egalitarian than predicted. Surprisingly, non-binding side-payments also improve efficiency, although less than binding. With binding side-payments, 87% of efficiency gains come from avoided conflicts. However, with non-binding side-payments, only 39% of gains come from avoided conflicts and 61% from reduced conflict expenditures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We use as a benchmark the pre-commitment strategy widely used in the literature and assess the potential welfare gains from pre-commitment by comparing the time consistent strategy to the pre-commitment, time inconsistent, strategy. The gains from pre-commitment are simply considerable since, in some cases, at the 5 years horizon the yearly certainty equivalent of the pre-commitment strategy is 48% compared with 9% for the time consistent strategy. However, these welfare gains result from huge and unrealistic positions in the risky assets; in some cases, the pre-commitment strategy is more than 60 times the time consistent strategy. We thus looked for alternative time inconsistent strategies that improve relative to the time consistent strategy while still involving reasonable risky asset positions. To identify these strategies, we explore an original aspect of the time consistent mean variance strategy: the presence of intertemporal hedging in such a strategy reflects welfare degradation. Therefore, a natural candidate is the time consistent strategy without the intertemporal hedging component. The second component of the time consistent strategy is the traditional myopic component discounted. We show that this component could be seen as a standard myopic strategy which is marked to market and the discount factor acts as a tailing factor. This marked to market myopic (MMM) strategy is shown to yield reasonable risky assets positions and substantial welfare gains at long horizons relative to the time consistent strategy. We also show that it dominates the standard myopic strategy as well as the equally weighted strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

I show that demand elasticities are a crucial element in predicting which firms invest, in what location, and for what reason. High-productivity firms, who tend to sell goods at a low elasticity, invest for market access (tariff jumping). Middle productivity firms, who tend to sell at a higher elasticity, invest for productivity improvement. The relative value of trade costs dictates which incentive is larger.

Moreover investments in power generation are no longer centrally planned in deregulated power markets but rather decided on competitive grounds by individual power companies. This poses particular challenges when it comes to evaluating the benefits of increased interconnection capacities in large-scale systems like the European transmission system. Within this article an approach is presented which allows assessing the benefits of interconnector investments in the presence of stochastic power infeed and endogenous power plant investments. This model uses typical days and hours as well as recombining trees to represent both load and infeed fluctuations. An application is presented covering 30 European countries and simultaneously optimizing generation investments and dispatch as well as utilization of transmission lines. The model is used to evaluate the benefits of further line extensions between the European mainland and northern European countries.

This paper aims to analyse the empirical fulfilment of RIPH for 17 OECD countries by employing many recently developed unit root tests. Power of the tests is raised by taking different approaches, such as using cross-sectional information, accounting for non-linear adjustment towards the equilibrium and allowing for structural changes. The combined results of the tests using panel information show that broad evidence in favour of RIPH prevails for 13 of the 17 countries. By contrast, univariate tests fail to make widespread rejections of the unit-root hypothesis. Our evidence reveals a high degree of market integration for developed countries, and the effect of monetary policies as a stabilization tool might be limited at least in the long run.","[Tsong, Ching-Chuan] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan; [Lee, Cheng-Feng] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Tsong, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou 545, Taiwan.",tcc126@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,44,4,4,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Identification is obtained by using official school construction guidelines as an instrument for the presence of GSSs. In contrast, private school presence shows little or no relationship with girls' primary or boys' primary and secondary government schools. In support of a supply-channel, we then show that, villages which received a GSS have over twice as many educated women, and private school teachers' wages are 27% lower in these villages. In an environment with low female education and mobility, GSSs substantially increase the local supply of skilled women lowering wages locally and allowing the market to offer affordable education. These findings highlight the prominent role of women as teachers in facilitating educational access and resonate with similar historical evidence from developed economies. The students of today are the teachers of tomorrow.

These data are then merged with other information detailing the economic, political, and security posture of each organization during the same period so that we can examine the relationship between economic prosperity, security, terrorism, and piracy. The main conclusion is that terrorism is mostly unrelated to economic conditions, while piracy responds to both economic payoffs and military deterrents.","[Blomberg, S.

We discuss the main contributions of the first and second generations of exchange rate target zone models. In an attempt to reconcile the poor empirical performance of the Krugman model with the reality of exchange rate target zone regimes, this line of research integrates target zones with alternative underlying economic models, such as imperfect credibility, intra-marginal interventions and sticky price models. It was thus possible to understand the correlations observed between the exchange rate, its fundamentals determinants and the interest rate differential, and to explain the fact that the statistical distribution of the exchange rate is hump shaped rather than U shaped. This implies that the initial emphasis of target zone models on nonlinearities, honeymoon effect', smooth pasting' and marginal interventions has vanished. Exchange rate target zones are better described as similar to managed floating regimes with intra-marginal interventions, with some marginal interventions when the exchange rate reaches the edges of the floating band.",,,,,"Duarte, António Portugal/GOK-0204-2022","Duarte, António Portugal/0000-0002-5388-0051; Andrade, Joao/0000-0003-0999-2264; Duarte, Adelaide/0000-0002-6585-2744",,,,,92,15,16,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The heavy tail nature of the total assets distribution seems to be robust w.r.t. a boom-bust cycle of the economy as well as special characteristics of Icelandic firms, e.g. their relatively small size and private ownership. Another important finding is that the profit rates, or return on assets, of Icelandic firms follow a Laplace like distribution similar to US firms.

Democracy also assumes that individuals will participate in the affairs of their community, i.e. there will be civic engagement.

While these findings are in lines with much of the existing literature on civic engagement, this paper uses these findings to make a speculative argument that to the extent that those with higher incomes are more likely to be civically engaged, it can then be inferred that a wage policy, which would enhance individual autonomy, might also result in greater civic engagement.

We consider an infinite horizon economy in which agents are heterogeneous with respect to both initial wealth and labor skills. We start by providing a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of a Condorcet winner. We then characterize the most preferred tax sequence by the median agent. First, we show that marginal labor taxes depend directly on the absolute value of the distance between the median and the mean value of the skills' distribution. Second, we find that in contrast to the intuition stemming from standard representative agent economies, labor taxes are more volatile and counter-cyclical taxation (e.g., increasing taxes in recession) might be optimal depending on the correlation between inequality and TFP. To assess the quantitative relevance of these findings, we calibrate the model economy to six countries and find that counter-cyclical labor taxation is optimal for all but the US.

Implementing comprehensive bans can change smoking norms and therefore have indirect impacts that persist over time. The paper uses panel data from OECD countries in the period of 1990 and 2004. The results suggest that comprehensive smoking bans in public places have persistent impacts on cigarette demand. A comprehensive ban immediately decreases smoking by 4.6%.

Distinguishing between three modes of child time allocation, school attendance, work, and leisure, the paper shows how child labor productivity and the time costs of schooling contribute to the existence of a locally stable antischooling norm and how policy can exploit social dynamics and help a community to escape permanently from low attendance at school and child labor.","Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Strulik, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",holger.strulik@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,"Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,57,5,5,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Although it is the opposite of consumer ethnocentrism, to date, cosmopolitanism has been primarily perceived as the virtue of not seeing foreigners as a threat, not being hateful towards foreigners, and embracing cultural diversity. Based on this conceptualization, our main objective is to develop and test an alternative pilot scale for consumer cosmopolitanism. Fifteen scale items were developed as a result of a literature review and consultation with academic experts. A survey was administered to 484 people in Turkey. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the scale items were grouped in three factors. To measure the validity of this consumer cosmopolitanism scale, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated that second-order-factor-model was a more rational measurement configuration to determine consumer cosmopolitanism with three factors.","[Altintas, M.

The first is outward-oriented development based on exports of primary commodities, while the second relies on domestic industrialization from within. A consensus that both models failed to achieve sustainable development in Latin America opened space for rethinking development theory and policy at the beginning of twenty-first century. Nevertheless, the debate lacks the understanding that history is non-linear, which explains why peripheral countries are emulating core countries to promote development. This paper argues that the recurrent inadequacy of development theory is due in part to the dichotomy between history and economics that emerged with the Methodenstreit - a debate about what method was most adequate to undertake social analyses. Development theory presupposes historical specificity, its raison d'etre being the belief that underdeveloped economies function differently than their developed counterparts. A meaningful theory of development relies on a shift from abstractions based on human nature to historically grounded principles.","Univ Missouri Kansas City, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Bracarense, N (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri Kansas City, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",,,,,,,,68,3,5,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In our theoretical framework agents allocate investment between a low-return technology which can be operated with internal funds, and a high-return technology which requires external finance. Firms can reduce the cost of funding by disclosing part or all of their assets and pledging them as collateral. The disclosure decision, however, also involves higher tax payments and reduces tax evasion. We show that financial development (a reduction in the cost of external finance) can reduce tax evasion and the size of the underground economy. We test the main implications of the model using Italian microeconomic data that allow us to construct a micro-based index of the underground economy. In line with the model's predictions, we find that local financial development is associated with a smaller size of the underground economy, controlling for the potential endogeneity of financial development and other determinants of the underground economy.

These are the broadest or most general domains in which economic activities take place. This article defines a logic of action as a set of socially shared rules of thought and behavior (i.e., socially shared mental models and behavioral rules) that involve a domain of action, the metric used, and the objectives or obligations associated with the positions people occupy in this domain. The domain by itself does not suffice to characterize a logic, and it has to be combined with the other two aspects. The article further discusses the relation between logics of action and institutions, arguing that logics of action are institutions with specific characteristics. They are conceived in relation to very broad provisioning domains and, as such, they have a high degree of generality. The market, the family, and the civic logics may be called provisioning institutional logics, but important differences do exist between the proposed concept herein and some treatments of institutional logics.","Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dequech, D (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,"Dequech, David/D-2312-2012","Dequech, David/0000-0003-2507-6688",,,,,44,8,10,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Yet output grows persistently over long periods, occasionally reaching approximate full employment. We resolve this puzzle by invoking Harrod's instability results. Demand grows because it follows an explosive upward path that is ultimately limited by resource constraints.

Three modeling approaches; multinomial logit, latent class, and mixed logit models are applied to ticket purchase timing decisions and to three market segments. The analysis, based on internet booking data with limited individual variables, investigates heterogeneous characteristics of passenger behavior across railway markets that differ by the length of haul. The results quantify the importance of fare, advanced booking, departure time of day, and day of week in purchase timing decision. It shows that mixed logit model provides the best statistical fit for the long and medium distance markets, while the latent class model provides the best statistical fit for the short distance market. On the other hand, the latent class model is found to be superior to mixed logit model in term of prediction capability. Results also show that segmenting price sensitivity by booking period is more appropriate for this choice model application than segmenting by socioeconomic information. This research contributes to existing literature on revenue management by demonstrating that complex demand models successfully recover random heterogeneity when limited socio-demographic information is available. The results, coupled with an optimization algorithm, can be used by railway operators to support revenue management policies such as fare pricing or seat allocation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The economy has a finite nonrenewable resource, and the government planner can choose to over-extract natural resources relative to the efficient path by distorting the discount rate, but in so doing incurs political costs that depend on the presence of democracy. Government planners in non-democratic countries usually have more autonomy in policymaking than those in democratic countries; therefore, the political cost is lower for non-democratic countries. We show that the incentive for the planner to distort the extraction path is larger, the higher is the initial resource endowment. Consistent with empirical evidence, the distortion raises short-term consumption but lowers the long-term growth rate, and institutional differences create corner solutions that explain why some resource-abundant countries avoid the curse. These results are robust to the inclusion of autonomous technological change.","[Hu, Bin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Mckitrick, Ross] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Guelph,"Hu, B (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 Coll Rd South, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hubin1981@hotmail.com,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Non-stationarity invalidates many of the results obtained from standard techniques and, therefore, requires special treatment. Because oil prices play an important role in affecting economic variables, this paper examines the stationarity of real oil prices (Brent, Dubai, WTI and the World) over the period 1973:2-2011:2. Real oil prices are expressed in the currencies of seven Asian countries (Indonesia. Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) and in the U.S. dollar. While using linear unit root tests without structural breaks shows no evidence of stationarity, allowing for breaks shows very limited evidence of stationarity. We argue that these results are attributed to the presence of nonlinearities in the behavior of oil prices. Testing for nonlinearity shows significant evidence of nonlinearity in all the cases with evidence of exponential smooth transition autoregression (ESTAR) nonlinearity-type in most cases. Applying unit root tests that account for two types of nonlinearities (smooth transition and nonlinear deterministic trends) reveals evidence of stationarity in all the cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A key contribution is made to existing literature on the transmission mechanism of fiscal policy in African economies. To the best of our knowledge; no published study has empirically analyzed the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy in the context of an open, middle-income sub-Saharan African economy like South Africa using an integrated intertemporal model with such disaggregated production structure. The paper shows that an expansive fiscal policy would have a temporary impact on gross domestic product (GDP) but would translate into higher debt relative to GDP. Using increased taxation to finance the additional spending would lessen this impact but would also negatively affect macroeconomic variables. Increased investment spending would improve long-term GDP, under any financing scheme, and would decrease debt-to-GDP ratio as well as deficit-to-GDP ratio. This outcome is driven by the positive impact infrastructure has on total factor productivity. Sensitivity analysis shows that these conclusions are qualitatively similar for wide values of the elasticity of the total factor productivity to infrastructure. In fact, the conclusions hold even when comparing different financing schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Pollution control consists of the assignment of permits to firms; private agents also can abate pollution. In this setting, we prove that multiple equilibria exist. Due to the possible irreversibility of pollution, the economy can be dragged into both environmental and poverty traps. First, we show that choosing an emission quota at the lowest level beyond a critical threshold is a means to avoid these two types of traps. We also prove that when the agents do not engage in maintenance, a reduction of the quota leads to a reduction in pollution but also to slower capital accumulation. In contrast, when agents do engage in maintenance, a reduction of the quota provides a double dividend.","[Prieur, Fabien] Univ Montpellier I, LAMETA, F-34006 Montpellier, France; [Prieur, Fabien; Tidball, Mabel] INRA, F-34060 Montpellier, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE,"Prieur, F (通讯作者)，INRA, LAMETA, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",prieur@supagro.inra.fr,"Tidball, Mabel/GYD-3456-2022; PRIEUR, Fabien/AAT-9498-2020","Prieur, Fabien/0000-0002-6651-304X; Tidball, Mabel/0000-0002-5576-0977",,,,,14,6,7,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Using a new data set which exploits differences in the quality of colonial administration, it finds evidence that colonies with better paid colonial governors developed better institutions (and became wealthier) than colonies with lesser paid governors. Initially, the best paid governors were sent to colonies which generated the largest revenues but, since the governors' pay scale remained largely fixed for the next 40 years, the same colonies continued to receive the best governors. The data indicate that these early differences in colonial administration and not initial differences in revenue generating capacity had a long-run impact on economic development.

Yet measurement problems make the relationship between property rights and entrepreneurship an ambiguous issue. As an advancement on previous research in this paper we propose a new approach to the evaluation of the security of property rights based on direct measures that overcomes some limitations of previous studies. We apply this new metrics to a survey of manufacturing firms in Russia to identify the economic effects associated with the lack of property protection in a transition economy. Our analysis supports the view that there is a close relationship between institutions, property rights and economic growth. Our findings confirm that redistributive risks provide a depressing effect on investment and innovative activity of manufacturing enterprises and potentially result in a huge loss in efficiency and economic growth, which in other institutional settings could have been avoided.

Although simple, the model can reproduce a lot of the stylized facts of business cycles. The author argues that agent-based modeling is an adequate response to the recently expressed criticism of macroeconomic methodology because it allows for aggregate behavior that is more than simply a replication of microeconomic optimization decisions in equilibrium. At the same time it allows for absolutely consistent microfoundations, including the structure and properties of markets. Most importantly, it does not depend on equilibrium assumptions or fictitious auctioneers and does therefore not rule out coordination failures, instability and crisis by definition. A situation that is very close to a general equilibrium can instead be shown to result endogenously from non-rational micro interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We study a previously unexplored mechanism by which integration between two parties could mitigate the problem. Based on the social identity theory, we conjecture that group identity strengthens agents' altruistic preferences towards group members, and this helps mitigate the hold-up problem. We test this conjecture in a laboratory experiment. Our subjects were randomly divided into two teams and asked to wear their team uniform. Task 1 required them to answer questions about trivia, where the subjects had access to a chat program that enabled them to help their team members. For Task 2, the subjects played a hold-up game with either a member of their own team (representing integration) or a member of the other team (non-integration).

Using both cross-sectional and panel data analyses we find robust evidence that the specific nature of democratic institutions has important consequences for public policy. Proportional democracies and presidential democracies - compared to majoritarian and parliamentary democracies - give more public support to agriculture and less to food consumers. The magnitude of these constitutional effects are stronger for import-competitive sectors and staple food crops. The effects seem independent from the ideology orientation of governments.

I first give a formal account of the reputation mechanism in anonymous online markets and derive testable hypotheses. Based on the analysis of a large set of process data (N approximate to 176,000), I corroborate a statistically and economically significant seller reputation effect on the probability of sale and the selling price both in auctions and fixed price offers. Moreover, my analysis shows that sellers making fixed price offers invest in a good reputation to a similar extent as buyers pay for it in auctions. Finally, I obtain repeated observations on a considerable subset of the buyer population by including highest non-winning bids in the analysis and show that buyers trade off sellers' reputations and prices within the set of offered items they choose to bid on. My findings provide further evidence that reputation systems solve trust problems and reduce transaction costs in anonymous online markets by providing incentives for traders' cooperative behavior.

In fact, the first order deviations means small mistakes in consumption decisions made by the representative agent, such examples being the case of wrong timing of adjusting consumption according to the new information set, lagged responses or misunderstanding the information.

Secondly, we estimated directly for Romanian economy the CRRA parameter, using two measures for market return.

We then use this framework to analyze two issues of interest, political intervention and fragmentation. We find that politicization cannot improve efficiency if holdout is landowner-induced, and may even increase inefficiency if holdout is buyer-induced. Further, the extent of politicization depends on whether it involves voice for non-members or not. Turning to the effects of fragmentation, we find that while it increases holdout in the absence of politicization, in the presence of politicization this effect may, however, be reversed.

Entry and exit vary widely across the various modes of provision, which argues against treating broadband as a homogenous service in theoretical or empirical work. The highest entry rates also generally have the highest entrant shares. Entry rates display positive autocorrelation, and the same is true for exit. There is also positive correlation between the entry and exit rates at various leads and lags, suggesting that there are systematic differences among the broadband types in the height of entry and exit barriers.

Asymmetry of correlation is investigated pair-wise by applying the test of Yongmiao Hong, Jun Tu, and Guofu Zhou (2007). Whereas the test of Hong, Tu, and Zhou (2007) is static, the present paper provides also a dynamic version of the test and identifies time periods when the correlation of Eurozone sovereign bond yield dynamics became asymmetric. We identified seven pairs of sovereign bond markets for which the null hypothesis of symmetry in correlation of sovereign bond yield dynamics can be rejected. Calculating rolling-window exceedance correlation, we found that the time-varying upper-(i.e. for positive yield changes) and lower-tail correlations (i.e. for negative yield changes) for pair-wise observed sovereign bond markets normally follow each other closely, yet during some time periods (for most pair-wise observed countries, these periods are around the September 11 attack on the New York City WTC and around the start of the Greek debt crisis) the difference in correlation does increase. The results show that the upper- and lower-tail correlation was symmetric before the Eurozone debt crisis for most of the pair-wise observed sovereign bond markets but has become much less symmetric since then.","Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,14,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2013,60.0,6,,,,,775,789,,10.2298/PAN1306775D,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,281EF,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000329082100005,0

This paper applies a financial valuation approach to estimate the direction and the broad extent of recent international financial adjustments on China's international balance sheet. We estimate China's international balance sheet losses resulting from the valuation shifts over the period 20052010 and reveal that international currency shifts over the past decade have also generated a range of non-balance sheet financial and monetary adjustment pressures for China. This paper also evaluates how China's evolving international financial policy arrangements could better mitigate China's exposure to international financial adjustments.

If trade takes place via a strategic market game bilateral oligopoly can be thought of as two linked proportional-sharing contests: in one the sellers share the aggregate bid from the buyers in proportion to their supply and in the other the buyers share the aggregate supply in proportion to their bids. The analysis can be separated into two 'partial games'. First, fix the aggregate bid at B; in the first partial game the sellers contest this fixed prize in proportion to their supply and the aggregate supply in the equilibrium of this game is (X) over tilde (B). Next, fix the aggregate supply at X; in the second partial game the buyers contest this fixed prize in proportion to their bids and the aggregate bid in the equilibrium of this game is (B) over tilde (X). The analysis of these two partial games takes into account competition within each side of the market. Equilibrium in bilateral oligopoly must take into account competition between sellers and buyers and requires, for example, (B) over tilde((X) over tilde (B))= B. When all traders have Cobb-Douglas preferences (X) over tilde (B) does not depend on B and (B) over tilde (X) does not depend on X: whilst there is competition within each side of the market there is no strategic interdependence between the sides of the market. The Cobb-Douglas assumption provides a tractable framework in which to explore the features of fully strategic trade but it misses perhaps the most interesting feature of bilateral oligopoly, the implications of which are investigated.","Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Dickson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Sir William Duncan Bldg,130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",alex.dickson@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,4,DE BOECK UNIVERSITE,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

We analyse the 'symmetric' role of productivity and other major firm attributes to characterize companies that enter into and exit from foreign markets. High levels of productivity are documented to be characteristic of companies deciding to engage in exporting or foreign direct investment (FDI). However, there does not seem to be a significant correlation between productivity and divestment decisions. Moreover, companies with corporate shareholders are more likely to intensify their international engagement and to retain their cross-border activities. Finally, high levels of short-term and long-term debt tend to increase the likelihood of entry into a more intense international engagement. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Statements are found to have a much more pronounced impact on the volatility of asset prices than interest rate surprises. They influence primarily stock returns, intermediate and long-term yields, whereas short-term rates are driven both by statements and by interest rate surprises. We also find that the regime shift of May 1999 has improved the effectiveness of monetary policy, as reflected in an overall reduction in market volatility during the most recent regime. In addition, markets are equally well-prepared for the upcoming rate decision in both regimes, but the process of adjustment depends on whether a statement was issued in the old regime or not. When a statement is issued, price adjustments are very similar across both periods, whereas if no statement is issued then the rate of adjustment towards the new value is more gradual and occurs throughout the entire intermeeting period.","[Farka, Mira; Fleissig, Adrian R.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Farka, M (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Econ, 800 N State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",efarka@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on the gathered data, the authors analysed its relation to gross margin, capital intensity and sales growth rate. The results have shown that the inventory turnover ratio correlates positively with sales growth rate and gross margin, whereas its correlation to capital intensity is not statistically significant. Retailers' approach to business operations and decision making on delivery of orders, reflecting the decline in the average inventory level, feature as the fundamental reasons for establishing a positive correlation between inventory turnover ratio and sales growth rate. On the other hand, the reasons for the positive correlation between inventory turnover and gross margin can be found in the characteristics of the retail market in the Republic of Serbia regarding the concentration levels and market share of the leading retailers.

We demonstrate in a model that firms could be credit-constrained due to aggregate uncertainty because financial institutions face high borrowing costs during economic downturns. Since it enjoys relatively lower borrowing costs during recession, the federal government could offer insurance in the form of loan guarantees to ease borrowing constraints for small businesses. Furthermore, we show that a guarantee program with a fixed fee is associated with adverse selection, and leads to the over-lending problem. We also show that under certain conditions, a program with a net present value of zero could be socially beneficial. Then, the high cost of obtaining guarantees and thorough qualification requirements can be viewed as tools to mitigate this problem.","Univ Prince Edward Isl, Dept Econ, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada",University of Prince Edward Island,"Jia, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Prince Edward Isl, Dept Econ, 550 Univ Ave, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4P3, Canada.",georgejia@gmail.com,,"Jia, Ye/0000-0002-1394-062X",,,,,33,5,7,1,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We find that (i) (March) CPS data are characterized by a substantial amount of noise when it comes to identifying occupational and industry switches; (ii) March CPS data provide a poor measure of annual occupational mobility and, instead, most likely measure mobility over a much shorter period; (iii) (the changes in) the procedure to impute missing data have a dramatic effect on the interpretation of the CPS data in, e.g., the trend in occupational mobility. The most important shortcomings of the PSID are the facts that (i) occupational and industry affiliation data are available in most years at an annual frequency; (ii) the PSID's sample, by design, excludes immigrants arriving in the United States after 1968; (iii) the Retrospective Occupation Industry Files with reliable occupation and industry affiliation data are available only until 1980.","[Kambourov, Gueorgui] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada; [Manovskii, Iourii] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Toronto; University of Pennsylvania,"Kambourov, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",g.kambourov@utoronto.ca,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0922406] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,39,26,39,1,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We also show that the low-tax regime tends to increase newspaper differentiation. If the advertising market is relatively small, the newspapers might invest too little in journalism and be too differentiated from a social point of view.

However, these studies neglect critical relationships or dependencies among SWOT factors. In this study, I propose a quantitative SWOT that rests on fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) methodology, includes possible dependencies among SWOT factors and permits the elimination of decision-makers' uncertain and vague preferences. To this end, I chose the Taiwan biotech pharmaceutical industry as an illustrative example.

This paper is motivated by recent evidence that trade has greatly expanded on the extensive margin (aka fragmentation, vertical specialization, offshoring) by adding newly traded goods and services and that much of this new trade is in intermediates. I provide an extension of existing gains-from-trade results by allowing trade in an added set of final and/or intermediate goods. As seems generally understood, a sufficient condition for all countries to gain from liberalization is that the relative world prices of initially-traded goods don't change, but I don't think that this has been generalized to expanding the set of tradeables. Further, trade costs break the strict link between domestic and world prices in my approach and this results in interesting subtleties as initially-traded goods change their trade status following fragmentation. I illustrate these results by applying them to two recent and quite specific formulations of expansion at the extensive margin: Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and Markusen and Venables (2007).

Brazil is part of an important group of developing countries (BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China) and represents a potential laboratory experiment in which the effects of an adoption of inflation targeting after more than a decade can be evaluated. Not enough is known about the consequences of inflation targeting credibility on both monetary policy and monetary policy transmission channels in developing countries that adopted inflation targeting. Hence, the paper analyzes the effects of credibility on the conduct of monetary policy, and the transmission channels through which monetary policy affect the economy. The study found that inflation targeting has represented an important strategy for the achievement of a more stable macroeconomic environment, which has been of great importance to investments and employment creation. Besides, the study found the following novelties: inflation targeting credibility positively affects entrepreneurs' expectations, expectations of entrepreneurs affect investment decisions and employment creation and the expectations of entrepreneurs are affected by the traditional transmission channels.

India, where the sector now dominates economic activity, is no exception. The object of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of the services sector with reference to different economic characteristics. Analysing data from India, we find that it is a set of highly heterogeneous economic activities with respect to productivity-enhancing technology characteristics, barriers to entry for employment, factor use, linkages with other sectors and tradability in international markets. This is indicative of subsector-specific implications for economic growth, balance of payments, employment, the sustainability of services-led growth, poverty, inequality and the different explanations for the growing share of the services sector in total output. Importantly, these implications, which lend perspective to the findings of a growing literature on the subject, provide a stepping stone for advancing significant research questions, both in the context of India and elsewhere.","World Trade Org, Ctr William Rappard, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Nayyar, G (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Ctr William Rappard, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland.",gauravnayyar81@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,3,3,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Indeed, there is now a broad consensus that innovative capacities of companies to a great extent depend on their effectiveness in dealing with knowledge. Earlier research findings have already demonstrated that knowledge management (KM) practices contribute positively towards levels of innovative performance and that this input rises in accordance with organizational efforts to foster contexts favorable to KM. Our review of the literature identified three factors considered determinant to the success of a knowledge management strategy oriented to innovation: (1) enablers relating to a knowledge friendly organizational environment, (2) processes incorporating the appropriate KM tools and (3) innovation performance levels. Different analyses have been enforced to address the interrelationship between those three factors. However, very few research studies have adopted integrated models for the analysis of the interrelationships. Furthermore, a large majority of studies focus on the creation and sharing of knowledge, excluding the other knowledge cycle processes. There is a clear need to reach out to the other phases inherent to the KM cycle and integrate the findings into the overall variables making up KM. Leveraging KM practices to achieve innovation goals requires a deep understanding of the knowledge processes, what critical issues influence such implementation, and how all of these factors relate to each other. As a result, we posit that systems thinking provide a foundation that can facilitate such an integrative understanding and can enhance an effective KM practice. This study proposes a theoretical framework and outlines a series of research propositions that enables organizations to link knowledge enablers and practices with innovation performance. We argue that KM practices draw on the energy of the enablers and interact with them to generate new or significantly improved products. It seems to us that our framework developed the theoretical bases for understanding the specific relationships among the different core factors referred in the literature and therefore, it may be the starting point for further research aiming to understand how organizations can leverage KM for innovation.","[Nicolau Santos, Maria Joao; Wane, Raky Martins] Sch Econ & Management ISEG, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Santos, MJN (通讯作者)，Sch Econ & Management ISEG, Lisbon, Portugal.",mjsantos@iseg.utl.pt; rakywane@socius.iseg.utl.pt,,,,,,,35,1,2,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-909507-15-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2013,,,,,,,362,370,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359145000041,0

Data mining approaches are especially effective in helping us to extract insights into customer behaviour, habits, potential needs and desires, credit associated risks, fraudulent transactions and etc. However, the integration of data mining into business processes still requires a lot of coordination and manual adjustment.

The consumption of tourism services in contemporary society is considered to be a standard part of consumption in general. Tourists proceed from available information offered by particular destinations and essentially create their own travel and tourism products. Consumer behavior is most often followed according to how they react to what is offered. Tourism industry products and services are always implemented at a particular destination and these services are administered by a range of providers whose share is constantly changing In real terms and over time. Tourists buy these partial products and their consumption provides a feeling of satisfaction, which is further fulfilled by the synergetic effect resulting from their current consumption level. For tourists, distance from their residence complicates their familiarization with the tourism supply of a particular destination. Tourist information centers provide Important assistance for their decisions. They are involved in the development of tourism in localities and regions by communicating tourists' requirements to the providers of individual services. They are special-purpose facilities that provide objective and evidence-based information on destinations, tourism services, and the leisure and cultural supply in the area In which they operate. By utilizing the services of the tourist Information. centers, tourists can receive premiums in the form of discounts, and service providers are encouraged to specialize their offerings.

In line with the literature suggesting that inflation persistence may be affected by the monetary policy design and its institutional characteristics, we find that inflation persistence is positively related to the central bank's preference for model robustness. In effect, model uncertainty and robust decision making may be considered as a mechanism generating inflation persistence, for a given non-zero degree of autocorrelation in supply-side shocks. Further, the policy implication is that the central bank's monetary policy under model uncertainty renders, in terms of the sacrifice ratio, the output-cost of inflation stabilization more important.

Starting from a high cost of offshoring, a decrease in the cost of offshoring reduces unemployment first and then increases it. The non-monotonicity of unemployment in the cost of offshoring does not obtain if wages are determined by individual Nash bargaining instead of collective bargaining. The non-monotonic relationship between the cost of offshoring and unemployment is verified through a calibration exercise performed using parameters for Sweden. The calibration exercise predicts that a decrease in the cost of offshoring, starting from the present level, would reduce unemployment in Sweden. In a two country framework of offshoring (source country and host country) it is shown how changes in the labor market institutions in one country affect labor market outcomes in both countries.

The Fokker-Planck equation for the resulting drift-diffusion process implies that the stationary distribution is independent of the size of the shock so that a small-disturbance limiting distribution is well defined. We present explicit solutions for the statistical equilibrium for the cases of quasilinear and Gorman-aggregatable Cobb-Douglas economies, and illustrate the results in the context of a generic dividend-discount model to emphasize the distinction between insurable risk and unhedgeable uncertainty in this context. The statistical equilibrium of income or wealth for quasilinear economies is described by an exponential Gibbs distribution. The statistical equilibrium income and wealth distributions for Gorman-aggregatable Cobb-Douglas economies can take a wider variety of forms, including power-law and gamma distributions. The statistical equilibria calculated for these examples suggest a close relation to widely observed statistical distributional regularities in real-world economies.","[Smith, Eric; Good, Benjamin H.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Foley, Duncan K.] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Good, Benjamin H.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Phys, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",The Santa Fe Institute; The New School; Swarthmore College,"Smith, E (通讯作者)，Santa Fe Inst, 1399 Hyde Pk Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",desmith@santafe.edu; foleyd@newschool.edu,,,,,,,52,4,4,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In the first step, this paper briefly discusses the macroeconomic and fundamental background of the Eurozone turbulences. We argue that the roots of the crisis lie in the persistent imbalances within the Eurozone and the inflexibility of the common monetary policy that turned out to be inadequate for the dissimilar economies of the EMU. We also point at the mounting public debt, the high risks associated with the European banking sector, and the interdependence between the financial solidity of the banking system and government solvency across the Eurozone. However - contrary to many other commentaries - we consider the large public debt not as the primary reason for the crisis in Europe, but as an effect of the earlier lack of fiscal discipline and the result of external factors added on top. Later in this paper, attention is focused on behavioural aspects that might have contributed to the financial crisis and human inclinations that demonstrated themselves on that occasion. We discuss the extrapolation bias and problems with the time horizon of the decision makers, the underestimation of risk due to overconfidence and the difficulties with the probability estimation of extreme scenarios. We define the Euro heuristic, a phenomenon responsible for overseeing the risk disparity among various members of the EMU, and explain why bad news gets accepted relatively slowly. Herding, the activities of hedge funds, and the role of rating agencies are also deliberated upon. The behavioural approach to the recent European crisis and the application of psychological inclinations in this particular context, constitute the original contribution of this paper. The findings of the paper may help to avoid similar mistakes in the future, especially for prospective Eurozone members in years to come.","Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll World Econ, Dept Capital Markets, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Szyszka, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Coll World Econ, Dept Capital Markets, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Szyszka, Adam/AAF-6049-2019","Szyszka, Adam/0000-0003-3196-5967",,,,,36,2,2,0,20,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Practitioners and certain researchers often commit the common error of using the results from the logarithmic measure of the income gap to interpret the speed of convergence for the income gap in terms of levels. This mistake causes overstatements of the speed of convergence. These overstatements are more pronounced for developing countries than for developed countries. This note also implies that speeds of beta-convergence greater than the conventionally accepted rate of 2-3% are not implausible. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is a proportional hazard model that imposes a common rate of duration dependence. A wide class of nonproportional Weibull models may be estimated by making the shape parameter a linear function of observable regressors. The log-likelihood function for these models is well behaved. The conditions under which this generalization is useful are essentially the same conditions under which interaction terms are useful in classical regression. Since the nonproportional model nests the proportional model, a formal test for nonproportionality may be conducted by likelihood ratio test. Estimation and testing of nonproportional models is illustrated with data sets for housing sales, out-of-court settlements and oil field exploration. Finally, estimation of a proportional Weibull model after adding temporal interaction terms to the regressors that specify the scale parameter is shown to be a fundamental misspecification. The standard log-likelihood function fails to recognize the stochastic nature of temporal interaction terms and the resulting estimates often fall outside the parameter space of the Weibull.","Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Zuehlke, TW (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, 253A Bellamy, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",tzuehlke@fsu.edu,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Current theories explain this spike from workers' behavior. We present a theoretical model in which also the nature of the job matters. End-of-benefit spikes in job finding rates are related to optimizing behavior of unemployed workers who rationally assume that employers will accept delays in the starting date of a new job, especially if these jobs are permanent. This gives some workers an incentive to not immediately start working after they have found a job. Instead they wait until their benefits expire. We use a dataset on Slovenian unemployment spells to test this prediction and find supporting evidence.

This paper explores the sources and implications of this variation in Asian countries across the models participating in the Asian Modeling Exercise (AME). Because the models do not all have a common base year, each team was required to provide data for 2005 for comparison purposes. This paper compares the year 2005 information for different models, noting the degree of variation in important parameters, including population, GDP, primary energy, electricity, and CO2 emissions. It then explores the difference in these key parameters across different sources of base-year information. The analysis confirms that the sources provide different values for many key parameters. This variation across data sources and additional reasons why models might provide different base-year numbers, including differences in regional definitions, differences in model base year, and differences in GDP transformation methodologies, are then discussed in the context of the AME scenarios. Finally, the paper explores the implications of base-year variation on long-term model results.

The paper highlights how the ECB's non-standard measures are motivated differently from quantitative easing policies. As a complement to standard interest rate decisions, rather than a substitute, they aim at supporting their effective transmission to the economy rather than at delivering additional monetary stimulus directly. The flow-of-funds analysis proposes an interpretation of central banks' crisis response as reflecting their capacity to act as the oultimate sector' that can take on leverage when other sectors are under pressure to deleverage. It also provides examples for tracing the impact of non-standard measures across different sectors and markets.","[Cour-Thimann, Philippine; Winkler, Bernhard] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Cour-Thimann, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",philippine.cour-thimann@ecb.int; bernhard.winkler@ecb.int,,,,,,,38,45,50,3,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We study two voting procedures widely used in the literature. The Stackelberg (ST) procedure assumes that votes are taken one dimension at a time according to an exogenously specified sequence. The KramerShepsle (KS) procedure also assumes that votes are taken separately on each dimension, but not in a sequential way. A vector of policies is a KramerShepsle equilibrium if each component coincides with the majority choice on this dimension given the other components of the vector. We study the existence and uniqueness of the ST and KS equilibria, and we compare them, looking for example at the impact of the ordering of votes for ST and identifying circumstances under which ST and KS equilibria coincide. In the process, we state explicitly the assumptions on the utility function that are needed for these equilibria to be well-behaved. We especially stress the importance of single-crossing conditions, and we identify two variants of these assumptions: a marginal version that is imposed on all policy dimensions separately, and a joint version whose definition involves both policy dimensions.","[De Donder, Philippe] Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, CNRS, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Peluso, Eugenio] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [De Donder, Philippe; Le Breton, Michel] Toulouse Sch Econ, IDEI, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Verona; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"De Donder, P (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, GREMAQ, CNRS, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",philippe.dedonder@tse-fr.eu; michel.lebreton@tse-fr.eu; eugenio.peluso@univr.it,,"PELUSO, Eugenio/0000-0002-4914-5310",,,,,34,13,14,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The intent-to-treat estimates indicate an increase in high-level computer skills of 17% points, and the LATE estimates indicate a range of 19-23% points. The results are robust to estimation strategy, measurement of the dependent variable, and inclusion of different sets of controls.

At the same time, the reporting capability of such citizen monitoring schemes is known to be limited due to technical and organizational deficiencies. Recent enthusiasm for outside interventions that address these deficiencies in order to lower environmental harm and raise overall welfare therefore seems justified. A game-theoretic analysis of a monitoring and enforcement regime with citizen monitoring shows, however, that the effects of such interventions are likely to be subtle. A higher reporting capability of citizens involves substitution effects that have ambiguous effects on the regulator's monitoring and enforcement costs: Welfare can actually decline and environmental improvements will fall short of expectations.

Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) have been proposed as a response measure to address these issues. However, more cooperative response policies, such as linking carbon markets, can also reduce the burden of emission reduction in acting countries and help level carbon prices. This paper analyses the effects of BCAs and both direct and indirect linking on welfare, competitiveness and carbon leakage within a global recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Results illustrate that an uneven carbon pricing can indeed lead to substantial competitiveness and welfare losses for acting countries as well as to carbon leakage. Of the instruments investigated in this paper, BCAs appear to be the best measure to preserve the competitiveness of acting countries as they shift part of the burden of emission reductions to non-acting countries. While BCAs are effective for acting countries, they cause severe welfare and competitiveness losses for non-acting countries. As a result, BCAs are less effective than linking in reducing global welfare losses, as linking tends to be beneficial for both acting and non-acting countries. The advantages of BCAs diminish as the carbon market is extended to more emission sources or to a wider international participation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The economic impact of naturalizations in Germany,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Citizenship; Naturalization; Self-selection; Economic impact; Integration,EARNINGS; PANEL,"This paper analyses whether citizenship acquisition affects the labour market performance of immigrants in Germany. The study uses actual micro data from the employment sample of the Institute for Employment Research, which covers more than 80% of the entire labour force in Germany. The econometric analysis has been carried out using panel data techniques, which allow to disentangle the effects of self-selection and legal impact of citizenship acquisition. Estimates from a pooled OLS specification suggest the existence of a wage premium for naturalized immigrants of both genders. Fixed effects estimates for males show an increased wage growth in the years following naturalization, consistent with the argument that naturalization increases the labour market opportunities of immigrants. Results for female employees indicate that the wage premium of naturalized women is solely the result of a positive self-selection process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that the world's poor and near-poor will play a major role in driving medium-run growth in energy consumption. As the world economy expands and poor households' incomes rise, they are likely to get connected to the electricity grid, gain access to good roads, and purchase energy-using assets like appliances and vehicles for the first time. We argue that the current forecasts for energy demand in the developing world may be understated because they do not accurately capture growth in demand along the extensive margin, as low-income households buy their first durable appliances and vehicles. Within a country, the adoption of energy-using assets typically follows an S-shaped pattern: among the very poor, we see little increase in the number of households owning refrigerators, vehicles, air conditioners, and other assets as incomes go up; above a first threshold income level, we see rapid increases of ownership with income; and above a second threshold, increases in ownership level off. A large share of the world's population has yet to go through the first transition, suggesting there is likely to be a large increase in the demand for energy in the coming years.","[Wolfram, Catherine] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Energy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Wolfram, Catherine; Gertler, Paul] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Wolfram, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Energy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",wolfram@haas.berkeley.edu; orie_shelef@haas.berkeley.edu; gertler@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,46,192,233,3,37,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We use a Computable General Equilibrium approach applied to a newly developed social accounting matrix, simulating three liberalisation scenarios: (i) import liberalisation; (ii) export liberalisation; and (iii) import and export liberalisations implemented together under different exchange rate regimes. Outcomes reveal that industry reallocation following liberalisation does not respond to classical trade theory expectations about factor intensity and abundance. On the distributive side, liberalisation seems to increase the high-skilled/low-skilled gap and favour rich households relatively more. However, since under fixed exchange rate also the two poorest household groups increase their income levels, liberalisation may also expected to be beneficial for poverty alleviation.

We use a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model of Tanzania to evaluate different biofuels production options and estimate their impacts on growth and poverty. Our results indicate that maximizing the poverty-reducing effects of biofuels production in countries like Tanzania will require engaging and improving the productivity of smallholder farmers. Evidence shows that cassava-based ethanol production is more profitable than other feedstock options. Cassava also generates more pro-poor growth than sugarcane-based systems. However, if smallholder yields can be improved rather than expanding cultivated land, then both sugarcane and cassava out-grower schemes generate similar pro-poor outcomes. We conclude that, in so far as the public investments needed to establish a biofuels industry are consistent with other development needs, then producing biofuels will enhance economic development in countries like Tanzania.

The hypothesis that third parties do worse under term limits is tested using state gubernatorial elections.

There is a trade-off in these two types of transfers between short-term improvements in food security and longer term food security achieved through increased agricultural productivity. Using the doseresponse models of Hirano and Imbens (2004), we investigate the relative impact of PSNP transfers alone and joint transfers from the PSNP and OFSP/HABP on agricultural output, yields, fertiliser use and agricultural investment for farmers growing cereals in Ethiopia from 2006 to 2010. We find that access to the OFSP/HABP programme plus high levels of payments from the PSNP led to considerable improvements in the use of fertiliser and enhanced investments in agriculture likely to improve agricultural productivity among households receiving both programmes. We find mixed effects of participation in both programmes in terms of impacts on yields. We also find that high levels of participation in the PSNP programme alone had no effect on agricultural input use or productivity and limited impact on agricultural investments.

Using annual data of 82 countries between 1995 and 2008, the estimation results indicate that an increase in government size can lead to a decrease in corruption if the democracy level is sufficiently high and, in contrast, can lead to an increase in corruption if it is too low. As robustness checks, the estimations using a different index of corruption and a different proxy for government size are also conducted. The results reveal that our main findings are robust. Furthermore, to address endogeneity problems, we conduct the instrumental variables estimation and the system generalized method of moments estimation, the results of which also support our primary findings.

If workers are collectively organised, incentives for technology transfers are partly governed by firms' desire to curb trade union power. Higher union bargaining power in the North leads to more technology transfer along two different dimensions - skill upgrading of Southern workers and quality upgrading of products produced in the South - possibly to the extent that the utility of Northern workers decline. Policies to raise the wage levels of Southern workers might spur technology transfer if wages are initially very low, but have a dampening effect on North-South technology transfer once the Southern wage level has surpassed a certain threshold level.

Moreover, results from Granger causality tests show evidence in favor of Wagner's Law only for passive interests spending in the long-run, and for dependent labor income spending in the short-run. Some notes on the policy implications of our empirical results conclude the paper.

We use an endogenous job destruction framework in the style of Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) with directed search. We show that when growth accelerates, a larger share of unskilled workers seeks training, increasing firms' incentives to update job-specific technology (rather than destroying it). By magnifying the impact of growth on employment, the introduction of human capital issues allows the model to more closely match the estimated sensitivity of unemployment with respect to growth. When calibrated, the model manages to reproduce the aggregate capitalization effect estimated using OECD data. We find that growth reduces unemployment for individuals receiving training, while it increases the unemployment rate of unskilled workers without training (creative destruction effect).

For this purpose, we test the hypothesis that the recent evolution of the financial markets has affected the future oil market so as to increase its contribution to the price discovery process of the spot market. We modeled the relation between WTI spot and future prices as a cointegration relation. By using the Kalman filter technique, it was possible to obtain a time-varying measure of the contribution of future markets to the price discovery mechanism. The results show that in the case of WTI, the contribution of the futures market has been increasing, especially between 2003 and 2008 and then again after the start of 2009, evidencing the growing importance of factors particular to the financial markets in determining oil prices in recent years. During 2009, the spot prices adjusted to agents' future expectations rather than to the current supply and demand conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using survey data gathered from 175 Korean Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which have participated in ITFs under the Korean government's ITF assistance programs, the results show that: (1) a firm's internal resources have a direct impact on ITF participation activities and an indirect positive impact on ITF performance due to their effect on ITF participation activities; (2) the government's ITF assistance programs have a direct impact on ITF participation activities and performance, and an indirect impact on ITF performance due to their effect on ITF participation activities; and (3) ITF participation activities have a direct impact on ITF performance. This means that ITF participation activities act as a mediating variable with a total mediating effect when a firm's internal resources affect ITF performance. In addition, ITF participation activities act as a mediating variable with a partial mediating effect when the government's ITF assistance programs affect ITF performance. As a result, a firm's internal resources indirectly affect an exhibitor's successful performance, whereas government assistant programs both directly and indirectly affect the performance at ITFs.","[Kim, Bong-Seok; Freyer, Walter; Lee, Hey-Ryon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Convent Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Zhou, Yan] Beijing Union Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Freyer, Walter] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Transportat & Econ, Dresden, Germany",Kyung Hee University; Beijing Union University; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kim, BS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Convent Management, Seoul, South Korea.",yan.zhou@buu.edu.cn; herz5@khu.ac.kr; Freyer@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; leehr@kh-u.ac.kr,"Kim, Bong-Seok/AAH-9256-2020",,,,,,64,2,2,2,23,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The research involved data collection in the port of call of Messina (Sicily, Italy), during the peak cruise season in 2011. A mixed generalized ordered logit analysis, based upon a correspondence analysis, is run to examine what factors influence residents' perceptions about investing in cruise tourism. Potential positive and negative externalities produced by this economic activity, as well as socio-demographic and economic determinants are taken into account. Overall, residents in Messina, treated as a composite stakeholder, would invest a very high level of resources in cruising if their income depends on the cruise activity, if they had a cruise trip in the past, if they belong to a family with a high number of components, and if they believe this activity to exert positive welfare, cultural and social externalities. Conversely, residents in Messina are likely to prefer a low, or very low level of investment the farther they live from the port, if they are female, retired and if they perceive a deterioration of the environment. Implications for policy makers are drawn from these empirical findings.","[Brida, Juan Gabriel] Free Univ Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy; [Del Chiappa, Giacomo; Meleddu, Marta; Pulina, Manuela] Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Sassari,"Pulina, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Econ & Business DiSEA, Via Torre Tonda 34, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",mpulina@uniss.it,"Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015; Del Chiappa, Giacomo/AAG-4411-2020; Meleddu, Marta/HFZ-7852-2022","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790; Del Chiappa, Giacomo/0000-0003-4318-0462; Meleddu, Marta/0000-0003-3081-0584",,,,,39,2,2,1,38,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 30,2012,6.0,,,,,,,,201240,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-40,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,091GX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000315038500001,0

However, in the present study, multivariate analyses of Census data cast doubt on this assertion. They show that in large northern cities, measures of black participation in numerous entrepreneurial and professional occupations were positively and significantly associated with one another and were, in some cases, positively associated with measures of black participation in various public service, artistic, entertainment, and mass media occupations. There is evidence, then, for a revisionist view of black enterprise that suggests that important economic and social endeavors coexisted in beneficial relationships within the black communities of cities that were the principal destinations of black migrants from the South in the early twentieth century.

We extend previous studies by examining not only tariff changes in the liberalizing country but also trade reforms in the rest of the world. In addition, we look at whether these effects differ across industries depending on their degree of comparative advantage. The results show that a reduction in home tariffs decreases the number of establishments, firms average size, and markups. All of these three effects are found to be of lower magnitude for comparative advantage industries. In the case of foreign tariffs, our results show that a reduction in protection in the rest of the world is associated with an increase in the number of establishments (which is likely to be reflecting an increase in export profitability), a decrease in average size, while markups are mostly unaffected.

The paper adopts a modified two-stage gravity model to control for both sample selection bias and firm heterogeneity bias. It was found that a country's TBT notifications decrease other countries' probability of exporting, but increase their export volumes. The result can be explained by the TBT's differential effects on the fixed and variable cost of export, and consumer confidence. It was further found that (i) a developing country's TBT have significant effects on other developing countries' exports, but no significant effects on the developed countries' exports, (ii) a developed country's TBT have significant effects on the exports from both types of countries, and (iii) exports from developed countries are affected by a developed country's TBT more seriously than a developing country's TBT.","[Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bao, Xiaohua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Qiu, LD (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xiaohuabao77@163.com; larryqiu@hku.hk,,,,,,,26,45,49,12,77,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our experiment involves dyads (i.e. two-member groups) who have to compose consumption bundles consisting of three commodities (wine, orange juice and M&Ms). We focus on the collective consumption model to describe group behavior. This model represents group decisions as Pareto optimal outcomes of a within-group bargaining process, with rational group members who are each characterized by individual bargaining weights. We also consider specifications of the collective model that restrict the variation of these bargaining weights. A distinguishing feature of our study is that we use revealed preference testing tools to assess the goodness-of-fit and discriminatory power of alternative specifications of the collective model. Our experimental results suggest that the most appropriate model specification allows for a limited variation of the bargaining weights.","[Cherchye, Laurens] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; [Bruyneel, Sabrina] Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Cherchye, Laurens] Tilburg Univ, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [De Rock, Bram] Univ Libre Brussels, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [De Rock, Bram] Univ Libre Brussels, ECORE, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Tilburg University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Cherchye, L (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, E Sabbelaan 53, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium.",sabrina.bruyneel@econ.kuleuven.be; L.Cherchye@uvt.nl; bderock@ulb.ac.be,"Bruyneel, Sabrina/M-3149-2019","Bruyneel, Sabrina/0000-0002-3990-7975; Cherchye, Laurens/0000-0003-3766-2449; De Rock, Bram/0000-0002-5114-1386",,,,,49,7,8,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

This paper addresses this issue by comparing retail gasoline and diesel prices in order to see whether they rise faster than they fall given the price of their upstream input, crude oil. This phenomenon has been termed in the literature as Rockets and Feathers. We apply the threshold vector error correction model (TVECM) of Hansen and Seo (2002) which has not yet been applied in the literature. We account for the 2008 structural break to crude oil and petroleum prices by splitting the sample using evidence from the recent structural break unit root test of Kim and Perron (2009). Both markets seem to price symmetrically before the 2008 break, but we find evidence of asymmetric pricing after 2008 in diesel prices, and not in gasoline prices. Given that the diesel market is small relative to the gasoline market and therefore more open to price exploitation, the ongoing cost increases associated with the policy of switching to Ultra Low Sulphur diesel (ULSD) from 2006 to 2010 could be at the heart of this asymmetry. With this in mind, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission should monitor diesel prices as the market share grows, in order to ensure that consumers are not adversely affected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis suggests two conclusions: carbon pricing led to an increase in environmental efficiency and to a shift outwards of the technological frontier; and, the overly generous allocation of emission permits had a negative impact on both measures. These results are shown to be robust to changes in controls and specifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

EVIDENCE FROM KOREAN EXPORTS,SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Extensive margin; intensive margin; trade determinants; Korea,VARIETY; IMPACT; PROMOTION,"Recently, there has been increased interest in the distinction between the extensive margin (EM) and the intensive margin (IM) of international trade. Between 1988 and 2006, the growth of the EMs and IMs of Korean exports has been diverse across its destinations. This paper links each component of the trade value (EM, IM, price index and quantity index) to factors that have been identified as trade determinants in the suggested model. This paper finds that the destination GDP, distance, tariffs, language, existence of an export promotion agency (EPA), local infrastructure and import procedures have an effect on the EMs and IMs of Korea's exports, and the effect works largely through the IM. This paper examines the external environment that shapes the contributions of each of these margins of a country's exports.","Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Kyeongsan Si 712749, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea",Yeungnam University,"Kang, KC (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, 214-1 Dae Dong, Kyeongsan Si 712749, Gyeongsangbuk D, South Korea.",kikang@ynu.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Due to the impossibility of applying an ideal economic solution for internalisation of external costs, alternative solutions have to be developed and implemented. One of the possible solutions for internalisation of external costs of CO2 and pollutant emissions from passenger cars is presented in this paper. It is a new methodology for calculating annual circulation taxes on passenger cars. This methodology, besides CO2, also takes into account the pollutants whose emissions are regulated by the Euro standards (CO, HC, NOx and PM), as well as the vehicle age and kilometres driven. The proposed methodology has been tested on some of the best-selling passenger cars in Europe. The results of analysis show significant differences between our methodology and the methodologies that are used in five European countries (Ireland, the United Kingdom, Malta, Luxembourg and Sweden), which use the CO2 emissions as a reference value for their calculation. Also, we have proved that the annual circulation tax, calculated using our methodology, provide better internalisation of external costs compared to the fuel tax.","[Kaplanovic, Snezana; Mijailovic, Radomir] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Vojvode Stepe 305, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Kaplanovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Vojvode Stepe 305, Serbia.",s.kaplanovic@open.telekom.rs; radomirm@beotel.rs,,"Mijailovic, Radomir/0000-0001-9461-713X",,,,,45,9,9,0,31,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The central divide is whether positive transaction cost requires a major reworking of the core of neoclassical price theory (Coase: yes; Posner: no). Evidence is provided by examining the basic price theory tools (demand curve, demand/supply model) that Posner uses in Chapter 1 of his treatise Economic Analysis of Law and their application in Chapter 11 to labor and employment law. It is demonstrated that these tools and derivative conclusions about labor law are not robust with respect to variation in transaction cost and the institutional structure of production. Hence, standard price theory is subject to irreducible indeterminacy and the welfare effects of labor and employment law can only be decided on empirical grounds, thus supporting the position of Coase and original institutionalists over Posner.","[Kaufman, Bruce E.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Kaufman, Bruce E.] Griffith Univ, Ctr Work Org & Wellbeing, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kaufman, Bruce E.] Griffith Univ, Dept Human Resources & Employment Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Kaufman, Bruce E.] Univ Hertsfordshire, Sch Business, Work & Employment Res Unit, Hatfield, Herts, England",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Griffith University; Griffith University; University of Hertfordshire,"Kaufman, BE (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,,,,,70,4,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The finding show that this policy shift has disconnected Russian interest rates from US dollar-denominated interest rates, while instead linking them to a synthetic interest rate composed of USD and EUR rates at the same proportion as that of these two currencies in the currency basket against which the ruble's exchange rate is set. The Russian experience shows that while the adoption of bi-currency targeting may help ensure that domestic interest rates are less dependent on the monetary cycle of a single country, these rates are instead likely to reflect financial developments in all countries whose currencies are included in the currency basket. This insight is likely to be relevant for other countries that pursue basket-targeting policies.","Higher Sch Econ, Int Coll Econ & Finance, Moscow 109028, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Sokolov, V (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Int Coll Econ & Finance, 11 Pokrovsky Bulv, Moscow 109028, Russia.",vsokolov@hse.ru,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Morality is defined as an aversion to consuming goods obtained through appropriative rather than productive activities. In our empirical analysis we adapt the well-known regression framework of Rodrik et al. (2004), using the World Values Survey as a source of proxies for morality. Using our preferred proxy, we find evidence that higher within-country correlation between morality and ability, holding constant the levels of morality and ability, increases per-capita income levels. Under our preferred specification, a one-standard-deviation increase in the correlation between morality and ability raises the log of per-capita income by about one-fourth of a standard deviation, equal to approximately $3600 for the median income country in our sample. Results are robust to correcting for endogeneity and to changes in sample and specification. Results are mixed when we use alternative morality proxies, but the coefficient on the morality-ability correlation is still usually positive and statistically significant. We also develop a simple static general equilibrium model to serve as a possible framework for understanding the empirical results. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (3) (2012) 457-475.

We present results from a randomized field experiment in which low-income individuals receiving tax preparation help were also offered immediate assistance and a streamlined process to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for themselves or their children. Treated participants were also provided with aid estimates that were compared against tuition cost amounts for nearby colleges. The combined assistance and information treatment substantially increased FAFSA submissions and ultimately the likelihood of college attendance, persistence, and aid receipt. In particular, high school seniors whose parents received the treatment were 8 percentage points more likely to have completed two years of college, going from 28% to 36%, during the first three years following the experiment. Families who received aid information but no assistance with the FAFSA did not experience improved outcomes. The findings suggest many other opportunities for using personal assistance to increase participation in programs that require filling out forms to become eligible.

These findings reveal that information-processing heuristics matter even in markets with large stakes and easily observed information.

We identify trade freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption as the most important indicators of economic freedom for growth in transition countries over the period 19942007.

The loan rate depends on the repayment probability, which in turn depends on firms' net worth and cyclical output. The supply of bank loans is perfectly elastic at the prevailing loan rate and so is the provision of central bank liquidity at the policy rate. Numerical simulations, based on an illustrative calibration, show that credit market imperfections and sluggish adjustment of bank deposit rates may impart a substantial degree of persistence in the response of output and inflation to monetary shocks. With flexible wages, a relatively high elasticity of the repayment probability with respect to cyclical output is required for a monetary contraction to lead to higher inflation, that is, to a price puzzle.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Alper, Koray] Cent Bank Turkey, Res Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Manchester; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",pierre-richard.agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,9,11,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

A time series quarterly data from the period of 1999 to 2008 was used. The effects of FDI inflows on human capital, labour force, absorptive capacity and physical capital were investigated. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was applied to estimate the data in the first step and in the second step productivity indicators were calculated. The results show that the FDI inflows and inputs used are negatively contributed to total factor productivity (TFP). Meanwhile, FDI plays a significant role in achieving economic growth through input driven as indicated by the contribution of the TFP. In this regard, a significant positive relationship between human capital, labour force and absorptive capacity which determines the spillover effect on Malaysian economic growth (GDP) was found and the physical capital has shown negative relationship.

We compute the equilibrium manifold for a Bertrand pricing game in which the number of equilibria changes with the market size. Moreover, we apply these techniques to two stochastic dynamic games of industry competition and check for equilibrium uniqueness.","[Judd, Kenneth L.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Renner, Philipp] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmedders, Karl] DBA Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Stanford University; University of Zurich,"Judd, KL (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kennethjudd@mac.com; philipp.renner@business.uzh.ch; karl.schmedders@business.uzh.ch,,"Renner, Philipp/0000-0003-1102-1029",,,,,43,9,11,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

I also show that none of the proposed falsification tests works well when the achievement production function is misspecified. Finally, I return to the same North Carolina sample employed by Rothstein and retest the assumption of conditional random assignment.

This paper analyzes the role of social influence in determining such distinct collective outcomes. Agents are assumed to acquire information from others through a certain sampling process, that generates an influence network, and they use simple rules to decide whether to adopt or not depending on the behavior of the observed sample. We characterize, as a function of the primitives of the model, the diffusion threshold (i.e., the spreading rate above which the adoption of the new behavior becomes persistent in the population) and the endemic state (i.e., the fraction of adopters in the stationary state of the dynamics). We find that an increase in the correlation between the out-degree (information level) and in-degree (visibility level) of agents may favor or harm diffusion; the effect actually depends on the specific details of the adoption process.

Cox proportional hazard, Weibull and exponential models are used to examine the effects of various factors on export duration. It is revealed that export duration tends to be rather short-lived. It is also found that GDP and GDP per capita of the export destination have positive effects on export duration, while trade relationships with distant and landlocked countries are generally of shorter duration. In addition, export duration is longer for differentiated and parts and components products, as well as products with large initial trade values. WTO membership is also important for longer export duration. Our empirical analysis suggests that developed markets, such as the USA and the EU, are important to China, and should still be the major sources for Chinese export growth in the long run. Moreover, technical innovation of firms and free trade agreement negotiations will be helpful for sustainable export growth.","[Shao, Jun; Xu, Kangning; Qiu, Bin] Southeast Univ, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Shao, J (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shaojunseu@163.com; xkn@seu.edu.cn; b_qiu@126.com,"Kangning, Xu/D-5680-2011",,,,,,24,15,17,1,49,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2012,20.0,4,,,,,56,73,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01295.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,981VY,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307001700004,0

Applications of this method include studies of intra-industry trade (IIT) and analyses of industrial 'competitiveness.' This literature seems to assume that export quality and export price (the most natural interpretation of UEV) are not merely correlated but that they follow each other one-for-one. We put this assumption under scrutiny from both a theoretical and empirical point of view. In terms of theory, we formalize this assumption as a hypothesis of the proportionality of equilibrium prices and equilibrium qualities. We discuss several cases for which this hypothesis is theoretically doubtful (nonlinear utility and cost functions; strong and asymmetric horizontal product differentiation). We also suggest a method of verifying the hypothesis for cases in which it cannot be easily rejected theoretically. This method is then applied to German imports in the period of 1994-2009. We find that the implications of the proportionality hypothesis are largely contradicted by the data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using a large dataset of matched father-son pairs in Sweden, we find that intergenerational transmission is very strong at the top, more so for income than for earnings. At the extreme top (top 0.1%) income transmission is remarkable with an intergenerational elasticity of approximately 0.9. We also study potential transmission mechanisms and find that IQ non-cognitive skills and education of the sons are all unlikely channels in explaining the strong transmission. Within the top percentile, increases in the income of the fathers, if they are related at all, are negatively associated with these variables. Wealth, on the other hand, has a significantly positive association. Our results suggest that Sweden, known for having relatively high intergenerational mobility in general, is a society in which transmission remains strong at the very top of the distribution and wealth is the most likely channel.

The real wage responses after a permanent increase in productivity tilt the balance clearly in favor of the standard model. The sticky information model overestimates the speed of adjustment in the real wage and is hence particularly unsuccessful in replicating its inertial response, whereas the standard model relies on inflation indexation in wage-setting to achieve a better fit.

Using panel data from India, we find that children whose parents experience infertility are less likely to be underweight.

This paper tests whether the tax system can alter the decision to contract a civil union, which is less binding than a marital contract. In 1999, France introduced civil union (pacs) as an alternative legal union to marriage. I assess the impact of taxation on the decision to contract a pacs using a difference-in-differences evaluation of the 2005 income tax reform for newly pacsed couples. As the control group is contaminated by the reform, I propose an original estimation method based on a difference-in-differences-in-differences setting to estimate bounds to the impact of the reform. My results find a positive and increasing impact of taxation on pacs rates, but also a change in the timing of pacs unions suggesting that taxation alters the decision to contract a pacs. In addition, I find a slightly significant impact of taxation on the decision to terminate a pacs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It also reviews how workers affected by labour mobility fare and discusses policy options to support them. The upshot is that stringent employment protection has a sizeable negative effect on labour market flows and, through this channel, hinders productivity growth. At the same time, the evidence also shows that while greater labour market reallocation benefits many workers through higher real wages and better careers, some displaced workers lose out via longer unemployment durations and/or lower real wages in post-displacement jobs. In this context, reforms of employment protection should be considered as part of a comprehensive package that also includes an adequate safety net for the unemployed and effective re-employment services.","[Martin, John P.; Scarpetta, Stefano] OECD, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Scarpetta, S (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",stefano.scarpetta@oecd.org,,,,,,,85,44,48,3,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2012,160.0,2,,,SI,,89,116,,10.1007/s10645-011-9177-2,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,935RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000303536700002,0

It focuses on addressing econometric and empirical issues that cast doubt about the validity of such positive impact. It also allows for the possibilities that the effect of undervaluation on growth operates with delay or dependent on the persistence or the level of undervaluation. We did not find any convincing support to the claim that a depreciated real exchange rate promotes economic growth. We argue that the contrast between our results and the documented examples of a successful adoption of undervaluation strategy reported in the literature reveals that undervaluation alone is not enough to boost growth.

We also found that more pronounced anti-herding leads to less accurate forecasts.","[Stadtmann, Georg] Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Stadtmann, Georg] European Univ Viadrina, D-15207 Frankfurt, Oder, Germany; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany; [Ruelke, Jan-Christoph] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dept Econ, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; European University Viadrina Frankfurt Oder; Helmut Schmidt University; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Stadtmann, G (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",Stadtmann@europa-uni.de,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

A synthesized framework of analysis (using technological stock and logistic growth function) is proposed to highlight the virtuous cycle between R&D investment, technology stock and growth. The results suggest that two of the selected firms (Proton and Golden Hope), indeed, showed better technological progress. However, Proton seems to achieve the maturity stage of technology and further needs to enhance its technology capability to drive its performance in the future. In contrast, TNB is found to lack the technological development to promote performance. The results, on the one hand, suggest that technology development is mostly progressive with high returns in the areas where the country has definite comparative advantage (e.g. oil palm) and when better partnership exists. On the other hand, in a highly protective market, the technological progress is slow the case of energy sector - and contribution of technology progress towards growth is in lack as in the case of automotive sector. Case comparison suggests that attempts to develop technology require competitive market with less government protective measures.","[Wong, Chan-Yuan] Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Kuala Lumpur 50610, Malaysia; [Govindaraju, V.

While all firms have been affected by the crisis, the effect on large firms has been mainly at the intensive margin and has resulted in a smaller portfolio of products being offered to export destinations. The effect on smaller exporters has been to reduce the range of destinations served or to stop exporting altogether. Credit constraints have been an added aggravation for firms active in high financial dependence sectors. However, the share of credit constrained firms is small and their number has not increased hugely during the crisis, with the result that the overall impact of credit constraints on trade has been limited.

Given the renewed interest of economists in norms, the literature on third-party punishment is surprisingly thin. In this paper, we report the results of an experiment designed to replicate the anger-based punishment of directly affected second parties and evaluate two distinct explanations for third-party punishment: indignation and group reciprocity. We find evidence in favor of both, with the caveat that the incidence of indignation-driven sanctions is perhaps smaller than earlier studies have hinted. Furthermore, our results suggest that second parties use sanctions to promote conformism while third parties intervene primarily to promote efficiency.","[Carpenter, Jeffrey P.; Matthews, Peter Hans] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Carpenter, JP (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",jpc@middlebury.edu; pmatthew@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,41,48,52,2,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

In practice, widespread variation exists in how child labor is measured. Questionnaire modules vary across countries and within countries over time along several dimensions, including respondent type and the structure of the questionnaire. Little is known about the effect of these differences on child labor statistics. This paper presents the results from a randomized survey experiment in Tanzania focusing on two survey design choices: different questionnaire design to classify children work and proxy response versus self-reporting. Use of a short module compared with a more detailed questionnaire has a statistically significant effect, especially on child labor force participation rates, and, to a lesser extent, on working hours. Proxy reports do not differ significantly from a child's self-report. Further analysis demonstrates that survey design choices affect the coefficient estimates of some determinants of child labor in a child labor supply equation. The results suggest that low-cost changes to questionnaire design will potentially clarify the concept of work for respondents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from Italy, where the main private television network is owned by Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of the center-right coalition, and the public television corporation is largely controlled by the ruling coalition. We first document that after the 2001 national elections, when the control of the government moved from the center-left to the center-right, news content on public television shifted to the right. Using individual survey data, we find robust evidence that viewers responded to these changes by modifying their choice of favorite news programs. On the one hand, right-leaning viewers increased their propensity to watch public channels which, even after the change, remained to the left of private channels. On the other hand, left-wing viewers reacted by switching from the main public channel to another public channel that was controlled by the left during both periods. We show that this behavioral response, which tended to shift ideological exposure to the left, significantly, though only partially, offset the movement of public news content to the right.","[Durante, Ruben] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Knight, Brian] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Brown University,"Durante, R (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",Ruben.Durante@Sciences-Po.org; Brian_Knight@brown.edu,,"Durante, Ruben/0000-0003-2833-0063",,,,,21,112,127,2,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Simple use of these devices can offer the prospect of more timely data entry and greater accuracy in guiding respondents through skip patterns. Further benefits are possible through the use of more complex consistency checks. We use PDAs to measure sales and profits for microenterprises, which are notoriously noisy. Consistency checks in the cross-section compare sales and profits, while those in the panel query responses which result in large changes from one period to the next. Cross-sectional checks also served as a second prompt in the case of missing profits. These checks do succeed in reducing the standard deviation and in increasing the correlation of the observations for which corrections are made. However, we find that the vast majority of large changes in enterprise sales and profits are confirmed by firm owners as genuine, highlighting the volatility of income in this sector. As a result, the overall impact of these consistency checks on the full sample is rather limited, suggesting that while such checks are useful if computerized forms of data collection are being used, the consistency checks per se are not a strong reason for using computerized data collection in collecting firm profits and sales.

Exogenous tax increases in the United States (from Romer and Romer 2010) are only partially offset by changes in domestic private savings, and only a small amount is absorbed by increased domestic investment (contra Feldstein and Horioka 1980). Almost half the change in taxes is transmitted abroad through a change in the US current account.

At the end of a learning-by-doing period, workers paid the minimum wage quit bad jobs for better-paying good jobs, following an on-the-job search process with endogenous search intensity. A rise in the minimum wage reduces bad jobs creation and prompts workers to keep their bad jobs by reducing on-the-job search intensity. The ambiguous impact on unqualified employment replicates and explains the findings of several empirical studies. However, a minimum wage rise reduces overall employment and output.

This finding is robust to sub-samples, and to using VIX innovations to control for dividend yield and trading volume effects. Monte Carlo evidence suggests that if VIX is not included, the risk-return relation is more likely to be negative or weak, in line with several previous studies. If VIX is included, the distribution of the risk-return parameter has more than 99% of its mass in the area of positive values.

We show that in the simple message space, (i) the matchmaker's profit is always zero and an acceptable assignment is achieved in every Nash equilibrium, and (ii) the sets of stable assignments and strong Nash equilibria are equivalent.

Thus an equilibrium selection result similar to those on robustness to incomplete information (Morris and Ui (2005) [14]), and on perfect foresight dynamic (Oyama et al. (2008) [18]) holds for the log-linear dynamic. An example shows that stochastic stability of an LP-max is not guaranteed for non-potential games without the supermodularity condition. We investigate sensitivity of the log-linear dynamic to cardinal payoffs and its consequence on the stability of weighted local potential maximizer. In particular, for 2 x 2 games, we examine a modified log-linear dynamic (relative log-linear dynamic) under which local potential maximizer with positive weights is stochastically stable. The proof of the main result relies on an elementary method for stochastic ordering of Markov chains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we present a complete picture of equilibrium selection for asymmetric binary choice coordination games in the small noise limit. We achieve this by transforming the stochastic stability analysis into an optimal control problem, which can be solved analytically. This approach allows us to obtain precise and clean equilibrium selection results for all canonical noisy best-response dynamics which have been proposed so far in the literature, among which we find the best-response with mutations dynamics, the logit dynamics and the probit dynamics.

In such an environment, the question arises of how the nearly universally documented phenomenon of loss aversion affects the adaptive dynamics. We analyse the impact of loss aversion in a simple auction using the experienced-weighted attraction model of learning.

A. Farmer [Expectations, Employment and Prices. New York: Oxford University Press (2010)] to answer two questions: (1) Do increased government purchases crowd out private consumption? (2) Do increased government purchases reduce unemployment? Farmer compared permanent tax-financed expenditure paths and showed that the answer to (1) was yes and the answer to (2) was no. We generalize his result to temporary bond-financed paths of government purchases that are similar to the actual path that occurred during WWII. We find that a temporary increase in government purchases does crowd out private consumption expenditure as in Farmer. However, in contrast to Farmer's experiment, we find that a temporary increase in government purchases can also reduce unemployment.","[Farmer, Roger E.

We adopt the viewpoint of a benevolent social planner who aims at treating in a fair manner the successive overlapping generations participating to such a long-term mandatory system. Using the approach of El Karoui and Jeanblanc (1998) for the optimal consumption and portfolio choice problem with random income in a complete market, we exhibit a solution to our intertemporal stochastic control problem where each generation receives a fair (lumpsum) retirement benefit: it is proportional to the contributions she has paid during her active worklife and follows a fixed common rule (although her pension value itself may depend on variables only observable at her retirement time). We next relax the assumption that the collective pension system is mandatory and investigate the performance of individual investment plans in the market. Comparing the outcomes of both alternatives, we derive a condition under which the collective fund can be expected to overperform the individual plan. In the special case of a stationary economy, such a possibility has been pointed out by Collier (2008). In fact this effect results from the possibility for the collective fund to borrow today against contributions of future generations, which allows to implement riskier strategies and may improve its performance.

We show that the manufacturers always choose in-house production in Cournot and Bertrand competition, when outsourcing and in-house production follow the same ex ante cost distribution. When the manufacturers compete in Cournot fashion, the cost of information rent always exceeds the benefit of reduced competition under outsourcing.

This fact is true under both social security regimes: pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and fully funded (FF). We consider an OLG economy where the government, in addition to running social security, also funds education via a dedicated tax. The education tax rates are chosen, in each period, by a majoritarian rule. We demonstrate, contrary to conjectures in the literature, that the FF social security system produces political support for a relatively higher (compared to PAYG) education funding, and hence generates higher rates of human capital accumulation, physical capital accumulation, and economic growth, Furthermore, it also results in a comparatively lower degree of income inequality.

If the voters are only weakly influenced by advertising or if permissible campaign spending is small, then the candidates choose policies close to the median voter's ideal point, but the contributors still determine the winner.

This paper offers a possible explanation of why agents in poor countries choose to engage in more unsafe sexual activities when they are perfectly cognizant of the risk involved. It is shown that agents may rationally choose to do so when they are poor, since future is not attractive due to poverty and agents care more about current-period utility. Our results indicate that safe sexual practice is essentially a normal good and that development may be key to reduce the HIV infectivity by modifying agents' sexual behavior. The model is then extended to consider the role of public health expenditure. We find that the relationship between protected sexual activity and development is no longer monotonic: unsafe sexual activity may increase slightly after a critical level of development has been reached. Finally, we examine the impacts of AIDS on development by considering individual's saving decision.

Access to capital is particularly important for the retail sector; the role of capital in recovery for manufacturing and services sectors may be limited by disruptions in supply chains.

Many banks were unable to create sufficient liquidity and had to receive government support or face default. This paper attempts to determine the impact of the financial crisis on liquidity creation within South African banks using a model previously applied to US banks. Four measures of liquidity creation are discussed and applied to data spanning 2004-2009. Although created, liquidity decreases steeply from 2007, liquidity levels in 2009 remain about 45% higher than those of 2004. The four large South African banks created about 80% of the total market liquidity. The authors are aware that the liquidity measures discussed in this paper may not accurately reflect the manner in which South African banks created liquidity before and during the financial crisis as the period under review was characterised by various other factors. These factors include the concurrent rise in securitisation, considerable changes in the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) stance on monetary policy, historic low-interest rates during the period and severe curtailing of local inter-bank dealing. It remains possible that these factors may have had an impact on the way in which South African banks created and disseminated liquidity. This possibility will be the subject of future research.","[Esterhuysen, Ja'nel] Absa Capital, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Van Vuuren, Gary; Styger, Paul] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Esterhuysen, J (通讯作者)，Absa Capital, Johannesburg, South Africa.",janel.esterhuysen@absacapital.com,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,32,1,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Bolsa provides cash payments to poor households if their children (ages 6 to 15) are enrolled in school. Using school census data to compare changes in enrollment, dropping out and grade promotion across schools that adopted Bolsa at different times, we estimate that the program has: increased enrollment by about 5.5% (6.5%) in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8); lowered dropout rates by 0.5 (0.4) percentage points in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8); and raised grade promotion rates by 0.9 (0.3) percentage points in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8). About one third of Brazil's children participate in Bolsa, so assuming no spillover effects onto non-participants implies that Bolsa's impacts are three times higher than these estimates. However, simple calculations using enrollment impacts suggest that Bolsa's benefits in terms of increased wages may not exceed its costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The combination of growing productivity and the stagnant or even falling real wages of productive workers increased the rate of surplus value in the recent decades to unprecedented highs. As a consequence, the general rate of profit from the early 1980s onwards was also rising until the last years of our analysis; meanwhile the net rate of profit remained at levels much lower than those of the 1960s and the slightly rising trend during the post-1980s has been already reversed.

The trade-offs with development vary across forest locations. We argue that considering location in three ways helps to predict policy impact and improve policy choice: (i) policy impacts vary by location because baseline deforestation varies with characteristics (market distances, slopes, soils, etc.) of locations in a landscape; (ii) different mixes of political-economic pressures drive the location of different policies; and (iii) policies can trigger osecond-order' or ospillover' effects likely to differ by location. We provide empirical evidence that suggests the importance of all three considerations, by reviewing high-quality evaluations of the impact of conservation and development on forest. Impacts of well-enforced conservation rise with private clearing pressure, supporting (i). Protection types (e.g. federal/state) differ in locations and thus in impacts, supporting (ii).

Here, we postulate an economy with two worker types (wage capacities), in which the unskilled are more numerous than the skilled. Preferences are quasi-linear in income and leisure. One political party represents each worker type. A tax policy is any feasible incentive-compatible menu of pre- and post-tax incomes from which each worker must choose. This policy space is three-dimensional. Workers vote stochastically. The equilibrium concept for political competition is party-unanimity Nash equilibrium (PUNE)-thus, parties are both vote-seeking and representative. The set of political equilibria is characterized. We prove that, if the class of unskilled workers is not too large (but greater than one-half), then there always exist equilibria in which a regressive tax policy wins. If, however, that class is sufficiently numerous, or inequality is sufficiently great, then the victory of a progressive policy is guaranteed in all equilibria.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Roemer, JE (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",John.roemer@yale.edu,,,,,,,14,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We argue that in such transition economies stabilization programs can have a negative impact on the fiscal imbalances, offsetting to some extent the very achievement of the stabilization program. We develop a simple general equilibrium model which allows propagation of shocks in the presence of government guarantees and imperfect capital mobility. We also empirically test the impact of positive foreign interest shock on the Indian economy using a reduced form VAR approach. The econometric evidence, though broadly consistent with the main predictions of the model, suggests no significant impact of foreign interest rate shock on output and credit. We conclude that incomplete liberalization of the financial sector in transition economies has two effects. It reduces i) exposure to external financial shocks (like the current credit crisis) and ii) ability to deal with real sector shocks (which may arise from global recession in the medium term) due to endogenous policy reversals and presence of government guarantees.

While it is possible to speculate which groups are likely to be hardest-hit, detailed distributional studies are still largely backward-looking due to a lack of real-time microdata. This paper studies the distributional and fiscal implications of output changes in Germany 2008-2009, using data available prior to the economic downturn. We first estimate labor demand on 12 years of detailed, administrative matched employer-employee data. The distributional analysis is then conducted by transposing predicted employment effects of actual output shocks to household-level microdata. A scenario in which labor demand adjustments occur at the intensive margin (hour changes), close to the German experience, shows less severe effects on the income distribution compared to a situation where adjustments take place through massive layoffs. Adjustments at the intensive margin are also preferable from a fiscal point of view. In this context, we discuss the cushioning effect of the tax-benefit system and the conditions under which German-style work-sharing policies can be successful in other countries.","[Peichl, Andreas] Univ Cologne, IZA, ISER, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Peichl, Andreas] Univ Cologne, CESifo, D-53072 Bonn, Germany; [Immervoll, Herwig] OECD, F-75775 Paris, France; [Immervoll, Herwig] IZA, F-75775 Paris, France; [Bargain, Olivier] UC Dublin, IZA, Geary Inst, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bargain, Olivier] CHILD, Dublin 4, Ireland",University of Cologne; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of Cologne; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Peichl, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, IZA, ISER, POB 7240, D-53072 Bonn, Germany.",olivier.bargain@ucd.ie; herwig.immervoll@oecd.org; peichl@iza.org; siegloch@iza.org,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018; Bargain, Olivier/A-5972-2019",,,,,,36,10,11,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Using evolutionary game theory, we provide existence conditions for a potential function, which characterizes the global configuration of the city and is maximized in the stationary state. We use this potential function to analyze the outcome of the model for three utility functions corresponding to different degrees of preference for mixed neighborhoods: (i) we show that linear utility functions is the only case where the potential function is proportional to collective utility, the latter being therefore maximized in stationary configurations; (ii) Schelling's original utility function is shown to drive segregation at the expense of collective utility; (iii) if agents have a strict preference for mixed neighborhoods but also prefer to be in the majority versus the minority, the model converges to perfectly segregated configurations, which clearly diverge from the social optimum. Departing from the existing literature, these conclusions are based on analytical results which open the way to analysis of many preference structures. Since our model is based on bounded rather than continuous neighborhoods as in Schelling's original model, we discuss the differences generated by the bounded- and continuous-neighborhood definitions and show that, in the case of the continuous neighborhood, a potential function exists if and only if the utility functions are linear. A side result is that our analysis builds a bridge between Schelling's model and the Duncan and Duncan segregation index. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since income level is among the most important determinants of cultural demand, and income fluctuates with business cycles, examining the relationship between cultural expenditures and business cycles is useful, particularly in discussing income elasticity of cultural demand. The data used are monthly household expenditures for movies, live performances, and cultural establishments in the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Turning points for cultural expenditures and related indicators are determined by estimating the regime-switching model. The lead-lag relationship between these series and the reference dates of Japanese business cycles are analyzed. The result indicates that cultural expenditures fluctuate cyclically with unstable leads and lags corresponding to business cycles. In addition, cultural expenditures adhere to smaller specific cycles within officially designated expansions, which imply that income elasticity has not been constant during past business cycles.","Meijo Univ, Fac Econ, Tempaku Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4688502, Japan",Meijo University,"Katsuura, M (通讯作者)，Meijo Univ, Fac Econ, Tempaku Ku, 1-501 Shiogamaguchi, Nagoya, Aichi 4688502, Japan.",katsuura@meijo-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330073] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,34,3,3,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Unless the facility is congested, efficient short run prices should only cover operating costs (short-run marginal cost, SMC); any higher price designed to also recover capital costs would risk inefficient under-utilization. However, if the facility becomes crowded, capital costs should be included in the calculation of user-fees since that burgeoning demand is likely to cause the construction of more capacity, and users should be confronted with the cost-consequences of their decisions. Once additional capacity is completed, however, and if because of the large size of the addition the facility is no longer congested, then price should once again fall to SMC. The resulting jagged pattern of prices offers little assurance to investors of capital cost-recovery without a government guarantee, and it may lead to schizophrenic behavior by both customers and potential suppliers. Just because the physical investment is lumpy, should the price pattern also be dichotomous or can a smoother transition be employed? By integrating the use of congestion fees that are based upon the external costs imposed by one user on all others prior to the construction of added capacity, and then by using the same congestion charge to gauge the willingness-to-pay for new capacity and to set an opportunity-cost-based benchmark for capital cost recovery afterward, a smoother sequence of prices can evolve. The capital cost recovery portion of these prices, whose magnitude is based upon the congestion eliminated, is premised on a long-run, dynamic view of markets and the transitions they can facilitate, and these cost-recovery adders can be combined with peak-load-pricing and the inverse-elasticity rule, for example, to improve efficiency and fairness over both space and time. The resulting price patterns can provide compatible incentives for all parties, and they complement several existing electricity system planning processes in those regions where congestion rents are already assessed for the use of transmission. The net effect could be similar to a sequential real-options analysis of efficient capacity expansion.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Schuler, RE (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",res1@cornell.edu,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Guidance is provided on measuring policy-induced labor demand, estimating the demand shock's impact on labor market outcomes, and translating labor market impacts into efficiency benefits. Two measures are proposed for efficiency benefits, one relying on adjusted reservation wage gains and the other relying on adjusted earnings gains.","WE Upjohn Inst Employment Res, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA",W.E.

In particular, if we relax two strong assumptions, those of perfect information in the labor market and individual homogeneity, less-developed countries may remain caught in a poverty trap even when there are not intergenerational or intertemporal spillovers, intersectoral complementarities, increasing returns to scale or credit market imperfections. Due to the lack of coordination among workers, the role played by some institutions such as universities or unions in escaping the trap becomes crucial. A numerical calibration of the model supports our conclusions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Seventy-five commercial poultry farms (25 and 50 independent and contract farms, respectively) were randomly selected. The results reveal that efficiency scores vary across sample farms. To explain some of these variations, the efficiency scores were regressed on some human capital variables and farming system using a Tobit model. The study also estimates elasticities to provide the information on the magnitude of the influence of variables on Technical Efficiency (TE), Allocative Efficiency (AE) and Economic Efficiency (EE). The results show that the contracting system is positively and significantly related to the farm's TE, AE and EE. This is expected because under contractual agreement, in order to obtain sufficient supplies of the right quality of poultry meat at the right time, the company provides technical know how assistance through company's recruited supervisor, production inputs and services, and production credit along with intensive supervision, which in turn improves farm efficiency. Thus, by receiving technical know how contract farmers have gained more knowledge on their resource and practices, which enables them to use resources more efficiently. Empirical results can provide crucial information to policy makers that improve poultry farm efficiency.","[Begum, Ismat Ara; Alam, Mohammad Jahangir; Buysse, Jeroen; Frija, Aymen; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Begum, Ismat Ara] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh; [Alam, Mohammad Jahangir] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Mkt, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh",Ghent University; Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU),"Begum, IA (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, 653 Coupure Links, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",ishameen@yahoo.com,"Frija, Aymen/D-8296-2016; Van Huylenbroeck, Guido/L-9251-2017","Frija, Aymen/0000-0001-8379-9054; Begum, Ismat Ara/0000-0002-9953-4138; Alam, Mohammad Jahangir/0000-0003-3412-9438",,,,,30,32,35,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The level of public spending depends on taxes that are decided by a voting mechanism. Policymakers also decide how to allocate funds among different policies, such as public education and pure redistributive transfers. How are the levels of funding for public education and redistribution determined in the political process? What impacts do votes on these two policies have on inequality, growth and social mobility? We develop a politico-economic model that highlights a novel mechanism: public education provides opportunities for the children of the poor to be recognized for their talent. This reduces the probability of a mismatch, which takes place when individuals with low talent who come from rich families find jobs that should go to people with high talent (and vice versa). Hence, the poor may prefer public spending on education to direct redistribution, while the rich prefer redistribution, as education implies more competition for good jobs from the poor.

From the empirical analyses of data from the Billboard Hot 100 chart, he concluded that a number one hit's 'life at the top' is enhanced significantly if it is recorded by a female solo artist, if it is an instrumental piece or if it is able to 'bounce back' for a second spell. We found that, however, the data set he used contains a number of errors in it. In this article, we have corrected such errors and obtained the more reliable results about the survival characteristics of number one hit songs.

This article assesses policy coordination from both a technical, but more particularly, a political economy angle. It concludes that the scope for formal and detailed policy coordination is strictly limited because of the underlying political constraints.

The study uses a modified version of the Staples dispute to define the estimation equations. We also include other statistical models to analyze price competition among supermarkets. The study does include three ways of measuring the relevant market. First, we define a geographic market in which all supermarkets included in a 5 kilometer radius are competing with the pivot store (the store that we have information on prices). This radius is valid for the three largest cities in Mexico (Mexico, Guadalajara and Monterrey). For the rest of the cities we consider a radius of 8 km. In a second approach we define two circles for all pivot stores in the country. In a first circle we include all stores within a 5 km distance from the pivot store. In a second circle we include all stores located between 5 and 8 kilometers from the pivot store. In a third approach we consider the municipality as the geographical market. We find that supermarket chains have different pricing policies that vary according to the number and identity of rivals. We also find that Walmart does not compete strongly in prices. In fact, in those markets in which the number of Walmart stores increases, the rivals tend to increase prices. We also find that stores fix lower prices whenever there are more chains in the relevant market.","[Castaneda Sabido, Alejandro] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Sabido, AC (通讯作者)，CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",acasta@colmex.mx,,,,,,,14,3,5,1,20,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

Her uncertainty is described by multiple beliefs (or measures) over the state space. She is pessimistic about the true beliefs, and would like to hedge her bets. This results in her having a preference for uniformity of payoffs across the various subjective states. We present a utility representation for such agents and show that our representation provides a natural measure of the agent's desire for uniformity of payoffs in the subjective states. We also show that concerns for uniformity are orthogonal to concerns about flexibility or commitment. We achieve this by relaxing the Independence axiom as applied to our environment.

To fight it, we must understand its causes. We analyze the data from Iran over the period 1984-2010. Our analysis shows that oil revenue and economic corruption in Iran are correlated. Given that corruption is likely to hinder economic development and not enhance it, and that oil revenue is largely driven by international forces outside Iran, the possible causality (if the two are causally related) flows from revenue to corruption and not reverse. Our econometric tests support this inference. We estimate that a 1% increase in oil revenue leads to 15-43% increase in bribery, embezzlement and forgery. We emphasize that this result is not necessarily conclusive for all oil-producing countries, rather we stress on Iranian case, due to its rentier state and had governance (especially under 2005-2011 administration).","[Dadgar, Yadollah] Beheshty Univ, Tehran, Iran",,"Dadgar, Y (通讯作者)，Beheshty Univ, Tehran, Iran.",,"dadgar, yadollah/AAO-8539-2021",,,,,,49,2,2,0,7,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The equilibrium distribution of wealth is explicitly calculated and its shape crucially depends on market incompleteness. With incomplete markets it follows a Paretian law in the top tail and the Pareto exponent depends on the saving rate, on the net return on capital, on the growth rate of population, and on portfolio diversification. The characteristics of the labour market crucially affects the bottom tail, but not the upper tail of the distribution of wealth in the case of completely decentralized labour market. The analysis also suggests a positive relationship between growth and wealth inequality. The theoretical predictions find a corroboration in the empirical evidence of United States in the period 1989-2004. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

France is an exceptional European counry where the declining fertility rate was reversed and successfully recovered to 1.98. The findings indicate there is a statistically significant threshold in the fertility-development relationship and a reverse in the fertility decline. Empirical findings indicate there is a statistically significant threshold in the fertility-development relationship. A significant regime change in the fertility decline occurred in France. However, empirical results indicate that reverse in the fertility decline does not seem to occur. More precisely, the empirical findings indicate a significant negative relationship between per capita GDP and TFR when income level in the country was below the threshold value. However, this negative association between the two variables does not reverse to positive when income level exceeded the threshold value.

The first section clarifies the understanding of the role and nature of the assumptions in economic theory, as well as the importance of the notion of their realisticness. Next, we refer to the Friedman's 1953 paper The Methodology of Positive Economics' and we interpret it from the realistic perspective. Therefore, we claim that abstracting from factors of secondary importance is acceptable and in many cases even desirable. However, it is doubtful skipping those factors that significantly determine the phenomena economic models explain. In the final part of the article we refer to the current discussion about the state of economic theory, in which many blame it of building models based on unrealistic assumptions. We argue that the method of isolation as such is not the problem, however, it matters of what we are abstracting from. As a result, it is not true that realistic models must be based on realistic assumptions.","[Hardt, Lukasz] Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Wydziale Nauk Ekon, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Hardt, L (通讯作者)，Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, Wydziale Nauk Ekon, Warsaw, Poland.",lhardt@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Hardt, Łukasz/N-2949-2017","Hardt, Łukasz/0000-0001-6542-5833",,,,,46,1,1,0,2,WYDAWNICTWO KEY TEXT,WARSZAWA,"UL GORCZEWSKA 8, WARSZAWA, 01-180, POLAND",0013-3205,2299-6184,,EKONOMISTA,Ekonomista,,2012,,1,,,,,21,40,,,,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,902FH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000301023500003,0

First, we show that despite students' disadvantaged backgrounds and despite not having more financial resources than similar schools, there are schools in Chile that serve low-income students and that obtain superior academic outcomes. Second, we present qualitative evidence to identify school and classroom processes that might explain these good results. Specifically, we analyse a network of Chilean private voucher schools called Sociedad de Instruccion Primaria (SIP). In the econometric analysis we use a number of propensity score-based estimation methods to find that SIP students' achievement is not due to observables or selection on measured variables. We also perform a number of interviews in SIP schools and other neighbouring schools. Our qualitative analysis suggests that having children's learning as a central and permanent goal, an aim that is shared and that drives the community's efforts, seems to best summarize what makes SIP schools special.","[Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Repetto, Andrea] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile; [Henriquez, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Henriquez, Francisco] Minist Educ, Santiago, Chile; [Lara, Bernardo] Stanford Univ, Sch Educ, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Stanford University,"Mizala, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Santiago, Chile.",amizala@dii.uchile.cl,"Lara E, Bernardo/HJY-7986-2023; Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; , CIAE/R-5423-2017; Repetto, Andrea/AAF-7404-2021; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013","Lara E, Bernardo/0000-0003-2031-2741; Repetto, Andrea/0000-0003-2378-9684; Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677",,,,,18,2,6,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our main findings are as follows. First, technology diffusion is all-pervading in half of the sampled countries due to pure efficiency and scale efficiency changes. Second, a higher-income level and an excess of arms imports lead to innovative activities. Third, middle-income countries have higher efficiency and pure efficiency changes; these contribute to higher total productivity change. Finally, after separating the impact of capital investment from that of arms imports, the diffusion of military technology has a more positive and substantial impact on economic growth, thereby revealing the presence of externalities between countries.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Hsu, Yi-Chung] Natl Taichung Inst Technol, Dept Publ Finance & Taxat, Taichung, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,38,4,5,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, we prove that the transhistorical and nominalist approaches show different weaknesses and can not account for the constitutive dimensions of value. Within this context, we demonstrate why value emerged in the first place and what epistemological dimensions it provided and enabled for economic reflexivity. In addition, we demonstrate that it is impossible to understand inherent value as an immanent property of goods in economic transactions and we critique the approach that renders value to the theory of price. Economic relations reflect value-related aspects without which the relations could not be understood. We then analyze the interrelations between power and value, proving the constitutive dimension of power in understanding value, demonstrated in selected examples. We treat power as a constellation in which economic agents act on other subjects to provoke certain activity. Power may occur only where the behaviour of subjects is not entirely determined. Finally, one additional selected example shows the range of this theory of power in terms of positional goods.","[Josifidis, Kosta] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Losonc, Alpar] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Social Sci, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Josifidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Dept European Econ & Business, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",josifidis@gmail.com; coma@eunet.rs,,,,,,,83,4,5,1,20,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59.0,4,,,,,501,519,,10.2298/PAN1204501J,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,020GX,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309798100006,0

The author proves that capital structure is affected not only by the traditional determinants related to a business entity (such as industry, profitability, size and growth potential) but also macroeconomic/institutional factors including economic growth, inflation rates, corporate income taxes, the development of the banking sector and capital markets and national legal frameworks. It is the first time literature has recorded different corporate capital structures in new and old EU member states as well as different capital structure determinants. The empirical material is consistent in terms of the accounting valuation - for the first time recorded in literature - which is proved by the statistical analysis.

Most of the austerity measures preceded the depression, which had already begun receding by the time Warren Harding implemented the relatively modest spending and tax cuts that are cited by modern proponents of austerity. The evidence suggests that the 1920-21 depression was the result of a variety of supply constraints, rather than a deficiency of effective demand, and is therefore a poor test of the efficacy of Keynesian fiscal policy.","[Kuehn, Daniel] American Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Kuehn, D (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Kreeger Bldg,4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",dk8229a@american.edu,,,,,,,12,5,7,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Research on the relationship between the two has provided mixed results across a variety of data sets and empirical methods. Common throughout this research, however, is the use of parametric frameworks for empirical analyses. This study moves beyond parametric methods by examining the relationship between childhood obesity and food insecurity among low-income children with nonparametric regression techniques. We examine data from the Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a nationally representative data set from the US. Consistent with recent work, our parametric analyses indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between childhood obesity and food insecurity. In contrast, our nonparametric results indicate that the probability of being obese varies markedly with the level of food insecurity being experienced by the child. Moreover, this relationship differs across relevant subgroups including those defined by gender, race/ethnicity and income. Fully understanding the relationship between childhood obesity and food insecurity has significant policy implications.","[Kuku, Oluyemisi; Garasky, Steven] Iowa State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Gundersen, Craig] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Iowa State University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Garasky, S (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, 4380 Palmer Bldg,Room 2330, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",sgarasky@iastate.edu,,,,,,,54,17,22,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Unlike elsewhere, in Germany such bans were introduced at state level at different points in time, which provides important intra-country regional variation that can be exploited to identify the effects of such bans on the hospitality industry. Using monthly data from a compulsory survey carried out by the German Federal Statistical Office, we study the short-run effects that these bans had on establishments' sales. In contrast to the largely US-based literature, we find that smoke-free policies had a negative (yet moderate) effect on establishment sales. Closure rates of businesses in the hospitality industry, however, were not significantly affected by the introduction of state smoking bans.","[Kvasnicka, Michael; Tauchmann, Harald] Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Res Div Lab Markets Educ Populat, D-45128 Essen, Germany; Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Res Div Hlth Econ, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Tauchmann, H (通讯作者)，Rheinisch Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RWI, Res Div Lab Markets Educ Populat, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",harald.tauchmann@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,23,12,13,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As the basis we take economic reforms aiming at sustainable and timely operations through setting the economically grounded planned tasks. Attention is also paid to state regulation of the economy's management on the horizontal level by means of the improved contractual relations. Prospective planning is highlighted at various stages of management, taking into account the priorities of economic development shaping the economic policy in the long term.

First, we highlight the importance of clearly identifying the target of trust, particularly for obtaining concordance between attitudinal and behavioral measures of trust. Second, we introduce a novel behavioral measure of (dis)trust, based on individuals' willingness to pay to avoid being vulnerable to the target of trust. We conduct an experiment in which we vary the target of trust among passersby at several locations around a city, measuring both behavioral distrust and trust attitudes towards these varying targets. We find that subjects discriminate based on perceived characteristics of different targets in determining whether to trust, in a manner consistent with trust elicited using attitudinal measures and with actual trustworthiness.

Maintaining the relationships between the willingness to pay of consumers with high and low incomes in the two periods, if durable goods producing monopoly's option is to discriminate prices over time, the price is more likely to rise, the greater the variation between the high-income consumer's willingness to pay in the future period, due to the perspective of increased income, and his willingness to pay in the present period. In addition, the lower the interest rates, the greater the possibility of the price rising is. If the high-income consumer foresees a considerable reduction in his income in the future period, the low-income consumer forecasting a comparable increase in income in that period, changing the relationships between consumers' willingness to pay, the price will also increase, since the monopoly manages to absorb the maximum price each consumer is ready to pay in each period.","Univ Beira Interior, Dept Managment & Econ, Covilha, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior,"Nunes, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Dept Managment & Econ, Covilha, Portugal.",,,"Macas Nunes, Paulo/0000-0001-9399-2528",,,,,11,0,0,1,4,NATL ACAD MANAGEMENT,KYIV,"VUL PANASA MYMOGO 26, KYIV, 01011, UKRAINE",1993-6788,,,ACTUAL PROBL ECON,Actual Probl.

The results of our study show that there is an overwhelming causal flow from tourism development to poverty reduction in South Africa. This finding has an important policy implication - as it demonstrates that the tourism sector, which has shown a phenomenal growth in South Africa in recent years, leads to poverty reduction. Other results show that, while tourism development Granger-causes trade both in the short run and in the long run, the causality from trade to tourism could only be established in the short run.

The period can be characterized as a transition when long-run productivity growth in the Swedish economy improved from being among the weakest to one of the strongest within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In order to present a detailed exploration of this dramatic change, the time trend and general index models are applied to estimate Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth, rate of technical change and returns to scale. The models are extended to allow for firm specific as well as time-varying technical change. The parametric TFP measures are also compared with the nonparametric Solow residual, and several hypotheses are tested to explain the growth patterns in the Swedish economy. It is found that the improved growth rate, initially starting in large exporting manufacturing firms, after a deep economic crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, spilled over to the rest of the economy, both manufacturing and services.","[Loof, Hans] Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Oh, Donghyun] Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Heshmati, Almas] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Royal Institute of Technology; Samsung; Korea University,"Lööf, H (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Excellence Sci & Innovat Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",hans.loof@abe.kth.se,"Lööf, Hans/C-2137-2017; Lööf, Hans/AAN-5394-2020","Lööf, Hans/0000-0002-5871-8571;",,,,,38,13,14,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Hence, examining output relationships among them becomes necessary. This work finds a long run cointegrating relationship in output among these countries. The US economy remains exogenous in the short run error correction mechanism, but China and India correct any deviations from this equilibrium relationship. While theory expects a positive response of China and India to an output shock in America, India, and China respond in a significantly negative fashion to the US economy, as found in impulse responses. The US explains a major share of output variance in these Asian economies, but the reverse is not true. These findings have policy implications not only for India and China, but also for other developing nations that are growing fast through globalization and embracing further integration with the US economy.","SUNY Coll Cortland, Dept Econ, Cortland, NY 13045 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Cortland,"Paul, BP (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Cortland, Dept Econ, Cortland, NY 13045 USA.",biru.paul@cortland.edu,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Three utility frameworks are assumed in the paper: constant relative risk aversion, habit formation and Epstein-Zin utility. Data on equity premiums are analyzed for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The comparison of Hansen-Jagannathan bounds with the restrictions given by the three utility functions shows that it is not possible to expect to employ a universal approach to this issue as the conclusions differ to some extent across the economies examined.

This work aims to complement these approaches and contribute to the rather limited literature on the relationship between FDI, Human Capital and Innovation at a corporate level. Based on a set of large and innovative firms (national and foreign capital) located in China, we have concluded that (1) the direct impact of foreign capital on the level of human capital in firms is negative, that is no evidence was found suggesting that FDI has a positive influence on their human capital and (ii) in indirect terms, by means of investment in R&D (research and development) activities, FDI has a positive impact on general human capital (i.e. formal education). These results suggest that for China to benefit from FDI, it is necessary to implement a selective policy to attract FDI, taking into account more technologically advanced, R&D-based projects.","[Teixeira, Aurora A.

The novelty of our approach lies in the application of wavelet tools to commodity market data. A major part of economic time series analysis is done in the time or frequency domain separately. Wavelet analysis combines these two fundamental approaches allowing study of the time series in the time-frequency domain. Using this framework, we propose a new, model-free way of estimating time-varying correlations. In the empirical analysis, we connect our approach to the dynamic conditional correlation approach of Engle (2002) on the main components of the energy sector. Namely, we use crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas on a nearest-future basis over a period of approximately 16 and 1/2 years beginning on November 1, 1993 and ending on July 21, 2010. Using wavelet coherence, we uncover interesting dynamics of correlations between energy commodities in the time-frequency space. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Both are related to income inequality, reduction of which will help to increase domestic demand. This paper discusses how income inequality has evolved over time. This is followed by an exploration of the consequences of high inequality. Driving forces underlying the rising inequality are analyzed before providing concrete policy recommendations. It is found that inequality declined in the early period of reform, until the mid to late 1980s, and then began a rising trend up to 2010. Major determinants of inequality include: location, institutional and policy factors, trade and globalization, and education inequality and human capital gaps along ruralurban and spatial divisions. To achieve a balanced economy and a harmonious society, development policies in China must shift from emphasizing growth to prioritizing equality. In addition, government interventions can target ruralurban disparity through rapid urbanization, and tackle regional inequality by developing financial markets, ensuring progressive allocation of fiscal resources, promoting trade and foreign direct investment in inland China, creating more formal jobs and supporting the service sector.","[Zhu, Cuiping] Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Yunan, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",Yunnan University of Finance & Economics; Asian Development Bank,"Zhu, CP (通讯作者)，Yunnan Univ Finance & Econ, Yunan, Peoples R China.",zhucuip@yahoo.com.cn; gwan@adb.org,,,,,,,42,18,22,1,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2012,20.0,1,,,SI,,83,104,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01274.x,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,899RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300835100005,0

Using a panel of 18 industrialized countries from 1978 to 2009, we find that income inequality significantly rises during periods of fiscal consolidation. In addition, while fiscal policy that is driven by spending cuts seems to be detrimental for income distribution, tax hikes seem to have an equalizing effect. We also show that the size of the fiscal consolidation program (in percentage of GDP) has an impact on income inequality. In particular, when consolidation plans represent a small share of GDP, the income gap widens, suggesting that the burden associated with the effort affects disproportionately households at the bottom of the income distribution. Considering the linkages between banking crises and fiscal consolidation, we find that the effect on the income gap is amplified when fiscal adjustments take place after the resolution of such financial turmoil. Similarly, fiscal consolidation programs combined with inflation are likely to increase inequality and the effects of fiscal adjustments on inequality are amplified during periods of relatively low growth. Our results also provide support for a non-linear relationship between inequality and income and corroborate the idea that trade can promote a more equal distribution of income.","[Agnello, Luca] Banque France, Paris, France; [Agnello, Luca] Univ Palermo, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, P-4719 Braga, Portugal",European Central Bank; Bank of France; University of Palermo; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidade do Minho,"Agnello, L (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Fac Econ, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",luca.agnello01@unipa.it,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753",,,,,65,73,73,1,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The aim of this paper is to determine whether or not changes in market uncertainty, as reflected in the VIX index, influence South African inflation. Given that the VIX index reflects market uncertainty, its impact on the inflation rate may differ between times of heightened uncertainty and normality, thus suggesting the presence of multiple regimes. To cater for this possibility, the analysis first uses the general-to-specific procedure (including squared and cubed values of dependent and independent variables) with impulse indicator saturation dummies to look for non-linear behaviour in the form of statistically significant squared and cubed variables and clustered periods of outlier dummies that might reflect an alternative regime. Finding such periods, the analysis next uses a Markov-switching model to model this non-linear behaviour explicitly. The results show that market volatility as measured by the VIX indeed explains South African inflation. Moreover, as shown by the second regime of the Markov-switching model, when market volatility is elevated, its influence on inflation also increases.","Univ Orange Free State, Dept Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Burger, P (通讯作者)，Univ Orange Free State, Dept Econ, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",BurgerP@ufs.ac.za,,"Burger, Philippe/0000-0001-6820-1130",,,,,37,2,2,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We outline the basic rationale for this development using a simple model of money and credit in which we explore the conditions under which money matters directly for the conduct of policy. Then, using a DSGE model, we examine the circumstances under which money becomes more closely linked to inflation. We find that money matters when the variance of the supply of lending dominates productivity and the velocity of money demand. This is because amplifying the role of loans supply leads to an expansion in aggregate demand, via a compression of the external finance premium, which is inflationary. We consider a number of alternative monetary policy rules, and find that a rule which exploits the joint information from money and the external finance premium performs best.","[Chadha, Jagjit S.] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Corrado, Luisa] Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; [Corrado, Luisa; Holly, Sean] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Kent; Sapienza University Rome; University of Cambridge,"Corrado, L (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ Law & Inst, Rome, Italy.",luisa.corrado@uniroma2.it,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Our paper proposes an estimation of differences in lifetime values of employment between public and private sectors for five European countries. We use data from the European Community Household Panel over the period 1994-2001 for Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Spain. We look at lifetime values instead of wage levels because, as we show in our results, differences in earnings mobility, earnings volatility and job loss risk across sectors occur in many instances and these will matter to forward-looking individuals. When aggregated into a measure of lifetime value of employment in either sector, these differences yield estimates of the lifetime premium in the public sector for these five countries. We also present differences in the institutional and labour market structures in these countries and find that countries for which we estimate a positive lifetime premium in the public sector, i.e. France and Spain, are also the countries where access to the public sector requires costly entry procedures. This paper is to the best of our knowledge the first to use this dynamic approach applied to Europe, which we are able to do with a common dataset, time-period and model. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Animal spirits are considered in terms of unsubstantiated optimism, low uncertainty perception, and low uncertainty aversion. We distinguish between animal spirits with respect to expanding capacity, on the one hand, and animal spirits with respect to innovation, on the other. The first case is analyzed primarily in terms of fluctuations in spontaneous optimism and uncertainty perception, while the emphasis for the second is more on the enduring dispositions of organizations and individuals.

We obtain, using trigger strategies, that with product differentiation collusion is always more easily sustained when firms compete in prices than when firms compete in quantities. This is true basically because (i) price competition is more intense than quantity competition, and (ii) fringe firms exacerbate the fact that cartel firms have more incentives to deviate from the agreement under quantity competition. This result reverses previous findings where, in the absence of fringe firms, product differentiation plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of price or quantity competition in sustaining collusion.","[Escrihuela-Villar, Marc] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Mallorca, Spain; [Guillen, Jorge] ESAN, Lima, Peru",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universidad ESAN,"Escrihuela-Villar, M (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Aplicada, Edificio Jovellanos Ctra,Valldemossa Km 7-3, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Baleares, Spain.",marc.escrihuela@uib.es,"Escrihuela-Villar, Marc/H-6997-2015","Escrihuela-Villar, Marc/0000-0002-5119-2415; Guillen, Jorge/0000-0002-4511-2108",,,,,13,0,0,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

These cities encounter potential cultural conflicts with the mainstream culture of the provinces they belong to, but also face various local protectionism barriers with cities in the neighboring province that share the same border and local culture with them. As a result, transaction costs could be higher whichever side they trade with, leading to potential harm to their economic development. Using dialect as a proxy for local culture, we find that the cultural segmentation caused by the misalignment between cultural and administrative borders can significantly hamper economic development of the segmented cities. This negative effect is aggravated by greater local protectionism in neighboring provinces but alleviated by a longer history of being administrated by the same province with the current provincial capital. These findings support the hypothesis that cultural and administrative border misalignment works together with local protectionism to bring about substantial economic loss. The results thus highlight the importance of both formal and informal institutions in affecting transaction costs and economic growth, and also shed light on the potential interactions between the two types of institutions.

In particular, we explore this issue in a setting where individuals face idiosyncratic risk. Incomplete information also provides a transactions role for money so that monetary policy can be studied. In contrast to standard monetary growth models which focus on the transmission of monetary policy to the demand for capital goods, we incorporate a separate capital goods sector so that the supply response to monetary policy is taken into account. Consequently, in contrast to the standard monetary growth model, monetary policy plays an important role in investment activity through the relative price of capital goods. Moreover, different sources of productivity can affect the degree of risk sharing. Although the optimal money growth rate falls in response to an increase in productivity in either sector of the economy, monetary policy should react more aggressively to the level of productivity in the capital sector.

The drastic increase in its OFDI has raised concerns as to whether the outbound direct investment activities from the country would detract from domestic investment activities, which have been sluggish since the aftermath of the Asian Currency Crisis. Using the autoregressive distrusted lag (ARDL) modelling approach to cointegration, the findings show that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship involving the four variables, i.e. between domestic investment and its determinants such as FDI outflows, FDI inflows and domestic savings. Moreover, this study reveals that the effect on domestic investment by FDI outflows is substitutional and inelastic, while that by FDI inflows is complementary and elastic, implying that the latter can overcome the substitution effect caused by the former if the Malaysian government could formulate pragmatic policies in attracting FDI inflows.","[Goh, Soo Khoon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town, Malaysia; [Wong, Koi Nyen] Sunway Univ, Sch Business, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Sunway University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Goh, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town, Malaysia.",skgoh@usm.my; koinyenw@sunway.edu.my,"Wong, Koi N/C-5711-2014; goh, soo khoon/P-1663-2015","goh, soo khoon/0000-0001-6732-0592",,,,,41,12,12,0,24,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey is used to address these issues. In order to model the income distribution, we consider the generalized beta distribution of the second kind (GB2). A pseudo-likelihood approach for fitting the distribution is considered, which takes into account the design features of the EU-SILC survey. An ad-hoc procedure for robustification of the sampling weights, which improves estimation, is presented. This method is compared to a non-linear fit from the indicators. Variance estimation within a complex survey setting of the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates is done by linearization (a sandwich variance estimator), and a simplified formula for the sandwich variance, which accounts for clustering, is given. Performance of the fit and estimated indicators is evaluated graphically and numerically.","[Graf, Monique; Nedyalkova, Desislava] Swiss Fed Stat Off, CH-2010 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Graf, Monique] Elpacos Stat, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Nedyalkova, Desislava] Univ Neuchatel, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel,"Nedyalkova, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Stat Off, Espace Europe 10, CH-2010 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",desislava.nedyalkova@bfs.admin.ch,,,,,,,39,16,17,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

After characterizing the general demand models, the CBL, based on which the demand response models are studied, is reviewed. Given the experience gained from the review and existing conditions, the study combines an appropriate model for each case for a possible application to the electricity market; moreover, it discusses the implications of the results. In the literature, these aspects are studied independently. The main contribution of this survey is attributed to the treatment of the three issues as sequentially interdependent. The reviewis expected to enhance the understanding of the demand, CBL and demand response in the electricity market and their relationships. The objective is conducted through a combination of demand and supply side managements in order to reduce demand through different demand response programs during peak times.

We find that mean per capita expenditure of urban households is consistently twice as much as that of rural households and that the urban-rural gap monotonically increases from the poorer to the richer groups of the expenditure distribution. To isolate factors contributing to the urban-rural gap, we apply the Oaxaca-Blinder type decomposition to a newly developed unconditional quantile regression method. Factors contributing significantly to the high urban-rural gap include inter-group differences in education, household age structure, labor market activity, geographic location and their related returns, with education playing the most important role. Over the period, consistent with the country's massive rural-urban migration, we find that domestic remittance plays a significant role in shortening the urban-rural expenditure gap in the later years, 2002 and 2006.","[Huong Thu Le] Griffith Univ, Mt Gravatt, Qld 4122, Australia; [Huong Thu Le] Natl Econ Univ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Booth, Alison L.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Booth, Alison L.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Griffith University; Griffith University - Mount Gravatt Campus; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Australian National University; University of Essex,"Le, HT (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Key Ctr Eth Law Justice & Governance, Mt Gravatt Campus, Mt Gravatt, Qld 4122, Australia.",huong.le@griffith.edu.au,"Huong, Le/JOJ-9777-2023; Huong, Le/AGQ-2821-2022","Huong, Le/0000-0003-4630-5734",,,,,39,36,38,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This is generally attributed to services being cheaper relative to goods in poorer countries. In this paper we re-examine the Penn-effect based on a new set of PPPs for industry output. These are estimated in an augmented Geary-Khamis approach using prices for final goods, exports, and imports. The resulting multilateral PPPs cover 35 industries in 42 countries for the year 2005. We find large variation in relative prices of various services industries. In particular the Penn-effect appears to be mostly due to the rapidly rising output prices of non-market services.

This paper derives a relation between a Lorenz curve and the modality of its underlying income density: given a parametric Lorenz curve, it is the sign of its third derivative which indicates whether the density is unimodal or zeromodal (i.e., downward-sloping). The density modality of several important Lorenz curves such as the Pareto, Weibull, Singh-Maddala parametrizations and hierarchical families of Lorenz curves are discussed. A Lorenz curve performance comparison with Monte Carlo simulations and data from the UNU-WIDER World Income Inequality Database underlines the relevance of the theoretical result: curve-fitting based on criteria such as mean squared error or the Gini difference might lead to a Lorenz curve implying an incorrectly-shaped density function. It is therefore important to take into account the modality when selecting a parametric Lorenz curve.","[Krause, Melanie] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Krause, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Chair Int Macroecon Macroeconometr, Grueneburgpl 1,House Finance, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",melanie.krause@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,"Krause, Melanie/IAN-0993-2023","Krause, Melanie/0000-0001-9299-2366",,,,,31,12,14,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The emphasis is on the incentive factor of the effort-leisure choice. Besides financing public services, part of the aid is transferred to the public. This increases individual wealth, thereby providing less incentives to individuals for human capital acquisition, but with more leisure. Thus, foreign aid may not always help the growth and welfare of the economy. Taking this incentive factor into account, we further study the issue on aid allocation in achieving the highest levels of growth and welfare. Along the balanced growth path, aid allocation for welfare maximization is different from that under growth maximization. (C) Elsevier B.V.

The paper emphasizes the sectoral composition of income and prices as mechanisms influencing the level of poverty and establishes empirically that it is the rise in non-agricultural per capita income that reduces rural poverty via the channel of internal migration, after having controlled for the variation in key components of fiscal spending and monetary/financial policy via the availability of credit. Uneven sectoral growth pattern explains why urban poverty becomes a spill-over of persistent rural poverty when the agricultural sector shrinks. While checking for robustness, there is evidence that the rise in non-agricultural income alone may not reduce rural poverty, when measured in terms of rural infant mortality rate as a non-income indicator of well-being.","[Mallick, Sushanta K.] Queen Mary Univ London, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Mallick, SK (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",s.k.mallick@qmul.ac.uk,,"Mallick, Sushanta/0000-0003-3851-3680",,,,,80,21,22,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Using the original Taylor rule, a modified Taylor rule with a higher output gap coefficient, and an estimated Taylor rule, we define rules-based and discretionary eras by smaller and larger policy rule deviations, the absolute value of the difference between the actual federal funds rate and the federal funds rate prescribed by the three rules. We use tests for multiple structural changes to identify the eras so that knowledge of subsequent economic outcomes cannot influence the choice of the dates. With the original Taylor rule, monetary policy in the U.S. is characterized by a rules-based era until 1974, a discretionary era from 1974 to 1985, a rules-based era from 1985 to 2000, and a discretionary era from 2001 to 2013. With the modified Taylor rule, the rules-based era extends further into the 1970s and there is an additional rules-based period starting in 2006. We calculate various loss functions and find that economic performance is uniformly better during rules-based eras than during discretionary eras, and that the original Taylor rule provides the largest loss during discretionary periods relative to loss during rules-based periods.

We specify the full set for sex-birth order composition of existing children using a split-population model. The model relaxes the assumption in conventional hazard models that all mothers would eventually have another child. Our results indicate a preference in these families for one male offspring. In addition, we observe a mixed sex preference at the fourth birth order. We also establish that a one-square-meter increase in household living area, as a proxy for the increment in household wealth, is associated with a 0.997 times lower preference for a son for the second childbirth, but a 1.015 and 1.014 times higher preference for a son for the third and fourth childbirths, respectively. As long as two-child families dominate the population structure, these results suggest that the importance placed on economic reasons for a son preference will gradually weaken as economic development proceeds in Vietnam.","Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Vu, TM (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",vmtien@gmail.com,"Vu, Tien Manh/K-5380-2012","Vu, Tien Manh/0000-0002-2251-0795",,,,,51,6,6,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Part of the education reform involves an allocation of additional funding of US$ 20 billion to a group of 112 universities to strengthen their research capabilities with an ultimate goal for them to become national catalysts for raising Chinese educational standards to world-class quality. The target university group is known as Project 211 universities. Other non-Project 211 universities have not received such resources. This paper is the first to provide rigorous assessment of the impact of the latest higher education reform on the performance of Chinese universities for the period 2007-2009. Evidence from meta-frontier analysis reveals that the reform had intended impact on the Chinese universities in our sample. Project 211 universities, on average, performed better than the non-Project 211 group and managerial inefficiency is the key attribute of low overall productive efficiency. Unlike Project 211 universities, non-Project 211 universities have limited access to the best available technology. However, the Malmquist productivity index suggests that Project 211 universities experienced more severe productivity regress than non-Project 211 universities. Our mixed evidence may reflect economy-wide conditions and warrant further research. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the higher education reforms should be broadened to allow non-Project 211 universities to compete with Project 211 universities for additional financial support required to enhance their research capability.

It identifies a type of equilibrium, called a Romer-Rosenthal equilibrium, in which in every period the bureaucrat proposes the maximum level of public investment the voter will support. The paper establishes that such an equilibrium exists for a variety of public good benefit functions. Equilibrium public good levels converge or almost converge to a steady state. These steady states can involve a unique public good level being provided each period or may exhibit a two period cycle. Steady state public good levels exceed the voter's optimal level. More surprisingly, steady state equilibrium reversion levels can exceed the voter's optimal steady state level, meaning that reversion levels cannot be used to bound the optimal level. Reflecting the inability of the agents to commit to their future proposing and voting behavior, equilibrium paths are Pareto inefficient. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we study the concealment of such correlation from a boundedly rational player. We show that strong players, i.e., players whose strategic complexity is less stringently bounded, can orchestrate the online correlation of the actions of weak players, where this correlation is concealed from an opponent of intermediate strength. The feasibility of such online concealed correlation is reflected in the individually rational payoff of the opponent and in the equilibrium payoffs of the repeated game. This result enables the derivation of a folk theorem that characterizes the set of equilibrium payoffs in a class of repeated games with boundedly rational players and a mechanism designer who sends public signals.

Covering the entire world and seven EU countries, WorldScan simulates economic growth in a neo-classical recursive dynamic framework, including emissions and abatement of greenhouse gases (CO2. N2O and CH4) and air pollutants (SO2, NOx, NH3 and PM2.5). Abatement includes the possibility of using end-of-pipe control options that remove pollutants without affecting the emission-producing activity itself. This paper analyses several variants of EU's air pollution policies for the year 2020. Air pollution policy will depend on end-of-pipe controls for not more than two thirds, thus also at least one third of the required emission reduction will come from changes in the use of energy through efficiency improvements, fuel switching and other structural changes in the economy. Greenhouse gas emissions thereby decrease, which renders climate change policies less costly. Our results show that carbon prites will fall, and may even drop to zero when the EU agrees on a more stringent air pollution policy. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This period was characterized by processes that are typical of economic transition in Central and Eastern Europe: large ownership restructuring and private sector liberalization and development, increasing trade openness, large inflows of foreign direct investment, and labor legislation reforms affecting employment protection. In addition to these changes, we control for economic conditions and the sectoral composition of employment with respect to the demographic characteristics of employees. Our results show that the share of fixed-term employees is higher in sectors with higher employment growth and a larger share of young and female workers, as well as in economic activities that are open to international trade. Sectors with a larger share of workers with a university degree have a smaller share of employees with fixed-term contracts. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no significant correlation between fixed-term employment share and ownership type (private, state owned, or entities in mixed ownership), including foreign ownership. We do not find any significant effects that could reliably be attributed to labor market legislation reform.","[Bratic, Vjekoslav; Vuksic, Goran] Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Vuksic, G (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia.",vjekoslav.bratic@ijf.hr; goran.vuksic@ijf.hr,"Bratic, Vjekoslav/A-7255-2016; Vuksic, Goran/A-7454-2016","Bratic, Vjekoslav/0000-0002-9295-0286; Vuksic, Goran/0000-0003-1502-5561",,,,,28,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We find that contribution decisions depend on the interaction of gender and the gender stereotype associated with the decision-making domain: conditional on measured ability, individuals are less willing to contribute ideas in areas that are stereotypically outside of their gender's domain. Importantly, these decisions are largely driven by self-assessments, rather than fear of discrimination. Individuals are less confident in gender-incongruent areas and are thus less willing to contribute their ideas. Because even very knowledgeable group members undercontribute in gender-incongruent categories, group performance suffers and, ex post, groups have difficulty recognizing who their most talented members are. Our results show that even in an environment where other group members show no bias, women in male-typed areas and men in female-typed areas may be less influential. An intervention that provides feedback about a woman's (man's) strength in a male-typed (female-typed) area does not significantly increase the probability that she contributes her ideas to the group. A back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that a lean in-style policy that increases contribution by women would significantly improve group performance in male-typed domains.","Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Coffman, KB (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,,,,,,32,98,129,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The equilibrium response of network investment to changes in the labor market conditions generates novel empirical predictions. In particular, the probability that a worker finds a new job via his connections increases in the separation rate when the separation rate is low, whereas it decreases when the separation rate is high.

Seventeen per cent of the respondents surveyed in 1984 died between 1984 and 2007. After controlling for initial health conditions, we find that people's life satisfaction at the beginning of the survey is deeply linked to their life expectancy: a ten per cent increase in life satisfaction is connected to a four per cent decline in the probability of death in the period studied. The relationship between life satisfaction and mortality is stronger for the married and the men but life satisfaction does not matter for the women. We find some suggestive evidence that links between life satisfaction and mortality could be operating via accidents and mental health. Finally, we show that the life satisfaction measured in 1984 extends to the rest of life: people who were happier in 1984 more frequently experienced high levels of happiness in the rest of their lives. These results suggest that life satisfaction is a powerful risk-factor for later mortality and is more predictive of mortality than a host of other variables.","[Guven, Cahit; Saloumidis, Rudy] Deakin Univ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Guven, C (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",cahit.guven@deakin.edu.au,,"Guven, Cahit/0000-0001-8346-772X",,,,,36,10,10,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

While there is growing evidence of the effect film piracy has on studio profits, the evidence on the impact of anti-piracy legislation is limited. If anti-piracy legislation is having the film industry's desired impact, we would expect film revenues to be consistently higher following the passage of major laws that restrict access to pirated content, or major enforcement actions, such as the shutdown of Web sites that provide illegal content for download. This paper applies an intervention analysis approach to weekly data on movie box-office revenues in the USA to determine whether the passage of new anti-piracy policy has generated significant changes in box-office revenues during the period from 1997 to the present. These effects are evaluated in both the short and long term, which allows an assessment of the duration of effectiveness of government actions. The results show that four of the six included policies are ineffective in the long term and those policies that do impact revenues in the short term often harm film studios, rather than help them.","Suffolk Univ, Boston, MA 02108 USA",Suffolk University,"Orme, T (通讯作者)，Suffolk Univ, 8 Ashburton Pl, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",teorme@suffolk.edu,,,,,,,11,15,16,1,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We measure sports sentiment by the performance of sports teams from the four major professional sports leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL) that are based nearby firms' headquarters. We find that concurrent stock returns and sports performances associated with the same locality are highly correlated. Consistent with the notion that mispricing is indeed caused by sports sentiment, we also determine that sentiment is related to a subsequent gradual return reversal, which occurs over the following three year period. In addition, we confirm that local comovement is more pronounced in the presence of sports sentiment in support of the view that local stock preference of relatively less sophisticated retail investors can be driven by factors that are not information-based. Finally, we devise investment strategies based on recent past observations of sports sentiment and find that they generate sizable abnormal returns, especially in cases of firms located in areas where fan base support appears to be stronger.

The paper shows first that the definition of well-being by each approach, which is a normative step, is revealed by the choice of a psychological theory or method rather than resulting from the application of a theory or method. Secondly, this paper demonstrates that personal judgement by the authors is often needed in the positive realm, in order to interpret psychological results and to then translate them into practical recommendations. Both of these issues have implications for those theories that define well-being as something other than the fulfillment of individual preferences whatever their content, and which therefore yield a potential justification for paternalism. This paper argues that the potential paternalistic implications of these approaches are not based on positive science only, but rely on normative choice and personal judgement.","Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Collewet, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, ROA, Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.collewet@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Collewet, Marion/HTT-2227-2023","Collewet, Marion/0000-0002-8289-847X",,,,,54,0,0,1,26,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 2,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201432,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-32,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AP9OL,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342409000001,0

The current study probes deeper into the height premium by focusing on the specific favorable traits, attributes, and abilities tall individuals are presumed to have, ultimately giving these individuals an advantage in hiring. In an experiment, we made a male job applicant taller or shorter by digitally manipulating photographs, and attached these to job applications that were evaluated by professional recruiters. We find that in the context of hiring a project leader, the height premium consists of increased perceptions of the candidate's general competence, specific job competency (including employability), and physical health, whereas warmth and physical attractiveness seem to matter less. Interestingly, physical height predicted recruiters' hiring intentions even when statistically controlling for competence, warmth, health, and attractiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

My earlier works suggested that dowry can be interpreted as a pre-mortem bequest by a woman's parents to help establish her position and safeguard her welfare in the new conjugal household. This hypothesis is, however, inconsistent with the dominant view in India, where inflating dowry is considered responsible for the plights of many women. Despite these divergent views, recent studies suggested that dowry is not a homogeneous transfer but a combination of different transactions. In this article, I use a survey data set from India to decompose the transfer into various components and identify their effects on the status of the wife. It is found that a larger transfer from the bride's parents to the bride will enhance her decision-making role. This suggests an outright ban on dowry may not necessarily serve the interest of Indian women.","Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Chan, W (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wchana@hku.hk,"Chan, William/A-4384-2010; chan, william/KCO-8196-2024",,,,,,39,11,11,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Once the government reaches its fiscal limit on ordinary taxation, it cannot turn to seigniorage for financing. We show that a monetary union country can increase its seigniorage revenue by reissuing its own currency even as it fully honors all outstanding debt obligations. We use a simple cash-in-advance model, with domestic currency demand motivated by the need to pay taxes, to show that this policy effectively redistributes seigniorage revenue away from other monetary union members toward the acting country. The magnitude of the seigniorage created by currency reissue is limited both by the relative size of the country and by money demand, and, therefore, by the tax base. If this seigniorage revenue is insufficient, some additional seigniorage is available by allowing the new currency to grow and depreciate over time and domestic real wages to fall.

However, economic theory is ambiguous on the price effects of vertical separation. In this paper, we empirically analyze the effect of ownership unbundling of gas transmission networks, considered to be the strongest form of vertical separation, on the level of end-user prices. Therefore, we apply different dynamic estimators such as system GMM and the bias-corrected least-squares dummy variable estimator to an unbalanced panel consisting of 18 EU countries over 19 years, allowing us to avoid the endogeneity problem and to estimate the long-run effects of regulation. We introduce a set of regulatory indicators as market entry regulation, ownership structure, vertical separation and market structure, as well as account for structural and economic country specifics. Among the different estimators, we consistently find that ownership unbundling has no impact on natural gas end-user prices, while the more modest legal unbundling reduces them significantly. Furthermore, third-party access, market structure and privatization show significant influence, with the latter leading to higher prices.","[Growitsch, Christian] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Stronzik, Marcus] Sci Inst Infrastruct & Commun Serv WIK, Dept Energy Markets & Energy Regulat, D-53604 Bad Honnef, Germany",University of Cologne,"Growitsch, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",christian.growitsch@uni-koeln.de; m.stronzik@wik.org,,,,,,,40,13,16,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

An exception is when the policy is owned by the beneficiaries and the insured gives up ownership and control, including the ability to change beneficiaries. Should the insured strategically own the policy contract and potentially subject proceeds to estate and inheritance taxes, or relinquish control, with the beneficiaries owning the policy, and escape such transfer taxes? This paper addresses how the estate tax influences the choice of life insurance ownership. Using samples of estate tax returns, the empirical evidence suggests that those facing high estate tax rates are more likely to forgo ownership and have proceeds excluded from their estates, and provides further evidence on the incentive effect of taxes and in support of the strategic bequest motive.

While the four policies all achieve the same goal, economic outcomes differ significantly. Options to curtail benefits encourage own savings and capital accumulation, while the payroll tax increase and the means-test reduce work effort.

Exploiting the newly published Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data, we are able to achieve a better estimation of the classical Duncan and Hoffman ORU model than previous papers by controlling for heterogeneity of observable skills. Our findings suggest that (i) a considerable part of the effect of educational mismatches can be attributed to skills heterogeneity, and (ii) that the extent to which skills explain educational mismatches varies by institutional contexts, particularly the extent to which collective wage bargaining is regulated. These observations suggest that skills matter for explaining wage effects of education and educational mismatches, but also that the extent to which this is the case depends on collective wage bargaining.","[Levels, Mark; van der Velden, Rolf; Allen, Jim] Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labor Market, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; Maastricht Univ, Coll Interdisciplinary Educ Res, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Levels, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Res Ctr Educ & Labor Market, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.levels@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,34,54,57,4,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The application of the refinement scheme proposed by Guerrieri et al. (2010) shows that there is no equilibrium with counterfeiting. However, due to the entry margin, counterfeiting poses a threat to the existence of a monetary equilibrium: there is no monetary equilibrium if the cost of producing counterfeits is low enough. Moreover, the threat of counterfeiting can generate an endogenous resalability constraint. An extension of the model is provided which allows the threat of counterfeiting to materialize, in that some buyers cannot observe the offers, and therefore search randomly.

They also estimate the global damage potential for each gas-the ratio of the social cost of the non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas to the social cost of carbon dioxide. For all gases, they find the social costs and damage potentials sensitive to alternative assumptions. The global damage potentials are compared to global warming potentials (GWPs), a key metric used to compare gases. The authors find that global damage potentials are higher than GWPs in nearly all sensitivities. This finding suggests that previous papers using GWPs may be underestimating the relative importance of reducing non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions from a climate damage perspective. Of particular interest is the sensitivity of results to carbon dioxide fertilization, which notably reduces the social cost of carbon dioxide, but only has a small effect on the other gases. As a result, the global damage potentials for methane and nitrous oxide are much higher with carbon dioxide fertilization included, and higher than many previous estimates.","[Waldhoff, Stephanie] Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Anthoff, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rose, Steven] Elect Power Res Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Tol, Richard S.

It is shown that the effect of internal enforcement on the wage rate in host firms depends on the attitude to risk of illegal immigrants and host firms. It is also shown that the impacts of the minimum wage legislation differ according to risk preference and the degree of labor employment elasticity to the source wage.

Annual data from 1970 to 2011, panel cointegration tests by Pedroni (1999), long ran panel causality tests by Canning and Pedroni (2008), and two-step System GMM by Blundell and Bond (1998) are used in this study. We find a negative relationship between oil rents and agriculture value added in the long run, with a rather slow rate of short run adjustment of agriculture value added back to equilibrium after a boom in oil rents. These results indicate that an oil sector boom is associated with a contraction in the agriculture sectors of the countries in the panel in the long run. This is probably attributable to a resource movement effect from other economic sectors to the booming oil sector in these countries. This serves as evidence of a Dutch disease effect of an oil sector boom on agriculture in the MENA countries in this study.

In this paper we use a Hotelling model with two regions that differ in technology to study the impact of patient mobility on health care quality, health care financing and welfare. We show that without patient mobility quality is too low (high) and too few (many) patients are treated in the high-skill (low-skill) region. The effects of patient mobility depend on the transfer payment. If the payment is below marginal cost, mobility leads to a 'race-to-the-bottom' in quality and lower welfare in both regions. If the payment is equal to marginal cost, quality and welfare remain unchanged in the high-skill region, but the low-skill region benefits. For a socially optimal payment, which is higher than marginal cost, quality levels in the two regions are closer to (but not at) the first best, but welfare is lower in the low-skill region. Thus, patient mobility can have adverse effects on quality provision and welfare unless an appropriate transfer payment scheme is implemented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Taking into account the possibility of self-insurance through saving, we find that provinces in China shared roughly 38% of their idiosyncratic output shocks during the entire sample period. In particular, we show that conventional risk-sharing analysis in the extant literature that does not take into account the self-insurance channel tends to over-estimate the degree of risk sharing by implying a degree of risk sharing of around 54%. Moreover, in view of the major economic reforms that had taken place in the last few decades, we decompose the sample period into two sub-phases: the pre-reform period (1952-1978), the reform period (1978-2008). We find that there is a notable increase in the degree of provincial risk sharing in the reform period. The degree of provincial risk sharing across China is comparable to that across the OECD countries, but falls short of that among the states in the US. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from Mexico and Canada, this paper decomposes these differences in terms of reduced form shocks that affect aggregate efficiency and distort the decisions of households about how much to invest, consume, and work in a standard model of a small open economy. The decomposition exercise suggests that most of these differences are explained by fluctuations in aggregate efficiency, distortions in labor choices over the business cycle, and distortions in intertemporal consumption choices. Successful models for emerging markets fluctuations should include primitive shocks and frictions that generate these features. Models with financial frictions in the form of working capital constraints, possibly augmented with endogenous collateral constraints, are consistent with these findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Regulators set tariffs according to a performance standard and, if the companies can outperform such a standard, they can retain the gains observed by such outperformance. Efficiency performance is usually assessed by comparison (or a benchmark) against either other companies or the company's own historical performance. This paper discusses the impact of environmental variables on the efficiency performance of electricity distribution companies. Indeed, such variables, which are argued to be unmanageable, may affect the electricity utilities' performance. Thus, this paper proposes a simulation methodology based on design of experiment philosophy for statistically testing environmental variables and the interactions among them, enabling regulators to build the best suited semi-parametric two-stage model of electricity utility benchmarking analysis. To demonstrate the power of the proposed approach, experimental simulations are carried out using real data published by Brazil's regulator. The results show that environmental variables may impact efficiency performance linearly and nonlinearly. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

We incorporate supermarket access into a utility-theoretic censored demand system for 13 food groups among households that receive the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in the U.S. The demand system is estimated with a Bayesian procedure which otherwise would have been cumbersome with the classical approach. Results suggest that prices are significant determinants of food purchases, but supermarket access has limited influence.

The existing literature may not appropriately evaluate the price elasticity and income elasticity of gasoline demand. Most studies fail to address the possible heterogeneity in gasoline demand elasticities that may arise from a variety of sources. The endogeneity issue of gasoline price has remained redundant throughout the literature. I address these challenges using a flexible demand model and a recently developed estimation technique. The econometric approach allows for functional coefficients to accommodate the heterogeneity in demand 'elasticities. Several instrumental variables are used to investigate the endogeneity of gasoline price. The estimation results provide strong evidence of heterogeneous gasoline demand elasticities across states and over time. Some state-level attributes along with income and macroeconomic shocks are the potential sources of heterogeneity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The theory is illustrated using educational stratification and its implications on the estimation of multilevel education production functions. Educational stratification results from the functioning of the education market; it transforms a continuum of student characteristics into a continuum of tuition fees. These fees enter students' utility functions and determine the school they attend and its quality. In other words, student characteristics are the major determinants of school quality and the two are correlated. In this paper, I analyze how these correlations arise and what their implications are formultilevel estimation of education production functions. The major problem posed by such correlations is cross-level endogeneity bias. The theory developed in this paper can be extended to any economic phenomenon that exhibits stratification or nesting of smaller units within larger units (employees within firms, residents within neighborhoods, etc.).","Univ London, Inst Educ, Ctr Longitudinal Studies, London WC1N 1AZ, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Mostafa, T (通讯作者)，Univ London, Inst Educ, Ctr Longitudinal Studies, London WC1N 1AZ, England.",t.mostafa@ioe.ac.uk,"Mostafa, Tarek/JAO-3535-2023","Mostafa, Tarek/0000-0002-8020-8359",,,,,24,0,0,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

I construct a model in which entrepreneurs cannot commit to repaying investors for the capital advanced, but investors can force repayment by spending resources. The principal uses enforcement to reduce the resources available to the agent after a default, thus providing incentives for the agent to stay in the relationship. She also ensures contract compliance by backloading the payments to the agent: expected utility rises over time, preventing a default. I consider an application of the framework developed in the paper to the area of firm dynamics. I show that enforcement and backloading are always used jointly. Firm size (measured by capital) grows with time and each firm converges to the efficient size. A second application is to the field of economic development. Costlier enforcement leads to the choice of sub-optimal technology; secondly, it leads to inefficient dispersion of capital across establishments.","Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Popov, L (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",lpopov@virginia.edu,,,,,,,34,6,6,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In order to address structural economic problems, unions agreed to moderate wage outcomes and to facilitate the transition to workplace bargaining in return for social welfare gains for workers, which successive governments have maintained. These reforms helped to improve labor market efficiency and allowed firms to integrate successfully into international markets, without substantially compromising the interests of workers and their families, which thereby allowed economic dislocation and social unrest to be contained. In contrast to the assertions of certain Australian employer groups, research has consistently shown that union involvement in workplace bargaining has a benign impact on business productivity. However, declining membership presents a significant challenge to the capacity of Australian unions to influence economic outcomes at the national and workplace levels in the future.","[Wright, Chris F.; Lansbury, Russell D.] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Wright, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",chris.f.wright@sydney.edu.au; russell.lansbury@sydney.edu.au,"Wright, Chris F/I-6873-2016","Wright, Chris F/0000-0003-0984-6208",,,,,52,13,13,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Applicants for disability benefits who are twice denied through the normal process can appeal to one of the Social Security Administration's administrative law judges, who hold appointed positions. The data for this study are taken from decisions made by approximately 1000 judges for cases heard from 2010 through 2012. Using each judge as a unit of observation, the data reveal the number of cases heard and the number of approvals granted. We augmented the data with additional information on the presiding judge, and with data from the state in which the court resides. The purpose of the study is to determine whether a simple model can explain, first, the volume of decisions rendered at the judge level and, second, the proportion of approvals. Results indicate that the volume of decisions can be explained in part by the judge's recent record of leniency. Evidence also supports the hypothesis that approval outcomes depend on judges' professional tenure and economic factors in the state of jurisdiction.","[Nakosteen, Robert] Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Zimmer, Michael] Univ Evansville, Schroeder Sch Business Adm, Evansville, IN 47722 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Evansville,"Nakosteen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Isenberg Sch Management, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",nakosteen@isenberg.umass.edu,,,,,,,15,0,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Fourth, the averages of total NJC and private NJC since late 2010 were significantly higher than their respective historical averages and the volatility in NJC since the end of the Great Recession was not unusual by historical standards. Fifth, while the evidence about the effects of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment is inconclusive, some sectors appeared to benefit from it.

The empirical analysis relies on exogenous indicators of regulation of Indian services sectors and detailed firm-level data from India in the 1994-2004 period. I find that the reform of upstream services sector has increased the probability of exporting and export sales shares of firms producing in downstream manufacturing industries. The results suggest that the effect of services liberalization on manufacturing firms' export performance is stronger for initially more productive firms. These empirical findings are robust to alternative econometric specifications that control for other reforms, industry, firm characteristics and that deal with potential reverse causality concerns.

The appreciation of the euro has a negative impact on exports and a positive effect on imports, confirming the fears of European politicians and managers in the aeronautic sector. The gravity equation, extended to integrate factor complementarities among partners, also shows that labor productivity levels in France and its partner countries are significant determinants of trade, supporting O-ring theory applied from Kremer (1993) to-explicate trade in the aeronautical sector. The spatial organization of this sector is also analyzed via the impact of foreign military spending on French trade. Finally, by distinguishing French imports and arrivals of products manufactured in Europe and in France, supplementary estimations reveal that outward foreign direct investment FDI affects the imports and arrivals of European products negatively but has positive influences on the imports and arrivals of French products.

However, due to their public nature, these mechanisms are not without problems. The literature shows the presence of free riding and socially inefficient contribution levels. This paper experimentally tests the effect of cultural and historical information pertaining to heritage houses in Penang, Malaysia, on public contributions for their conservation. This paper considers a standard linear one-shot four-person public good game and the decision of the subjects being to contribute either to a private or to a public account. We devise 4 treatments: a Control treatment, a treatment where subjects are provided with cultural and historical information pertaining to the heritage houses, a treatment that includes a contribution threshold, and finally a treatment that combines the use of cultural and historical information with the contribution threshold. The main finding shows that 60-75 % of the subjects contributed more than what they believed others in the same group would contribute when they were provided with the pertinent cultural and historical information. Most of the subjects contributed less than their belief, while 75-77 % cooperated 'selfishly' in treatments without the information. These findings are in agreement with the literature, namely that contributions are higher in treatments with a contribution threshold. Moreover, the combination of a contribution threshold and cultural information could encourage more pro-social behaviours.","[Ch'ng, Kean Siang; Chin, Phaik Nie] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, George Town, Malaysia; [Khoo, Suet Leng] Univ Sains Malaysia, Dev Planning & Management Dept, Sch Social Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Chin, PN (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, George Town, Malaysia.",cks@usm.my; slkhoo@usm.my; phaikniechin@gmail.com,"Kean-Siang, Ch'ng/A-6914-2010; Khoo, Suet Leng/E-2069-2012; Chin, Phaik Nie/N-7833-2017","Chng, Kean Siang/0000-0003-2154-5715; Chin, Phaik Nie/0000-0002-2315-8295",,,,,40,1,1,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The data used covers all Peruvian exporting firms between 2002 and 2008, a period during which Peru was active in joining the global economy. This is done using two indices, one that summarizes the tariffs faced by exporters, the other that measures the preferential margin at the bilateral level. Results show that more than market access conditions per se, it is market access conditions relative to those faced by competitors that significantly influences export performance and survival. About a fifth of the increase of exports directed to Mercosur countries is due to improvement in preference margins.","[Fugazza, Marco] United Nations Conf Trade & Dev UNCTAD, CH-1210 Geneva 11, Switzerland; [McLaren, Alain] Univ Geneva, Dept Econ Polit, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Fugazza, M (通讯作者)，United Nations Conf Trade & Dev UNCTAD, CH-1210 Geneva 11, Switzerland.",marco.fugazza@unctad.org; alain.mclaren@unige.ch,,,,,,,45,17,18,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

After the collapse of communism c. 1990, preferences for redistribution did not decrease by 2000, and if anything, they increased. One explanation is the so-called public values effect: individual beliefs shape preferences for redistribution. East Europeans continue to believe that it is the responsibility of the state to provide for the poor, and hence, they prefer redistribution. Income and expected income also affect preferences for redistribution but to a lesser degree than relative income and income history.

Contextual factors made it possible to explain 79% of the difference between schools. The raw average and value-added (random effect at the school level) produced contrasting evaluations in 34% of cases; and the average was more stable (r = 0.8) than value-added (r = 0.5) in both years. Various shortcomings in the ENEM as an indicator of school effectiveness were identified.

We establish an asymmetric information model to analyze why certain firms use private bank loans while others use public bonds to finance foreign production. The hidden information is the productivity shock to FDI. Banks are willing to monitor the risk of FDI, while bondholders are not; hence, banks act as a costly middleman that enables firms to avoid excessive risk. We show that firms' productivity levels, the riskiness of FDI, and the relative costs of bank finance and bond finance are three key determinants of the firm's financing choice. Countries with higher productivity, higher bank costs, or investment in less risky destinations, use more bond finance than bank finance. These results are supported by evidence from OECD countries.

Two rationales are usually provided for the finding that women tend to be relatively more satisfied with their jobs than men although disadvantaged in labour markets: first, women may have relatively lower expectations of career and income, and second, they may attach relatively less importance to extrinsic rewards than men. In order to analyse whether substantial gender differences exist already at the beginning of the career, we employ information of over 20 000 graduates collected through a large-scale survey of German university graduates who recently entered the labour market. We find that the job satisfaction of female graduates is on average slightly lower than the job satisfaction of male graduates, but our results do not point to substantial gender differences. In our sample of highly qualified individuals, men and women are very similar in what they want from their jobs and also in their perceptions of what they get. While our results point to substantial similarity of men and women in the early career stage, gender differences may emerge at later stages of the career life cycle.","[Boente, Werner] Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany; [Krabel, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Inst Econ, D-34109 Kassel, Germany",University of Wuppertal; Universitat Kassel,"Bönte, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",boente@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,"Bonte, Werner/0000-0002-2923-5423",,,,,36,11,20,1,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To achieve that, an extension of the Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) dynamic spillover index based on structural decomposition is employed. The results reveal that economic policy uncertainty (oil price shocks) responds negatively to aggregate demand oil price shocks (economic policy uncertainty shocks). Furthermore, during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, total spillovers increase considerably, reaching unprecedented heights. Moreover, in net terms, economic policy uncertainty becomes the dominant transmitter of shocks between 1997 and 2009, while in the post-2009 period there is a significant role for supply-side and oil specific demand shocks, as net transmitters of spillover effects. These results are important for policy makers, as well as, investors interested in the oil market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Are the resulting trade cost reductions a force for the diffusion of industrial and total economic activity to peripheral regions, or do they reinforce the concentration of production in space? This article exploits China's National Trunk Highway System as a large-scale natural experiment to contribute to our understanding of this question. The network was designed to connect provincial capitals and cities with an urban population above 500,000. As a side effect, a large number of small peripheral counties were connected to large metropolitan agglomerations. To address non-random route placements on the way between targeted city nodes, I propose an instrumental variable strategy based on the construction of least cost path spanning tree networks. The estimation results suggest that network connections have led to a reduction in GDP growth among non-targeted peripheral counties. This effect appears to be driven by a significant reduction in industrial output growth. Additional results present evidence in support of a trade-based channel in the light of falling trade costs between peripheral and metropolitan regions.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Faber, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,413,500,56,386,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In spite of the substantial size and growth of this segment recently, the role of Islamic banking in the economy is still heavily debated and very few empirical work is available. This paper studies the empirical impact of Islamic banking on banking sector development. It circumvents the lack of data through a newly constructed and comprehensive database, IFIRST, covering Islamic commercial banks worldwide over the period 2000-2005. This database is, to our knowledge, unique in the industry. We find strong and consistent empirical evidence that the development of Islamic banking in Muslim countries leads to a higher banking sector development, as measured by the amount of private credit or bank deposits scaled to GDP. This effect occurs through the development of a new, Shariah-compliant, banking industry, which does not crowd out the conventional banking system. Additionally, we provide evidence that the Islamic banking sector acts as a complement to the conventional banking in Muslim countries, when both systems co-exist and the Islamic sector reaches a medium penetration in the total banking sector.

The main hurdle in this literature is identifying the exogenous impact in the absence of student sorting by gender. This article addresses this difficulty by using institutional data from a private liberal arts institution to examine outcomes for students in courses taught by new faculty members for which the students would not know the gender before registering. Results provide evidence of a role model effect for both genders; students earn higher grades in courses taught by same-gender instructors in fields traditionally dominated by the opposite gender. Major choice and course-taking behavior are mostly unaffected by,faculty gender.","Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA",Wake Forest University,"Griffith, AL (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7505, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",griffial@wfu.edu,,,,,,,16,18,29,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

First, we propose a more efficient implementation of the Smolyak method for interpolation, namely, we show how to avoid costly evaluations of repeated basis functions in the conventional Smolyak formula. Second, we extend the Smolyak method to include anisotropic constructions that allow us to target higher quality of approximation in some dimensions than in others. Third, we show how to effectively adapt the Smolyak hypercube to a solution domain of a given economic model. Finally, we argue that in large-scale economic applications, a solution algorithm based on Smolyak interpolation has substantially lower expense when it uses derivative-free fixed-point iteration instead of standard time iteration. In the context of one- and multi-agent optimal growth models, we find that the proposed modifications to the conventional Smolyak method lead to substantial increases in accuracy and speed.

With the aim of understanding why a government would pursue such a policy in the current context of persistent economic recession, this article traces the social, political and economic developments that have together shaped the evolution of ideas about austerity, from the earliest theorising by the classical political economists some 300 years ago. Throughout the historical narrative, important analytical themes revolve around the arguments used to justify austerity-notably appeals to ethics and morality (reinforced by misleading analogies drawn between government budgets and the accounts of firms and households). These include concerns about inflation and the observed relationship between inflation and unemployment; 'Ricardian equivalence' and 'non-Keynesian' effects of austerity; and the correlation between public debt levels and economic growth. The class analytics of austerity-who bears the burden of austerity and who benefits-and the process by which alternative ideas penetrate the mainstream and reconstitute the conventional wisdom are also important analytical themes.","[Konzelmann, Suzanne J.] Univ London, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London,"Konzelmann, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",s.konzelmann@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,132,70,76,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Controlling for country, time and firm characteristics, lower microcredit market concentration is associated with firms reporting financing as a more severe obstacle to their operations. This indicates that rising competition between microfinance institutions may have led to reduced financial access.

The authors consider that the merging firms decide their production strategy knowing the actual value of the production cost, while outsiders are a priori uncertain about the exact amount of cost efficiency/inefficiency that will result from the merger. Nevertheless, the key element of the model is that the merged entity can signal its own cost to some rivals (outsider-followers) when it behaves as a leader; while all outsiders remain uninformed when it behaves as a follower. They show that when there is role redistribution, the merging firms always have incentives to merge, irrespective of cost uncertainty, while a merger without role redistribution is ex ante profitable if and only if uncertainty is sufficiently great. As regards the social desirability of mergers, it is found that a merger between leaders always enhances welfare if participants have incentives to merge, such that private and collective interests coincide. Nevertheless, a merger with role redistribution leads to conflict between private and collective interests.","[Le Pape, Nicolas] Univ Caen, CREM, F-14032 Caen, France; [Zhao, Kai] Huaqiao Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Universite de Caen Normandie; Huaqiao University,"Zhao, K (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",nicolas.lepape@unicaen.fr; kai.zhao@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,12,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 16,2014,8.0,,,,,,,,201423,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2014-23,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AM1MY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000339611600001,0

Evoked constantly in politics and intellectual debates, the revolutionary past is still controversial this keeps historians from stepping back from the subject under study.

Critics express concern that grade inflation erodes incentives for students to learn; gives students, employers, and graduate schools poor information on absolute and relative abilities; and reflects the quid pro quo of grades for better student evaluations of professors. This paper evaluates an anti-grade-inflation policy that capped most course averages at a B+. The cap was biding for high-grading departments (in the humanities and social sciences) and was not binding for low-grading departments (in economics and sciences), facilitating a difference-in-differences analysis. Professors complied with the policy by reducing compression at the top of the grade distribution. It had little effect on receipt of top honors, but affected receipt of magna cum laude. In departments affected by the cap, the policy expanded racial gaps in grades, reduced enrollments and majors, and lowered student ratings of professors.","[Butcher, Kristin F.; McEwan, Patrick J.; Weerapana, Akila] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Butcher, Kristin F.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Butcher, KF (通讯作者)，Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA.",kbutcher@wellesley.edu,"McEwan, Patrick J./G-4547-2012",,,,,,15,38,58,3,21,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The semi-analytical expressions for conditional default probability, cumulative loss distribution function and expected tranche loss are explicitly derived in the G-VG copula models under large homogeneous portfolio approximation. Thus the CDO price can be determined. The numerical analysis is carried out and the properties of the new models with those of the traditional models are compared.

The mechanism links the n problems together because decisions and transfers are based on the whole vector of valuations of the agents. In particular, the decision on whether or not to provide a public good depends not only on the valuations of the agents for that good but, in some cases, also on the valuations for the other goods reported by the low-valuation agents. For the two-agent case, we show that the mechanism is asymptotically efficient and we provide an example that compares its relative efficiency with optimal separate provision and with another asymptotically efficient mechanism in the literature.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Galavotti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",sgalavotti@unipd.it,"Galavotti, Stefano/AAI-4503-2021",,,,,,24,0,0,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

To understand this behavior, we examine voluntary provision of a discrete public good with independent private values that can be ascertained at a cost. We find that an individual who considers a smaller contribution is less likely to learn her value, and thus the percentage of informed giving diminishes as the population grows. We also find that a direct grant to the charity exacerbates crowding-out by discouraging information acquisition whereas a matching grant increases donations by encouraging it. We further show that with costly information, a (first-order) stochastic increase in values can decrease donations; and that facilitating private acquisition of information can be a better fund-raising strategy than directly supplying it.

The aim of this article is to explore another possibility: to relate country's human capital to its outcome in TIMSS (The Third International Mathematics and Science Study),. large international study of students' achievements in mathematics and science literacy from 1995. The relationship between TIMSS scores and GDP growth during 2000-2010 and GDP per capita in 2010 is examined and TIMSS are compared with other proxies of human capital, namely primary, secondary and tertiary school-enrollment rates from 1990, 1995 and 2000. The main result is that the correlation between TIMSS scores and GDP per capita in 2010 is statistically significant at alpha = 0.01 level, and this relationship is stronger than that for school-enrollment rates. Also, linear models explaining GDP growth with TIMSS were found more statistically significant than models without TIMSS. These results indicate that TIMSS scores might be considered a suitable proxy for nations' human capital after one or one and a half decade.","Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Mazurek, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",mazurek@opfslu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019","Mazurek, Jiri/0000-0002-7965-0457",,,,,18,0,0,3,19,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

While the current studies show that taking non-attendance into account can significantly influence survey results, it is not yet clear what motivates respondents to ignore or pay less attention to some of the attributes. In the present study, we use 16 different split samples designed according to a design of designs plan, varying different aspects of dimensionality, i.e., the number of choice sets, the number of alternatives, or the number of attributes. Firstly, to analyse the relationship between stated attribute non-attendance and the design dimensions we test whether both are significantly associated. Secondly, we estimate equality-constrained latent class models with classes based on pre-defined rules to infer attribute non-attendance and analyse the influence of the design dimensions. Overall, the results indicate a rather weak relationship between stated or inferred attribute non-attendance and design dimensions.

The instruments we employ consist of two institutional changes in China that generated discontinuities in educational attainment among individuals. To ensure the validity of the instruments and obtain prudent conclusions, we adopt more restrictive identification tests than previous studies. The results indicate no causal impact of education on either perceived health or anthropometric health. With regard to the impact of education on male health behavior, namely smoking, we cannot provide conclusive results due to a violation of the exogeneity of our instruments. Nevertheless, we can confirm that education has no causal effect on female health behavior. To overcome the widely documented shortage of quasi-experimental identification, we also employ spouse's education as an alternative instrument to examine the causal effect of education. Identical results are obtained, with the exception that the impact of education on the reduction of overweight among women becomes significant. We conclude that this provides some evidence of a causal impact of education on health. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The analytical part of the article surveys the vast literature devoted to franchising and dual distribution. From this framework, several testable propositions linking network performance to organizational choices are derived. Three complementary criteria of performance are taken into account: the internationalization rate, the expansion rate and the market share. This article provides evidence for the simultaneity between these performance criteria, analytically related as indicators of the network commercial performance. Thus, the econometrical model is defined as a system of simultaneous equations, free of endogeneity regarding the explanatory variables. The estimations on recent French data obtained using the three-stage least squares method provide robust results and show that the type of distribution network, the number of company-owned outlets in the network, the type of sector and the choice to manage several networks simultaneously affect the performance.","[Fadairo, Muriel; Lanchimba, Cintya] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Fadairo, Muriel; Lanchimba, Cintya] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Fadairo, Muriel; Lanchimba, Cintya] Univ St Etienne, F-42000 St Etienne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Jean Monnet,"Fadairo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France.",muriel.fadairo@univ-st-etienne.fr,"Lanchimba, Cintya/U-5725-2018","Lanchimba, Cintya/0000-0003-2837-9107",,,,,50,8,8,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Results provide no evidence against the exogeneity of restricted windfall income and indicate that the causal effect of income on life satisfaction is substantially higher (and willingness-to-pay estimates substantially lower) when restricted windfall income is used. Further research should be devoted to looking into the presence and size of measurement errors in restricted windfall income. If this bias is large, then the quest for valid and strong instruments will continue. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
