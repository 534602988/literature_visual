Using a unique data set from Ghana with comprehensive information on individual, family, community, school quality characteristics and a direct measure of intelligence together with test scores, we examine the long-term cognitive effects of the 1983 famine on survivors. We show that differences in intelligence test scores can be robustly explained by the differential impact of the famine in different parts of the country and the impacts are most severe for children under two years of age during the famine. We also account for model uncertainty by using Bayesian Model Averaging. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

One reason is that consumers differ in their tastes and needs, which they can express most easily through their own choices. Elements that strengthen consumer choice feature prominently in the design of public insurance markets, for instance in the United States in the recent introduction of prescription drug coverage for older individuals via Medicare Part D. For policy makers who design such a market, an important practical question in the design phase of such a new program is how to deduce enrollment and plan selection preferences prior to its introduction. In this paper, we investigate whether hypothetical choice experiments can serve as a tool in this process. We combine data from hypothetical and real plan choices, elicited around the time of the introduction of Medicare Part D. We first analyze how well the hypothetical choice data predict willingness to pay and market shares at the aggregate level. We then analyze predictions at the individual level, in particular how insurance demand varies with observable characteristics. We also explore whether the extent of adverse selection can be predicted using hypothetical choice data alone. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Decisions are based on a variety of factors including the proportion infected, the likelihood of safe sex, the rate of detection and treatment, the cost of infection, and the length of search. The model demonstrates how directed search induces a separating equilibrium and, as a result, supports empirical evidence demonstrating the importance of sero-sorting. Furthermore, the model reinforces arguments that decreasing the costs of infection increases the infection rate. The model is calibrated, and the policy implications are analyzed within the context of men who have sex with men.

This involves determining the optimal trajectories of consumption in the local area and the use of the environmental resource. Economic dynamics are affected by negative environmental externalities which are explicitly included as unfavourable effects in a linear production function. The analysis shows the existence of local and global indeterminacy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The test is based on a new automatic selection of the order for a Box-Pierce (1970) test statistic or the test statistic of Hong (1996). The heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) critical values from Lee (2007) are used, allowing for estimation of the error term. The data-driven order selection is tailored to detect a new class of alternatives with autocorrelation coefficients which can be o(n(-1/2)) provided there are sufficiently many of such coefficients. A simulation experiment illustrates the good statistical properties of the test both under the weak white noise null and the alternative. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The period of rapid HIV decline coincided with a dramatic rise in girls' secondary school enrollment. We instrument for this enrollment with distance to school, conditional on a rich set of demographic and locational controls, including distance to market center. We find that girls' enrollment in secondary education significantly increased the likelihood of abstaining from sex. Using a triple-difference estimator, we find that some of the schooling increase among young women was in response to a 1990 affirmative action policy giving women an advantage over men on University applications.

Simple, robust and powerful tests of the breaking trend hypothesis. Econometric Theory 25, 995-1029] develop a test for the presence of a broken linear trend at an unknown point in the sample whose size is asymptotically robust as to whether the (unknown) order of integration of the data is either zero or one. This test is not size controlled, however, when this order assumes fractional values; its asymptotic size can be either zero or one in such cases. In this paper we suggest a new test, based on a sup-Wald statistic, which is asymptotically size-robust across fractional values of the order of integration (including zero or one). We examine the asymptotic power of the test under a local trend break alternative. The finite sample properties of the test are also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates health-related external benefits using a stated-preference discrete-choice experiment framed in a health care context and including choice scenarios defined by six attributes related to a recipient and the recipient's condition: communicability, severity, medical necessity, relationship to respondent, location, and amount of contribution requested. Subjects also completed a set of own-treatment scenarios and a values-orientation instrument. We find evidence of substantial health-related external benefits that vary as expected with the scenario attributes and subjects' value orientations. The results are consistent with a number of hypotheses offered by the general theoretical analysis of health-related externalities and the analysis of externalities specific to health care.

Secondary objectives related to assessing the cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants stratified by center-specific time in therapeutic range, age, and CHADS2 score. Methods: Cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Analysis used a Markov cohort model that followed patients from initiation of pharmacotherapy to death. Transition probabilities were obtained from a concurrent network meta-analysis. Utility values and costs were obtained from published data. Numerous deterministic sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analysis were conducted. Results: The incremental cost per QALY gained for dabigatran 150 mg versus warfarin was $20,797. Apixaban produced equal QALYs at a higher cost. Dabigatran 110 mg and rivaroxaban were dominated by dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban. Results were sensitive to the drug costs of apixaban, the time horizon adopted, and the consequences from major and minor bleeds with dabigatran. Results varied by a center's average time in therapeutic range, a patient's CHADS2 score, and patient age, with either dabigatran 150 mg or apixaban being optimal. Conclusions: Results were highly sensitive to patient characteristics. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110 mg were unlikely to be cost-effective. For different characteristics, apixaban or dabigatran 150 mg were optimal. Thus, the choice between these two options may come down to the price of apixaban and further evidence on the impact of major and minor bleeds with dabigatran.","[Coyle, Doug; Cameron, Chris; Kelly, Shannon; Wells, George A.] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada; [Coyle, Doug; Coyle, Kathryn] Appl Hlth Econ Res Unit, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Cameron, Chris; Kelly, Shannon; Wells, George A.] Univ Ottawa, Inst Heart, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada; [Lee, Karen] Canadian Agcy Drugs & Technol Hlth Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Steiner, Sabine] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Internal Med 2, Div Angiol, Vienna, Austria",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute; Medical University of Vienna,"Wells, GA (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Inst Heart, Cardiovasc Res Methods Ctr, 40 Ruskin St, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada.",gawells@ottawaheart.ca,"Steiner, Sabine/AAG-5804-2021; MUÑOZ, ROSA ANA/H-3964-2018","Steiner, Sabine/0000-0002-5680-1072; Coyle, Doug/0000-0003-3492-2268; Kelly, Shannon/0000-0002-5520-6095",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) - Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN),Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) - Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This study was funded through a team grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) - Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN).

Using longitudinal lifetime records of Union Army veterans, I first estimate that exposure to a malarial environment in early life (c.1840) substantially increased the likelihood of having various chronic diseases and not working in old age (c.1900). Second, from data on US cohorts born between 1891 and 1960,1 find that those exposed to a higher level of the anti-malaria campaign, which began in 1921, had lower levels of work disability in old age. Third, I seek the same implications for the modern period by linking WHO's country statistics on DALYs among older populations in 2004 to country-level malaria risk in pre-eradication era. In the paper, I discuss possible mechanisms and propose the significance of malaria eradication and early-life conditions from a long-term perspective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The GEL method is considered to be an extension of the generalized method of moments (GMM). The multivariate stable distributions are widely applicable as they can accommodate both skewness and heavy tails. We treat the spectral measure, which summarizes scale and asymmetry, by discretization. In order to estimate all the model parameters simultaneously, we apply the estimating function constructed by equating empirical and theoretical characteristic functions. The efficacy of the proposed GEL method is demonstrated in Monte Carlo studies. An illustrative example involving daily returns of market indexes is also included. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This support is striking because nursing education is clearly general, clearly paid by the firm, and information asymmetries appear minimal. Using AHA and survey data, I find hospitals employing a greater share of their MSA's registered nurses are more likely to provide direct financial support to nursing schools and faculty, net of size and other institutional controls. Given the institutional context, I interpret this result as unusually specific evidence that technologically general skill training may be made de facto-specific by imperfect and costly mobility.

Yet its benefits are still denied to many people worldwide. This article describes how many countries, both developed and developing, have pursued the quest to achieve universal health care. This has been an explicitly political process. In Europe, it emerged from a belief in solidarity, a fear of revolution, and a changing view of the role of the state. In developing countries, progress was more erratic, characterized by debates about the affordability of universal health care, until it was realized that functioning health systems were essential to deliver development goals. Throughout, the United States has been an exception. An analysis of progress toward universal health care, combining a review of existing theories and new empirical analysis, identifies five factors as important: the strength of organized labor and left-wing parties, adequate economic resources, absence of societal divisions, weakness of institutions that might oppose it (such as organized medicine), and windows of opportunity. Having noted the substantial benefits accruing from universal health care, the article concludes with an analysis of how universal health care is under threat in some European countries and a warning about the risks posed by current radical austerity policies.","[McKee, Martin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Serv Res Unit, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Balabanova, Dina] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Basu, Sanjay] Stanford, Stanford Prevent Res Ctr, Dept Med, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Ricciardi, Walter] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy; [Stuckler, David] Univ Cambridge, London, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Stanford University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Cambridge,"McKee, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Serv Res Unit, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",Martin.mckee@lshtm.ac.uk,"Stuckler, David/H-2261-2012; Ricciardi, Walter/AAB-2056-2019; McKee, Martin/E-6673-2018; Ricciardi, Walter/K-3342-2018; McKee, Marc D/E-2187-2011","Ricciardi, Walter/0000-0002-5655-688X; McKee, Martin/0000-0002-0121-9683; McKee, Marc D/0000-0001-8349-965X; Stuckler, David/0000-0002-1288-8401; Balabanova, Dina/0000-0001-7163-3428",,,,,52,83,85,0,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2013,16,1.0,,S,,,S39,S45,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.10.001,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,071JB,23317643.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313587500008,0

This reflects the assumption that a QALY is a QALY no matter who receives it, or the equity notion that all QALY gains are equally valuable, regardless of the context in which they are realized. If such an assumption does not adequately reflect the distributional concerns in society, however, different thresholds could be used for different QALY gains, whose relative values can be seen as equity weights. Aim: Our aim was to explore the relationship between equity or distributional concerns and the social value of QALYs within the health economics literature. In light of the empirical interest in equity-related concerns as well as the nature and height of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold, this study investigates the common ground between the two streams of literature and considers how the empirical literature estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold treats existing distributional considerations.","[Bobinac, Ana] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, iBMG iMTA, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bobinac, Ana] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Bobinac, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, iBMG iMTA, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bobinac@bmg.eur.nl,"van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013; Bobinac, Ana/ABE-8124-2021; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Bobinac, Ana/AAF-6113-2021","van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777; Bobinac, Ana/0000-0001-8798-9795; Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397;",Astra-Zeneca; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen-Cilag; Merck; Pfizer BV,Astra-Zeneca(AstraZeneca); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Janssen-Cilag(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Merck(Merck & Company); Pfizer BV,"Source of financial support: This study was part of a larger project investigating the broader societal benefits of health care, which was financially supported by Astra-Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen-Cilag, Merck, and Pfizer BV.

We apply our methodology to estimate households' willingness to pay (WTP) for reductions in asthma morbidity. Methods: By using a combination of focus groups, revealed preference surveys, and epidemiological surveys, we gathered information on health status, attitudes, and beliefs regarding asthma, risk-averting behaviors, perceptions of these behaviors, and household socioeconomic characteristics. We used this information to design a CV survey that we extensively tested for validity. In the survey, we elicited participants' WTP for a hypothetical device that would reduce symptom-days by improving asthma management; these data enabled us to estimate household WTP by using a variety of econometric models. Results: Our analysis of households with children with asthma yielded the following conclusions: the scenario should address both physical asthma symptoms and the psychosocial stress of managing a chronic illness; the survey should measure household perceptions of the burden of asthma in addition to objective measures such as symptom-days; and the scenario should not involve substantial behavioral changes or a new medication, to avoid confounding household preferences with unrelated attributes of the scenario. Our primary models estimated mean household WTP for a 50% reduction in symptom-days (and accompanying reductions in psychosocial stress) at $56.48 to $64.84 per month. Conclusions: Our methodology can be used to inform CV studies of chronic illness. Our WTP estimates can help regulatory agencies assess a wide range of policies that affect the incidence or severity of asthma.","[Brandt, Sylvia] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Vasquez Lavin, Felipe] Univ Desarrollo, Sch Business & Econ, Concepcion, Chile; [Hanemann, Michael] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Prof & Julie A Wrigley Chair Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Universidad del Desarrollo; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Brandt, S (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 205A Stockbridge Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",sylvbrandt@gmail.com,"Lavin, Felipe/AAF-7373-2020","Vasquez Lavin, Felipe/0000-0002-0767-998X",US EPA-STAR Valuation of Human Health Program [R-82966501]; project FONDECYT [11090005],US EPA-STAR Valuation of Human Health Program; project FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),"Source of financial support: This research was funded through the US EPA-STAR Valuation of Human Health Program (R-82966501, Valuing Reduced Asthma Morbidity in Children).

Personalized medicine technologies, however, do not neatly fit into existing health technology assessment and reimbursement processes. Objectives: In this article, the Personalized Medicine Special Interest Group of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research evaluated key development and reimbursement considerations from the payer and manufacturer perspectives. Methods: Five key areas in which health economics and outcomes research best practices could be developed to improve value assessment, reimbursement, and patient access decisions for personalized medicine have been identified. Results: These areas are as follows: 1 research prioritization and early value assessment, 2 best practices for clinical evidence development, 3 best practices for health economic assessment, 4 addressing health technology assessment challenges, and 5 new incentive and reimbursement approaches for personalized medicine. Conclusions: Key gaps in health economics and outcomes research best practices, decision standards, and value assessment processes are also discussed, along with next steps for evolving health economics and outcomes research practices in personalized medicine.","[Faulkner, Eric] Quintiles Global Consulting, Global Market Access, Durham, NC USA; [Faulkner, Eric] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Faulkner, Eric] Natl Assoc Managed Care Physicians, Glen Allen, VA USA; [Faulkner, Eric] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Annemans, Leven] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Garrison, Lou; Veenstra, David] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Helfand, Mark] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Holtorf, Anke-Peggy] Hlth Outcomes Strategies, Basel, Switzerland; [Hornberger, John] Cedar Associates, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Hornberger, John] Stanford Univ, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Hughes, Dyfrig] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Li, Tracy] Daiichi Sankyo, Princeton, NJ USA; [Malone, Daniel] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Siebert, Uwe] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe] ONCOTYROL Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Inssbruck, Austria; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Watkins, John] Premera Blue Cross, Mountlake Terrace, WA USA","IQVIA; Research Triangle Institute; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Ghent University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Oregon Health & Science University; Stanford University; Bangor University; Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited; University of Arizona; University of Manchester; UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Methods: Development of the SOBDA questionnaire consisted of three components. First, focus groups of patients with COPD were asked to describe their experiences of SOB with daily activities. A pool of items was drafted on the basis of information from the focus groups and literature reviews, and then discussed among instrument development and clinical experts. Cognitive debriefing interviews of patients were conducted to assess the draft item pool, and their feedback was used to develop newer versions of the questionnaire. Input was also sought from the Food and Drug Administration, patients, and clinicians. Results: Forty patients participated in seven focus groups. The terms most often used to describe SOB were short of breath or difficulty breathing. Patients were clearly able to distinguish SOB from chest congestion and wheezing, other common symptoms associated with COPD. The resulting item pool contained 37 items to assess SOB associated with everyday activities, and concept saturation was reached. Thirty-seven patients participated in the subsequent cognitive debriefing interviews. Patients found the items clear and easy to understand with relevance to their everyday experiences, and easy to use in an electronic format. Conclusions: Instructions and response options to the SOBDA questionnaire were well understood by patients with COPD, and item relevance was confirmed. Prospective validation and item reduction studies are highly anticipated.","[Howard, Kellee; Roberts, Laurie; Wilcox, Teresa] United BioSource Corp, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Berry, Pamela] GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, England; [Petrillo, Jennifer] Novartis Pharmaceut, Easton Hanover, NJ USA; [Wiklund, Ingela] United BioSource Corp, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res, London, England; [Watkins, Michael; Crim, Courtney] GlaxoSmithKline, Durham, NC USA",United Biosource Corporation; GlaxoSmithKline; Novartis; United Biosource Corporation; GlaxoSmithKline,"Wilcox, T (通讯作者)，United BioSource Corp, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",teresa.wilcox@unitedbiosource.com,,"Berry, Pamela/0000-0002-0677-8599",GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),Source of financial support: Funding for this research was provided by GlaxoSmithKline.

This propensity is shown using a dual decision approach where choices reflect the interaction of a deliberative system, operating as in standard economic models, and an affective system that responds rapidly to stimuli without considering long-term consequences. This framework is characterized by excess food consumption and body weight, in that individuals prefer both ex-ante and ex-post to eat and weigh less than they actually do, with weight loss attempts being common but often unsuccessful or only partially successful. As in the standard model, weight is related to prices. However, another potentially important reason for rising obesity is that food producers have incentives to engineer products to stimulate the affective system so as to encourage overeating. Data from several sources are used to investigate predictions of the dual decision model, with the evidence providing broad support for at least some irrationality in food consumption. Most importantly, there is little indication that the large secular increases in body mass index have been accompanied by corresponding growth in utility-maximizing weight. One result is that efforts to reduce weight have become more common as obesity has increased. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study uses Medicare claims data linked to two different surveysthe National Health Interview Survey and the Health and Retirement Studyto describe the relationship between insurance status before age 65?years and the use of Medicare-covered services beginning at age 65?years. Although we do not find statistically significant differences in Medicare expenditures or in the number of hospitalizations by previous insurance status, we do find that individuals who were uninsured before age 65?years continue to use the healthcare system differently from those who were privately insured. Specifically, they have 16% fewer visits to office-based physicians but make 18% and 43% more visits to hospital emergency and outpatient departments, respectively. A key question for the future may be why the previously uninsured seem to continue to use the healthcare system differently from the previously insured. This question may be important to consider as health coverage expansions are implemented.

Under the approximating model, simple sufficient statistics exist for the subject-specific parameters introduced to capture the unobserved heterogeneity between subjects. The latter must be distinguished from the state dependence which is accounted for by including the lagged response variable among the regressors. By conditioning on the sufficient statistics, we derive a pseudo conditional likelihood estimator of the structural parameters of the dynamic logit model, which is simple to compute. Asymptotic properties of this estimator are studied in detail. Simulation results show that the estimator is competitive in terms of efficiency with estimators recently proposed in the econometric literature. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The model has a time varying but locally linear drift and a volatility coefficient that is allowed to vary over time and space. The model is semiparametric because we allow these functions to be unknown and the innovation process is parametrically specified, indeed completely known. We propose estimators of all the unknown quantities based on long span data. Our estimation method makes use of the property of local stationarity. We establish asymptotic theory for the proposed estimators as the time span increases, so we do not rely on infill asymptotics. We apply this method to interest rate data to illustrate the validity of our model. Finally, we present a simulation study to provide the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators.

Methods: A discrete choice experiment cross-sectional survey was conducted in five general practices in England (October-November 2009). Four service attributes reported on the length of consultation and aspects of patient-professional interaction. A choice between three alternatives-novel pharmacist independent prescribing service (prescribing pharmacist), own (family) doctor service, and available (family) doctor service-was presented. Alternative regression models were compared according to their goodness of fit, and the preferred one was used to inform policy analysis. Results: A total of 451 patients completed questionnaires. Respondents preferred a pharmacist or own doctor compared with available doctor, with a larger value given to own doctor. All attributes on patient-professional interaction were important in choosing how to manage diagnosed hypertension, while the length of consultation (P - 0.42) did not have any impact. The impact of introducing a pharmacist prescribing service into a general practice setting was estimated from these findings. Patients' preferences suggested that about 16% of consultations with a patient's own doctor can be switched to a prescribing pharmacist instead. Although there is a stronger preference for seeing own doctor, alternative combinations of attribute levels can be used to compensate and reconfigure a more preferred prescribing pharmacist service. Conclusions: The pharmacist service is valued by patients as an alternative to doctor prescribing in primary care and therefore represents an acceptable form of service delivery when informing policy.","[Gerard, Karen; Latter, Sue] Univ Southampton, Fac Hlth Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Tinelli, Michela] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Tinelli, Michela] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Blenkinsopp, Alison] Univ Bradford, Sch Pharm, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Alesha] Univ Queensland, Sch Pharm, Wolloongabba, Australia",University of Southampton; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen; University of Bradford; University of Queensland,"Gerard, K (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Fac Hlth Sci, Nightingale Bldg 67,Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",K.M.Gerard@soton.ac.uk,"Smith, Alesha J/F-3966-2010; Tinelli, Michela/C-3008-2016","Tinelli, Michela/0000-0002-8816-4389; Blenkinsopp, Alison/0000-0001-8872-2769; Latter, Susan/0000-0003-0973-0512; Smith, Alesha/0000-0003-1056-9527",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; National Institute for Health Research Career Development Award; ESRC/MRC Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellowship,Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; National Institute for Health Research Career Development Award; ESRC/MRC Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This is an independent report commissioned and funded by the Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health.

We analyzed resource use in the trial and estimated the long-term cost-effectiveness of SAPT from the perspective of the US health care system. Methods: We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis combining estimates from the trial and the literature to populate the previously validated Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) Diabetes Model. Results represent the use of 3-day sensors, as in the trial, and 6-day sensors, approved in most markets but not yet approved in the United States. Results: Within-trial hospital days, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Assuming 65% use of 3-day sensors, treatment-related costs in year 1 were an estimated $10,760 for SAPT and $5072 for MDI. Discounted lifetime estimates were $253,493 in direct medical costs and 10.794 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SAPT and $167,170 in direct medical costs and 10.418 QALYs for MDI. For 3-day and 6-day sensors, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $229,675 per QALY (95% confidence interval $139,071-$720,865) and $168,104 per QALY (95% confidence interval $102,819-$523,161), respectively. The ratios ranged from $69,837 to $211,113 per QALY with different strategies for incorporating utility benefits resulting from less fear of hypoglycemia with SAPT. Conclusion: Despite superior clinical benefits of SAPT compared with MDI, SAPT does not appear to be economically attractive in the United States for adults with type 1 diabetes in its current state of development. However, further clinical developments reducing disposable costs of the system could significantly improve its economic attractiveness.","[Kamble, Shital; Schulman, Kevin A.; Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27715 USA; [Schulman, Kevin A.; Reed, Shelby D.] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27715 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Reed, SD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Sch Med, POB 17969, Durham, NC 27715 USA.",shelby.reed@duke.edu,,,Medtronic Diabetes; Duke University,Medtronic Diabetes; Duke University,This work was supported by a research agreement between Medtronic Diabetes and Duke University.,,24,20,22,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,632,638,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.011,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867771.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100005,0

Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyze the subjective perception of financial security in the event of illness in the German setting over time and to identify major determinants of that perception. Methods: We applied a probit-adapted ordinary least squares estimation procedure including fixed effects to a balanced data set from the German Socio-Economic Panel. After correcting our data set, we included approximately 23,500 observations in our analyses. Results: We show that higher income and the existence of private health insurance have a positive and significant impact on the perception of financial security. Furthermore, private supplementary health insurance has a positive and significant effect on this perception; however, this is solely true for policies that cover special features during hospital stays. Experience with the health care system is also positively related to the individual's perception. Finally, our regression results illustrate that the overall perception is declining over time. Conclusions: The results indicate that political decision makers are facing challenges regarding the declining subjective perception in the German health care system. Because of the positive correlation between experience and subjective perception, it can be assumed that the health care system and especially statutory health insurance are better than their presentation in the media. Hence, there is a problem of communication and information, and political decision makers face challenges in presenting the system objectively and handling the media in a proper way.","[Lange, Ansgar; Prenzler, Anne] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Zuchandke, Andy] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Risk & Insurance, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Leibniz University Hannover,"Lange, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",al@ivbl.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2012,15,5.0,,,,,743,749,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.002,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,986AH,22867785.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000307311100019,0

To cover fluctuations in demand, they need to maintain reserve service capacity in the form of beds, equipment, personnel, etc. to minimize the probability of excess queuing or turning away patients, creating a trade-off between reserve service capacity and economic costs. Using a simple theoretical framework, we show how the reserve capacity established depends on institutional characteristics that can affect the objective of the hospital. In particular, we show that private and public hospitals may provide different levels of reserve capacity. In an empirical application using a panel data set of Spanish hospitals over the period 1996-2006, we model reserve service capacity using a distance frontier approach. Our results show that private hospitals generally react to a lesser extent to demand uncertainty than public hospitals.

(1996) on the impact of Swan-Ganz catheterization on mortality outcomes. The study by Connors et al. (1996) assumes that there are no unobserved differences between patients who are catheterized and patients who are not catheterized and finds that catheterization increases patient mortality. We instead allow for such differences between patients by implementing both the instrumental variable bounds of Manski (1990), which only exploits an instrumental variable, and the bounds of Shaikh and Vytlacil (2011), which exploit mild nonparametric, structural assumptions in addition to an instrumental variable. We propose and justify the use of indicators of weekday admission as an instrument for catheterization in this context. We find that in our application, the Manski (1990) bounds do not indicate whether catheterization increases or decreases mortality, where as the Shaikh and Vytlacil (2011) bounds reveal that at least for some diagnoses, Swan-Ganz catheterization reduces mortality at 7 days alter catheterization. We show that the bounds of Shaikh and Vytlacil (2011) remain valid under even weaker assumptions than those described in Shaikh and Vytlacil (2011). We also extend the analysis to exploit a further nonparametric, structural assumption - that doctors catheterize individuals with systematically worse latent health - and find that this assumption further narrows these bounds and strengthens our conclusions. In our analysis, we construct confidence regions using the methodology developed in Romano and Shaikh (2008).

We develop an 'optimization' error approach that allows for estimation of values assuming that observed bids differ from optimal bids. We further augment this approach by allowing systematic over or underbidding by bidders using ideas from the stochastic frontier literature. We perform a simulation study to showcase the appeal of the method and apply the techniques to timber auction data collected in British Columbia. Our results suggest that significant underbidding is present in the timber auctions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I investigate whether variation in the level of managed care penetration is associated with changes in state-level diffusion of three newer classes of psychotropic medications in fee-for-service Medicaid programs from 1991 to 2005. Three different types of managed care programs are examined: capitated managed care, any type of managed care and behavioral health carve-outs. A fourth-order polynomial fixed effect regression model is used to model the diffusion path of newer antidepressant and antipsychotic medications controlling for time-varying state characteristics. Substantial differences are found in the diffusion paths by the degree of managed care use in each state Medicaid program. The largest effect is seen through spillover effects of capitated managed care programs; states with greater capitated managed care have greater initial shares of newer psychotropic medications. The influence of carve-outs and of all types of managed care combined on the diffusion path was modest.

Methods: We conducted a cohort study of health-care costs in British Columbia, Canada, by comparing new patients on tiotropium with new patients on ipratropium. Direct health-care costs for study patients were measured in the first 2 years after initiating inhaled anticholinergic treatment. Differences in direct health-care costs between tiotropium and ipratropium patients were estimated by using quantile regression. We analyzed cost differences in the 10th percentile, median, and 90th percentile of patients by cost. High-dimensional propensity score analysis was used as a method of adjustment for potential confounding factors. Results: The study population had 3,140 tiotropium patients and 26,182 ipratropium patients. Higher health system costs in patients who started on tiotropium instead of ipratropium were observed in patients in the median and 10th percentile. The magnitude of these increases was comparable to the price difference between the two drugs. Health system costs in the 90th percentile were not significantly different between tiotropium and ipratropium patients. Conclusions: The results of this study did not support the preferential use of tiotropium over ipratropium as a basis for savings in direct health-care costs.","[Dormuth, Colin R.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Anesthesiol Pharmacol & Therapeut, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Dormuth, Colin R.; Carney, Greg] Univ British Columbia, Pharmacoepidemiol Grp, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Yamaguchi, Jesse; Wilmer, Brett; Hosick, David] British Columbia Minist Hlth, Pharmaceut Serv Div, Policy Outcomes Evaluat & Res Branch, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Stuermer, Til] Univ N Carolina, Dept Epidemiol, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Dormuth, CR (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Anesthesiol Pharmacol & Therapeut, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",colin.dormuth@ti.ubc.ca,"Carney, Greg/T-5180-2019; Stürmer, Til/AAB-5459-2022","Dormuth, Colin/0000-0001-8577-8783","British Columbia Ministry of Health; National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health [RO1 AG023178, RO1 AG018833]; UNC-DEcIDE center from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Merck Co., Inc.; Sanofi-Aventis, Inc.; UNC-GSK Center of Excellence in Pharmacoepidemiology and Public Health","British Columbia Ministry of Health; National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); UNC-DEcIDE center from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Merck Co., Inc.(Merck & Company); Sanofi-Aventis, Inc.(Sanofi-Aventis); UNC-GSK Center of Excellence in Pharmacoepidemiology and Public Health","Participation of the University of British Columbia coauthors Dr. Colin Dormuth and Greg Carney was funded by a contribution from the British Columbia Ministry of Health to the University of British Columbia.

In this paper, we consider the timing of medical intervention as an optimal stopping problem. The development of the patient's health state in the absence of intervention follows a stochastic process (geometric Brownian motion). Spontaneous recovery occurs in case the absorbing state of good health is reached. We determine optimal threshold values for initiating the intervention, and derive comparative statics results with respect to the model parameters. In particular, an increase in the degree of uncertainty over the patient's development in most cases makes waiting more attractive. However, this may not hold if the patient's health state has a tendency to improve. The model can be extended to allow for risk aversion and for sudden, Poisson-type shocks to the patient's health state. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A systematic search for previously published studies reporting the costs for AF patients was conducted. Data were analyzed in three steps: first by evaluating overall system costs; second by evaluating the relative contribution of specific cost components; and third by examining variations across study designs, across primary treatment approach, and by geography. Finally, a specific review of the treatment costs associated with anticoagulation treatment was examined given the clinical importance and attention given to these costs in the literature. Results: The literature search resulted in 115 articles. On review of the abstracts or full text of these articles, 21 articles met all study criteria and reported on health system AF-related direct costs. A further six articles focused exclusively on anticoagulation costs for patients with AF. The overall average annual system cost across 27 esti-mates obtained from the literature was $5450 (SD = $3624) in 2010 Canadian dollars and ranged from a low of $1,632 to a high of $21,099. About one-third of these costs could be attributed to anticoagulation management. The largest cost component was acute care, followed by outpatient and physician and then medication-related costs. Conclusion: AF-related medical costs are high, reflecting resource-intensive and long-term treatments including anticoagulation treatment. These costs, accompanied with increasing prevalence, justify increased attention to the management of patients with AF. Future studies of AF cost should ensure a broad assessment of the incremental direct medical and societal cost associated with this diagnosis.","[Wodchis, Walter P.] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada; [Wodchis, Walter P.] Toronto Rehabil Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bhatia, R.

First, we revisit the extended concentration index which has been proposed to make it possible to introduce changes into the distributional value judgements implicit in the standard concentration index. Next, we suggest an alternative index based on a different weighting scheme. In contrast to the extended concentration index, this new index has the 'symmetry' property. We also show how these indices can be generalized so that they satisfy the 'mirror' property, which may be seen as a desirable property when dealing with bounded variables. We compare the different indices empirically for under-five mortality rates and the number of antenatal visits in developing countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed in this indication, from the perspective of the Swiss health care system, and assessed the influence of the costs of best supportive care (BSC) on overall cost-effectiveness. Methods: A Markov model was constructed based on the pemetrexed maintenance study, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding pemetrexed until disease progression was calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Uncertainties concerning the costs of BSC on the ICER were addressed. Results: The base case ICER for maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus BSC compared to BSC alone was (sic) 106,202 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Varying the costs for BSC had a marked effect. Assuming a reduction of the costs for BSC by 25% in the pemetrexed arm resulted in an ICER of (sic)47,531 per quality-adjusted life-year, which is below predefined criteria for cost effectiveness in Switzerland. Conclusions: Switch maintenance with pemetrexed in patients with advanced nonsquamous-cell lung cancer after standard first-line chemotherapy is not cost-effective.

Methods: We built a Markov model based on disease progression. The health-care costs of screening and treatment were received from real-word data. Other input data were obtained from the literature. The cost-effectiveness of the current screening program (a screening test that combines cytology and colposcopy in gynecological outpatient services) and of a planned new screening program (only cytology, and Pap smear is taken locally by public health nurses), both supported with a more active communication campaign, were compared with no screening. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the intensified current screening practice was $33,100 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no screening, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the renewed program was $18,990 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no screening. The most influential parameters in the deterministic analysis were the quality-of-life weights of undetected stage I or IIA cancer. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99.9% of the simulations were below the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in the case of the renewed strategy. Conclusions: Providing services closer to the population is a rational economic option for the reform of the Hungarian cervical cancer screening program. The other policy aspects of this development, human resource need, stakeholders' interests, organizational aspects, and attitude of the target population need to be carefully considered.","[Voko, Zoltan; Kalo, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Voko, Zoltan; Nagyjanosi, Laszlo; Kalo, Zoltan] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Margitai, Barnabas] Inst Healthcare Qual Improvement & Hosp Engn, Budapest, Hungary; [Koevi, Rita] Natl Hlth Insurance Fund, Budapest, Hungary; [Toth, Zoltan] Univ Debrecen, Med & Hlth Sci Ctr, Fac Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Debrecen, Hungary; [Laszlo, Daniel] St Stephen Hosp, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University; University of Debrecen,"Vokó, Z (通讯作者)，Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",voko@caesar.elte.hu,"Vokó, Zoltán/O-3747-2019; Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011; Vokó, Zoltán/H-1153-2017","Vokó, Zoltán/0000-0002-1004-1848; Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Vokó, Zoltán/0000-0002-1004-1848",Ministry of Health of Hungary,Ministry of Health of Hungary,This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Health of Hungary.,,19,8,8,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,,,,39,45,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.10.003,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GU,22264970.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299318500005,0

There is a need for interventions to support the uptake of RDTs by health workers. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing RDTs with basic or enhanced training in health facilities in which microscopy was available, compared with current practice. Methods: A three-arm cluster randomized trial was conducted in 46 facilities in central and northwest Cameroon. Basic training had a practical session on RDTs and lectures on malaria treatment guidelines. Enhanced training included small-group activities designed to change health workers' practice and reduce the consumption of antimalarials among test-negative patients. The primary outcome was the proportion of febrile patients correctly treated: febrile patients should be tested for malaria, artemisinin combination therapy should be prescribed for confirmed cases, and no antimalarial should be prescribed for patients who are test-negative. Individual patient data were obtained from facility records and an exit survey. Costs were estimated from a societal perspective using project reports and patient exit data The analysis used bivariate multilevel modeling and adjusted for imbalance in baseline covariates. Results: Incremental cost per febrile patient correctly treated was $8.40 for the basic arm and $3.71 for the enhanced arm. On scale-up, it was estimated that RDTs with enhanced training would save $0.75 per additional febrile patient correctly treated. Conclusions: Introducing Rat's with enhanced training was more cost-effective than Rat's with basic training when each was compared with current practice.","[Mangham-Jefferies, Lindsay; Wiseman, Virginia; Drake, Thomas L.] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Achonduh, Olivia A.; Mbacham, Wilfred] Univ Yaounde I, Lab Publ Hlth Res Biotechnol, Ctr Biotechnol, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Drake, Thomas L.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Oxford, England; [Drake, Thomas L.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Bangkok, Thailand; [Cundill, Bonnie] Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Onwujekwe, Obinna] Univ Nigeria, Coll Med, Dept Hlth Adm & Management, Enugu, Nigeria",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Yaounde I; University of Oxford; Mahidol University; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Nigeria,"Mangham-Jefferies, L (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",lindsay.mangham-jefferies@lshtm.ac.uk,"Wiseman, Virginia/AAH-5011-2021; Onwujekwe, Obinna/O-6232-2014","Cundill, Bonnie/0000-0002-3648-820X; Achonduh-Atijegbe, Olivia/0000-0003-3583-522X; Mangham-Jefferies, Lindsay/0000-0002-7292-6342; Onwujekwe, Obinna/0000-0002-1214-4285; Mbacham, Wilfred/0000-0002-3934-3233; Drake, Tom/0000-0002-6781-6632; Wiseman, Virginia/0000-0002-7911-0741",ACT Consortium - Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,ACT Consortium - Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"The research was supported by the ACT Consortium, which is funded through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",,29,13,13,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2014,17,8.0,,,,,783,791,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.07.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AX4RC,25498773.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346918100004,0

We study the impact of retiree health coverage on the labor supply of public sector workers between the ages of 55 and 64. We find that retiree health coverage raises the probability of stopping full time work by 4.3 percentage points (around 38 percent) over two years among public sector workers aged 55-59, and by 6.7 percentage points (around 26 percent) over two years among public sector workers aged 60-64.

The purpose of this study is to fill in this gap by proposing a primal Divisia-type productivity index that is valid in the presence of undesirable outputs. The new productivity index is derived by total differentiation of the directional output distance function with respect to a time trend and referred to as the Divisia Luenberger productivity index. We also empirically compare the Divisia-Luenberger productivity index and a representative of the conventional Divisia productivity indexes - the radial-output-distance-function-based Feng and Serletis (2010) productivity index - using aggregate data on 15 OECD countries over the period 1981-2000. Our empirical results show that failure to take into account undesirable outputs not only leads to misleading rankings of countries both in terms of productivity growth and in terms of technological change, but also results in wrong conclusions concerning efficiency change.

Objectives: We provide an overview of how to address crossover, implications for risk-effect estimates of survival (hazard ratios) and cost-effectiveness, and how this influences decisions of reimbursement agencies. Two case studies using data from two phase III sunitinib oncology trials are used as illustration. Methods: We reviewed the literature on statistical methods for adjusting for crossover and recent health technology assessment decisions in oncology. Results: We show that for a trial with a high proportion of crossover from the control arm to the investigational arm, the choice of the statistical method greatly affects treatment effect estimates and cost-effectiveness because the range of relative mortality risk for active treatment versus control is broad. With relatively frequent crossover, one should consider either the inverse probability of censoring weighting or the rank-preserving structural failure time model to minimize potential bias, with choice dependent on crossover characteristics, trial size, and available data. A large proportion of crossover favors the rank-preserving structural failure time model, while large sample size and abundant information about confounding factors favors the inverse probability of censoring weighting model. When crossover is very infrequent, methods yield similar results. Conclusions: Failure to correct for crossover may lead to suboptimal decisions by pricing and reimbursement authorities, thereby limiting an effective drug's potential.","[Jonsson, Linus; Ekman, Mattias; Ramsberg, Joakim] OptumInsight AB, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sandin, Rickard] Pfizer Oncol, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Sollentuna, Sweden; [Charbonneau, Claudie] Pfizer, Global Outcomes Res, Specialty Care BU, Paris, France; [Huang, Xin] Oncol Clin Dev, San Diego, CA USA; [Jonsson, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden; [Weinstein, Milton C.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Weinstein, Milton C.] OptumInsight, Medford, MA USA; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",Pfizer; Pfizer; Stockholm School of Economics; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Hence, the effectiveness of medications in routine practice may differ. Objectives: The study objective was to compare the outcomes of an adherence-naive versus a dynamic adherence modeling framework using the case of statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Methods: Statin adherence was categorized into three state-transition groups on the basis of an epidemiological cohort study. Yearly adherence transitions were incorporated into a Markov microsimulation using Tree Age software. Tracker variables were used to store adherence transitions, which were used to adjust probabilities of CV events over the patient's lifetime. Microsimulation loops random walks estimated the average accrued quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and CV events. For each 1,000-patient microsimulations, 10,000 outer loops were performed to reflect second-order uncertainty. Results: The adherence naive model estimated 0.14 CV events avoided per person, whereas the dynamic adherence model estimated 0.08 CV events avoided per person. Using the adherence-naive model, we found that statin therapy resulted in 0.40 QALYs gained over the lifetime horizon on average per person while the dynamic adherence model estimated 0.22 incremental QALYs gained. Subgroup analysis revealed that maintaining high adherence in year 2 resulted in 0.23 incremental QALYs gained as compared with 0.16 incremental QALYs gained when adherence dropped to the lowest level. Conclusions: A dynamic adherence Markov microsimulation model reveals risk reduction and effectiveness that are lower than with an adherence-naive model, and reflective of real-world practice. Such a model may highlight the value of improving or maintaining good adherence.","[Slejko, Julia F.] Univ Washington, Sch Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sullivan, Patrick W.] Regis Univ, Sch Pharm, Denver, CO USA; [Anderson, Heather D.; Nair, Kavita V.; Campbell, Jonathan D.] Univ Colorado, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Ho, P.

We compare the social welfare achieved at a Cournot equilibrium to the maximum possible, for the case where the inverse market demand function is convex. We establish a lower bound on the efficiency of Cournot equilibria in terms of a scalar parameter derived from the inverse demand function, namely, the ratio of the slope of the inverse demand function at the Cournot equilibrium to the average slope of the inverse demand function between the Cournot equilibrium and a social optimum. Also, for the case of a single, monopolistic, profit maximizing supplier, or of multiple suppliers who collude to maximize their total profit, we establish a similar but tighter lower bound on the efficiency of the resulting output. Our results provide nontrivial quantitative bounds on the loss of social welfare for several convex inverse demand functions that appear in the economics literature.","[Tsitsiklis, John N.] MIT, Lab Informat & Decis Syst, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Xu, Yunjian] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore 138682, Singapore",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Xu, YJ (通讯作者)，Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore 138682, Singapore.",xuyunjian@gmail.com,"Xu, Yunjian/GQA-6611-2022",,National Science Foundation [CMMI-0856063]; Graduate Fellowship from Shell,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Graduate Fellowship from Shell,"This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CMMI-0856063 and by a Graduate Fellowship from Shell.

Evidence from states extending dependent coverage,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; Dependent coverage; Wages; Education,RISK-AVERSION; EMPLOYMENT; GENDER; POLICIES,"Little is known about how health insurance affects labor market decisions for young adults. This is despite the fact that expanding coverage for people in their early 20s is an important component of the Affordable Care Act. This paper studies how having an outside source of health insurance affects wages by using variation in health insurance access that comes from states extending dependent coverage to young adults. Using American Community Survey and Census data, I find evidence that extending health insurance to young adults raises their wages. The increases in wages can be explained by increases in human capital and the increased flexibility in the labor market that comes from people no longer having to rely on their own employers for health insurance. The estimates from this paper suggest the Affordable Care Act will lead to wage increases for young adults. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, a majority of children do not possess vaccination cards compiling information on timing. We investigated the benefits of vaccination cards for the uptake of immunizations against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), polio, tuberculosis (BCG), and measles using data on over 200,000 Indian children from the District Level Health and Facility Survey 3. Methodological issues such as whether parents of children with higher morbidity levels may have them vaccinated were investigated. The results from the models for DPT, polio, measles, and BCG vaccinations showed significant beneficial effects of maternal education, household possessions, and access to health care facilities. Moreover, models for children's ages at the time of vaccination showed significant interactions between maternal education and access to and availability of health care facilities. Finally, models for child morbidity due to diarrhea, cough, and fever showed that timely vaccinations against DPT, access to piped water, and cooking with electricity or natural gas were associated with lower morbidity. Overall, issuing paper or electronic vaccination cards to children is likely to enhance timely uptake of various immunizations thereby reducing child morbidity.

Using data on persons likely to participate in Exchanges drawn from five waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we measure plan incentives in two ways. First, we construct predictive ratios, improving on current methods by taking into account the role of premiums in financing plans. Second, relying on an explicit model of plan profit maximization, we measure incentives based on the predictability and predictiveness of various medical diagnoses. Among the chronic diseases studied, plans have the greatest incentive to skimp on care for cancer, and mental health and substance abuse. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

HEALTH RISK PERCEPTION AMONG THE OBESE,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,subjective expectations; health risk; obesity,EXPECTATIONS,"The perception of health risks and risky health behaviors are closely associated. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of health risk perceptions among obese individuals, aged 50-62 years. We compare subjective risk perceptions for various diseases elicited in the American Life Panel to individual's objective risks of the same diseases. We find that obese individuals significantly underestimate their 5-year risks of arthritis or rheumatism and hypertension, whereas they systematically overestimate their 5-year risks of a heart attack and a stroke. Obese individuals are thus aware of some but not all obesity-related health risks. For given diseases, we document substantial heterogeneities in the accuracy of expectations across individuals.

However, this method produces utilities that are distorted by several biases. One important bias entails the failure to incorporate time discounting. This paper aims to measure time discounting for health outcomes in a sample representative for the general population. In particular, we estimate TTO scores alongside time discounting in order to derive a set of correction factors that can be employed to correct raw TTO scores for the downward bias caused by time discounting. We find substantial positive correction factors, which are increasing with the severity of the health state. Furthermore, higher discounting is found when using more severe health states in the discounting elicitation task. More research is needed to further develop discount rate elicitation procedures and test their validity, especially in general public samples. Moreover, future research should investigate the correction of TTO values for other biases as well, such as loss aversion, and to develop a criterion to test the external validity of TTO scores.

We focus on forecasting and so the parsimony of the model is important for good performance. A prior is developed which allows the shrinkage of the regression coefficients to suitably change over time and an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method for posterior inference is described. The new method is applied to two forecasting problems in econometrics: equity premium prediction and inflation forecasting. The results show that this method outperforms current competing Bayesian methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the case of competition between a shopping mall (set of independent single-product shops) and a department store (single multiproduct shop), we find that: if the number of goods is low, all consumers shop at a single place; if it is moderately high, some consumers travel to both shopping centers to buy each good where it is cheaper (a single good is cheaper at the shopping mall). The shops at the mall, taken together, obtain a lower profit than the department store. Nevertheless, two shopping malls should be expected to appear endogenously. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Several specifications of multivariate time-varying weights are introduced with a particular focus on weight dynamics driven by the past performance of the predictive densities and the use of learning mechanisms. In the proposed approach the model set can be incomplete, meaning that all models can be individually misspecified. A Sequential Monte Carlo method is proposed to approximate the filtering and predictive densities. The combination approach is assessed using statistical and utility-based performance measures for evaluating density forecasts of simulated data, US macroeconomic time series and surveys of stock market prices. Simulation results indicate that, for a set of linear autoregressive models, the combination strategy is successful in selecting, with probability close to one, the true model when the model set is complete and it is able to detect parameter instability when the model set includes the true model that has generated subsamples of data. Also, substantial uncertainty appears in the weights when predictors are similar; residual uncertainty reduces when the model set is complete; and learning reduces this uncertainty. For the macro series we find that incompleteness of the models is relatively large in the 1970's, the beginning of the 1980's and during the recent financial crisis, and lower during the Great Moderation; the predicted probabilities of recession accurately compare with the NBER business cycle dating; model weights have substantial uncertainty attached. With respect to returns of the S&P 500 series, we find that an investment strategy using a combination of predictions from professional forecasters and from a white noise model puts more weight on the white noise model in the beginning of the 1990's and switches to giving more weight to the professional forecasts over time. Information on the complete predictive distribution and not just on some moments turns out to be very important, above all during turbulent times such as the recent financial crisis. More generally, the proposed distributional state space representation offers great flexibility in combining densities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As in the classical Cournot model, quantity-setting firms compete in the same market for a given homogeneous good. We show that, when the asset stock grows sufficiently fast, the unique globally asymptotically stable steady state of the dynamic Cournot game corresponds to the static Cournot solution. Initial differences between firms' production rates due to asymmetric allocations of asset stocks tend to disappear over time. When instead the asset stock grows slowly, the system does not converge to any stationary point. We also show that, within the class of linear feedback equilibrium strategies, besides the couple of strategies that stabilizes the states for every possible initial conditions, there exists another couple which is more efficient, in that it leads to higher stationary equilibrium profits for both firms, closer to the collusive outcome. Finally, we show that, as the discount rate approaches zero, there exist multiple linear feedback equilibrium strategies that induce a price trajectory that converges asymptotically to a price which is above the static Cournot equilibrium price.

Methods that downweight older data, such as rolling regressions, forecast averaging over different windows and exponentially weighted moving averages, known to be robust to historical structural change, are found also to be useful in the presence of ongoing structural change in the forecast period. A crucial issue is how to select the degree of downweighting, usually defined by an arbitrary tuning parameter.

Our analysis of administrative data on medical claims in Medicare Part D suggests that fewer than 25% of individuals enroll in plans that are ex ante as good as the least cost plan specified by the Plan Finder tool made available to seniors by the Medicare administration, and that consumers on average have expected excess spending of about $300 per year, or about 15% of expected total out-of-pocket cost for drugs and Part D insurance. These numbers are hard to reconcile with decision costs alone; it appears that unless a sizeable fraction of consumers place large values on plan features other than cost, they are not optimizing effectively.

This paper adopts three alternative normative ways of treating this correlation championed by Roemer, Barry and Swift and assesses their empirical relevance using survey data. We combine regression analysis with the natural decomposition of the variance to compare the relative contributions of circumstances and efforts to overall health inequality according to the different normative principles. Our results suggest that, in practice, the normative principle on the way to treat the correlation between circumstances and effort makes little difference on the relative contributions of circumstances and efforts to explained health inequality.

In 2006, the Medicare Advantage program implemented a competitive bidding system to determine plan payments. In perfectly competitive models, plans bid their costs and thus bids are insensitive to the benchmark. Under many other models of competition, bids respond to changes in the benchmark. We conceptualize the bidding system and use an instrumental variable approach to study the effect of benchmark changes on bids. We use 2006-2010 plan payment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, published county benchmarks, actual realized fee-for-service costs, and Medicare Advantage enrollment. We find that a $1 increase in the benchmark leads to about a $0.53 increase in bids, suggesting that plans in the Medicare Advantage market have meaningful market power. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"De Marco, G; Romaniello, M",,,,"De Marco, Giuseppe; Romaniello, Maria",,,A limit theorem for equilibria under ambiguous belief correspondences,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Previous literature shows that, in many different models, limits of equilibria of perturbed games are equilibria of the unperturbed game when the sequence of perturbed games converges to the unperturbed one in an appropriate sense. The question of whether such a limit property extends to the equilibrium notions in ambiguous games is not yet as clear as it seems; in fact, previous literature shows that the extension fails in simple examples. The contribution in this paper is to show that the limit property holds for equilibria under ambiguous belief correspondences (presented by the authors in a previous paper). Key for our result is the sequential convergence assumption imposed on the sequence of belief correspondences. Counterexamples show why this assumption cannot be removed. Finally, we derive a limit result for equilibria in incomplete information games under ambiguity as a corollary of our main limit theorem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We relate the location problem to weighted Fermat problems and ramified optimal transportation problems and analyze how transport technologies affect the firm's transportation and location choices. It is found that in general when the level of transport economies of scale is high, the firm locates its factory in the interior of the Weber triangle with a branching transport structure. Two examples are constructed to illustrate how interactions between transport technology and production technology would affect the firm's input purchase and factory location. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we investigate the determinants of the evolution of socioeconomic health inequality in the UK. We analyze the relation between household income and both the prevalence and the consequences of adverse health conditions by following up infants throughout early childhood. We find evidence for the hypothesis that parental income operates through two different channels: it reduces the likelihood of incurring certain illnesses and it cushions the consequences of health conditions. Our results also indicate that a higher household income increases the probability that children fully recover from some diseases within a given period.

We characterize population monotonic and incentive compatible mechanisms which allocate an object efficiently and respect a welfare lower bound chosen in the fair allocation problem of allocating a collectively owned indivisible good or bad when monetary transfers are possible and preferences are private information.

More precisely, we show by means of an example that two Bayesian agents with almost identical prior beliefs can agree to completely disagree on their posterior beliefs. Besides, a more detailed agent model is introduced where posterior beliefs are formed on the basis of lexicographic prior beliefs. We then generalize Aumann's agreement theorem to lexicographic prior beliefs and show that only a slight perturbation of the common lexicographic prior assumption at some - even arbitrarily deep - level is already compatible with common knowledge of completely opposed posterior beliefs. Hence, agents can actually agree to disagree even if there is only a slight deviation from the common prior assumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis suggests that both an increase in the coinsurance rate and stricter price regulations adversely affect R&D spending in the pharmaceutical sector. In contrast, entry deregulation may lead to higher R&D spending of pharmaceutical companies. The relationship between R&D spending per firm and the number of firms may be hump-shaped. In this case, the number of rivals which maximizes R&D expenditure per firm is decreasing in the coinsurance rate and increasing in labor productivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports on a tripartite early scientific advice pilot conducted by a pharmaceutical company (developer), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA: regulator) and the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee (PBAC) Secretariat (HTA agency) in Australia. The objective was to explore the practicality, feasibility, and sustainability of means of obtaining simultaneous scientific advice from both a regulatory and reimbursement perspective. Methods: Advice was sought for two development compounds in different disease areas. the focus was on matters of common interest to the TGA and the PBAC (i.e. the clinical evidence). Briefing books were prepared by the developer and supplied eight weeks prior to the meeting and only verbal advice was provided. Results: The pilot meeting took place in 2009. Each session lasted for approximately two hours and was structured around the questions in the briefing books. The representatives from the TGA and PBAC Secretariat provided well-informed, considered and careful advice for both compounds, which was predominantly actionable and practical. Discussion: The sessions proved highly informative and permitted better alignment of the possible positioning of new medicines with the clinical evidence that regulators and HTA agencies might subsequently require for favorable assessment. The process provided early and clear signals to inform major development investments and the probability of successful market access. A number of challenges need to be addressed before tripartite scientific advice can be provided on continual basis.","[Wonder, Michael] Wonder Drug Consulting, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Wonder, M (通讯作者)，POB 470, Cronulla, NSW 2230, Australia.",wonderdrug@optusnet.com.au,,,,,,,20,18,18,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,1067,1073,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.07.007,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041357.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700018,0

Methods: We presented physicians with two scenarios involving a hypothetical patient with metastatic cancer expected to survive 12 months with current treatment. In a life-prolongation scenario, we suggested that a new treatment increases survival at an incremental cost of $50,000 over the standard of care. Participants were asked what minimum improvement in median survival the new therapy would need to provide for them to recommend it over the standard of care. In the QOL-enhancing scenario, we asked the maximum willingness to pay for an intervention that leads to the same survival as the standard treatment, but increases patient's QOL from 50 to 75 (on a 0-100 scale). We replicated these scenarios by substituting a patient with congestive heart failure instead of metastatic cancer. We derived the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained threshold implied by each response. Results: In the life-prolongation scenario, the cost-effectiveness thresholds implied by oncologists were $150,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY for cancer and CHF, respectively. Cost-effectiveness thresholds implied by family physicians were $50,000/QALY regardless of the disease type. Willingness to pay for the QOL-enhancing scenarios was $60,000/QALY and did not differ by physicians' specialty or disease. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that family physicians value life-prolonging and QOL-enhancing interventions roughly equally, while oncologists value interventions that extend survival more highly than those that improve only QOL. These findings may have important implications for coverage and reimbursement decisions of new technologies.","[Greenberg, Dan; Yermiahu, Yuval] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Greenberg, Dan; Yermiahu, Yuval] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Greenberg, Dan; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Hammerman, Ariel; Vinker, Shlomo] Clalit Hlth Serv Headquarters, Chief Physicians Off, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shani, Adi] Chaim Sheba Med Ctr, Oncol Inst, IL-52621 Tel Hashomer, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Tufts Medical Center; Clalit Health Services; Chaim Sheba Medical Center,"Greenberg, D (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",dangr@bgu.ac.il,"vinker, Shlomo/HRC-3787-2023; Hammerman, Ariel/AAG-4399-2020","Hammerman, Ariel/0000-0002-4396-5246; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985",Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research,Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research,Source of financial support: The study was supported by a research grant from the Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research.,,15,11,15,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2013,16,5.0,,,,,842,847,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.04.010,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CL,23947979.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325466600019,0

As interventions targeting this crucial first phase can affect long-term adherence and outcomes, an international panel conducted a systematic literature review targeting behavioral or psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Eligible published articles presenting primary data from 1966 to 2011 were abstracted by independent reviewers through a validated quality instrument, documenting terminology, methodological approaches, and factors associated with initial adherence problems. Results: We identified 865 potentially relevant publications; on full review, 24 met eligibility criteria. The mean Nichol quality score was 47.2 (range 19-74), with excellent reviewer concordance (0.966, P < 0.01). The most prevalent pharmacotherapy terminology was initial, primary, or first-fill adherence. Articles described the following factors commonly associated with initial nonadherence: patient characteristics (n = 16), medication class (n = 12), physical comorbidities (n = 12), pharmacy co-payments or medication costs (n = 12), health beliefs and provider communication (n = 5), and other issues. Few studies reported health system factors, such as pharmacy information, prescribing provider licensure, or nonpatient dynamics. Conclusions: Several methodological challenges synthesizing the findings were observed. Despite implications for continued medication adherence and clinical outcomes, relatively few articles directly examined issues associated with initial adherence. Notwithstanding this lack of information, many observed factors associated with nonadherence are amenable to potential interventions, establishing a solid foundation for appropriate ongoing behaviors. Besides clarifying definitions and methodology, future research should continue investigating initial prescriptions, treatment barriers, and organizational efforts to promote better long-term adherence.","[Zeber, John E.] Cent Texas Vet Hlth Care Syst, Temple, TX 76502 USA; [Zeber, John E.] Scott & White Healthcare, Ctr Appl Hlth Res, Temple, TX USA; [Manias, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Williams, Allison F.] Monash Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Hutchins, David] CVS Caremark, Scottsdale, AZ USA; [Udezi, Waka A.] Univ Benin, Benin, Nigeria; [Roberts, Craig S.] Pfizer Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, New York, NY USA; [Peterson, Andrew M.] Univ Sci, Philadelphia, PA USA",University of Melbourne; Monash University; University of Benin; Pfizer,"Zeber, JE (通讯作者)，Cent Texas Vet Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Appl Hlth Res, 2102 Birdcreek Dr, Temple, TX 76502 USA.",zeber@uthscsa.edu,"Manias, Elizabeth/D-2035-2009; Roberts, Craig S/GLQ-8814-2022","Manias, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3747-0087; Roberts, Craig S/0000-0002-5852-9770",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR); ISPOR Medication Adherence & Persistence Special Interest Group,International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR); ISPOR Medication Adherence & Persistence Special Interest Group,"Source of financial support: This research was supported by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the ISPOR Medication Adherence & Persistence Special Interest Group, along with additional support provided by the authors' own institutions.

We formalize those principles as axioms for social preferences over distributions of health for a given population. We single out several focal population health evaluation functions, which represent social preferences, as a result of combinations of those axioms. Our results provide new rationale for popular theories in health economics, such as the unweighted aggregation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or healthy years equivalents (HYEs) and generalizations of the two, aimed to capture concerns for distributive justice, without resorting to controversial assumptions on individual preferences.

First we study some properties of risk measures. We show that the set of normalized (with respect to x(0)) price systems is weak star compact and by using this result we prove a maximum attainment representation theorem which improves the one of Jaschke and Kuchler (2001). Also we study how a risk measure changes under different safe assets and we show a kind of equivalence between these risk measures. In the sequel we study subspaces of E consisting of financial positions of risk greater or equal to zero and we call these subspaces unsure. We find some criteria and we give examples of these subspaces. In the last section, we combine the unsure subspaces with the theory of price-bubbles of Gilles and LeRoy (1992). In this study we use the theory of cones (ordered spaces). This theory allows us to generalize basic results and provides new proofs and ideas in the theory of risk measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse income-related inequity in cardiovascular disease-related healthcare utilisation by individuals reporting cardiovascular disease in England, including both horizontal and vertical aspects. For the analysis of vertical inequity, we use target groups to estimate the appropriate relationship between healthcare needs and use. We find that including vertical inequity considerations may lead us to draw different conclusions about the nature and extent of income-related inequity. After accounting for vertical inequity in addition to horizontal inequity, there is no longer evidence of inequity favouring the poor for nurse visits, whereas there is some evidence that doctor visits and inpatient stays are concentrated among richer individuals. The estimates of income-related inequity for outpatient visits, electrocardiography tests and heart surgery become even more pro-rich when accounting for vertical inequity.

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website: (www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.","[Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Drummond, Michael] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Carswell, Chris] Adis Int, Pharmacoecon, Auckland, New Zealand; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Greenberg, Dan] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Augustovski, Federico] Inst Clin Effectiveness & Hlth Policy IECS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Augustovski, Federico] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Briggs, Andrew H.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Mauskopf, Josephine] RTI Hlth Solut, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Loder, Elizabeth] Faulkner Hosp, Brigham & Womens Faulkner Neurol, Boston, MA USA",University of Ottawa; University of York - UK; University of Warwick; Adis International; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Ben Gurion University; Tufts Medical Center; University of Buenos Aires; University of Glasgow; Research Triangle Institute,"Husereau, D (通讯作者)，879 Winnington Ave, Ottawa, ON K2B 5C4, Canada.",donh@donhusereau.com,"Campbell, John/A-5792-2011; Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Curiello, Simona/HGT-7408-2022; Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021","Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876; Campbell, John/0000-0002-6752-3493; Carswell, Christopher/0000-0003-0828-0548; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985; Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,All CHEERS Task Force members are volunteers.

This is an oversight because such violations pose a challenge to health economics, where choice and valuation methodologies often are used interchangeably. This article reports two experiments that aim to test for preference reversals over outcomes defined by health status, using both open' and assisted' valuation procedures. Although systematic preference reversals in the direction generally reported in the literature were not observed, the rates of non-systematic reversal were substantial, measuring 3540%. By analysing the respondents' explanations for their answers, it is clear that many of them used heuristics to answer the questions, and they may have good reasons to do so, which undermines the notion that preferences are always fixed and stable. These results, and others like it, pose a challenge to those who unquestioningly assume procedural invariance and maintain that population preferences should be used to inform health policy.

Methods: Ordinary least squares regression models were applied to a cross-sectional data set of 216 patients with CRC collected from a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Item responses or scale scores of cancer-specific (QLQ-C30) and colorectal-specific health-related quality-of-life (QLQ-CR38/CR29) data and selected demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were used to predict the SF-6D scores. Model goodness of fit was examined by using exploratory power (R-2 and adjusted R-2), Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion, and predictive performance was evaluated by using root mean square error, mean absolute error, and Spearman's correlation coefficients between predicted and observed SF-6D scores. Models were validated by using an independent data set of 56 patients with CRC. Results: Both scale and item response models explained more than 67% of the variation in SF-6D scores. The best-performing model based on goodness of fit (R-2 = 75.02%), predictive ability in the estimation (root mean square error = 0.080, mean absolute error = 0.065), and validation data set prediction (root mean square error = 0.103, mean absolute error = 0.081) included variables of main and interaction effects of the QLQ-C30 supplemented by QLQ-CR29 subset scale responses and a demographic (sex) variable. Conclusions: SF-6D scores can be predicted from QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38/CR29 scores with satisfactory precision in patients with CRC. The mapping model can be applied to QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38/CR29 data sets to produce utility scores for the appraisal of clinical interventions targeting patients with CRC using economic evaluation.","[Wong, Carlos King Ho; Lam, Cindy L.

We adapt the framework for productivity measurement used in the National Accounts, making it applicable for sub-national comparisons using cross-sectional data. We assess the productivity of the National Health Service (NHS) across regions of England, termed Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs). Productivity is calculated by comparing the total amount of healthcare output to total inputs for each region, standardised to the national average. Healthcare output comprises 6500 different categories, capturing the number and type of NHS patients treated and the quality of care received. Healthcare inputs include NHS and agency staff, supplies, equipment and capital. We find that productivity varies from 5% above to 6% below the national average. Productivity is highest in South West SHA and lowest in East Midlands, South Central and Yorkshire and The Humber SHAs. We estimate that if all regions were as productive as the most productive region in England, the NHS could treat the same number of patients with (sic)3.2bn fewer resources each year. The methods developed lend themselves to investigate variations in productivity in other types of healthcare organisations and health systems.

For purposes of cost-effectiveness analysis, treatment effects on the DSM are often mapped into treatment effects on a generic health-related quality-of-life (QOL) scale, such as EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Trialists have the option of including generic QOL measures as trial outcomes. We consider the relative efficiency (estimate divided by its standard error) of treatment effects derived from the DSM, the generic QOL, the generic QOL indirectly estimated from the mapped DSM, and a pooled estimate combining the direct and indirect information on the generic QOL. By using a common factor theory of the relationship between the DSM and the generic QOL, we define the circumstances under which indirectly estimated generic QOL is more efficient than the direct one and when a pooled QOL estimate is more efficient than the DSM estimate. As long as the DSM is more responsive, there is always a threshold sample size above which the indirect estimate has better precision than the direct estimate. This threshold, however, increases as the (1) relative responsiveness ratio of the DSM to the generic QOL increases, (2) precision of the estimated mapping coefficient increases, and (3) true effect becomes smaller. The pooled estimate on the generic QOL may be more efficient than the DSM itself unless the reliability of the DSM is particularly high. Trials powered on DSMs are likely to have sufficient power to detect treatment effect on the generic QOL if a pooled estimate is used.

The tension becomes particularly evident in the context of scarce resources, where the risk of taking contentious coverage decisions increases rapidly. To ensure economic sustainability, the payers of health care think that the benefits from the use of the new technologies need to be commensurate with the costs. Therefore, many jurisdictions have programs of health technology assessment, which often results in restrictions of access to care, either through complete refusal to reimburse the technology or its restriction of use to only a subset of the eligible patient population. However, manufacturers feel that they should be adequately rewarded for their innovations and require sufficient funds to invest in further research. Finally, patients perceive these technologies to have added benefits, and so they are concerned when they are denied access. If sustainable access to health care is to be maintained in the future, approaches are needed to reconcile these different perspectives. This article explores the approaches, in both methods and policy, to help bring about this reconciliation. These include rethinking the notion of social value (on the part of payers), aligning manufacturers' research more closely with societal objectives, and increasing patient participation in health technology assessment.

Most likely, a short spell of severe undernutrition around the end of the war has impaired intrauterine conditions in early pregnancies and resulted in long-term detriments among the affected cohorts.

Delaying the action exogenously increases payoffs, but there is an early mover advantage. Riordan (1992) shows that in a preemption game with two asymmetric players, players act in decreasing order of efficiency. This provides a microfoundation to the assumption that entry in a market occurs in the order of profitability, commonly used in the empirical analysis of market entry. We provide a counterexample showing that with more than two players this intuitive result can be reversed. We present a preemption game of entry into a new market. The potential entrants are three asymmetric firms: one efficient firm with high post-entry profits, and two inefficient firms. We show that the set of parameters such that the equilibrium entry order does not reflect the efficiency ranking is nonempty, and analyse which changes in post-entry profits preserve this entry order.

We first characterise the comparative statics of changes in the distribution and dependence structure of the background risk. For unfair, undesirable and loss-aggravating increases in background risks (both dependent and independent), we then present necessary and sufficient restrictions on preferences such that greater background uncertainty leads to reduced risk taking. With mean-variance preferences, these restrictions boil down to simple conditions on the marginal rate of substitution between risk and return. They can be easily related to familiar notions such as risk vulnerability, properness or standardness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A total of 152 wrist fracture patients and 164 controls and 61 hip fracture patients and 61 controls with 15D and SF-6D scores were studied. Results: The mean 15D score decreased significantly in wrist fracture patients between baseline and 2-year follow-up (P = 0.003). A wrist fracture was a significant predictor of a decrease in 15D scores 2 years after fracture (B = -0.016; P = 0.049), along with low body mass index (B = -0.002; P = 0.009). In hip fracture patients, both 15D and SF-6D scores decreased significantly (P < 0.001). A hip fracture was a significant predictor of a decrease in 15D (B = -0.060; P = 0.001) and SF-6D (B = -0.096; P = 0.001) scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a fragility wrist fracture has a long-term negative effect on HRQOL, but not as strong as for fragility hip fractures. 15D seems to be more responsive than SF-6D when assessing HRQOL in patients with fragility fractures.","[Rohde, Gudrun; Haugeberg, Glenn] Sorlandet Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway; [Rohde, Gudrun] Univ Agder, Fac Hlth & Sport Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Moum, Torbjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Behav Sci Med, Fac Med, Oslo, Norway; [Haugeberg, Glenn] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, INM, Dept Neurosci, Rheumatol Div, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",University of Agder; University of Oslo; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Rohde, G (通讯作者)，Sorlandet Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Servicebox 416, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",gudrun.rohde@sshf.no,,,Competence Development Fund of Southern Norway; Health Southern Norway Regional Trust; Sorlandet Hospital HF,Competence Development Fund of Southern Norway; Health Southern Norway Regional Trust; Sorlandet Hospital HF,"Source of financial support: This work has been supported and funded by The Competence Development Fund of Southern Norway, Health Southern Norway Regional Trust, and Sorlandet Hospital HF.

The program will provide focused training in orthopaedic trauma surgery and fracture care utilizing a train-the-trainer approach. The purpose of this analysis was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the program relative to its potential to decrease disability in the Haitian population. Methods: Using established methodology originally outlined in the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease project, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for the OTCS program in Haiti. Costs and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted were estimated per fellow trained in the OTCS program by using a 20-year career time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to simultaneously test the joint uncertainty of the cost and averted DALY estimates. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $1200 per DALY averted, equal to the gross domestic product per capita in Haiti, was selected on the basis of World Health Organization's definition of highly cost-effective health interventions. Results: The OTCS program results in an incremental cost of $1,542,544 +/- $109,134 and 12,213 +/- 2,983 DALYs averted per fellow trained. The cost-effectiveness ratio of $133.97 +/- $34.71 per DALY averted is well below the threshold of $1200 per DALY averted. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis suggests that implementing the OTCS program is the economically preferred strategy with more than 95% probability at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200 per DALY averted and across the entire range of potential variable inputs. Conclusions: The current economic analysis suggests the OTCS program to be a highly cost-effective intervention. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the conclusions remain stable even when considering the joint uncertainty of the cost and DALY estimates.","[Carlson, Lucas C.; Slobogean, Gerard P.; Pollak, Andrew N.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Pollak, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Med, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Ctr, 22 S Greene St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",apollak@umoa.umm.edu,,,,,,,34,16,18,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,887,893,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.06.004,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999139.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800015,0

This paper studies the structure and properties of the class of exact balanced collections. Comparing the definition of exact balanced collections with the definition of balanced collections, the weight vector of a balanced collection must be positive whereas the weight vector for an exact balanced collection may contain one negative weight. We investigate minimal exact balanced collections, and show that only these collections are needed to obtain exactness. The relation between minimality of an exact balanced collection and uniqueness of the corresponding weight vector is analyzed. We show how the class of minimal exact balanced collections can be partitioned into three basic types each of which can be systematically generated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Over the last decade, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis has emerged as a DNA-based method with clinical applicability for specimen identity testing (also known as specimen provenance testing). Although the clinical utility of identity testing using STR-based analysis has been demonstrated in many studies, its economic value has not been established. Methods: We developed a decision-analytic model of the application of STR-based provenance testing of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens obtained as part of routine clinical care to rule out the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as compared with no STR-based testing. Using parameter values drawn from the published literature, the cost-effectiveness of STR-based testing was quantified by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Results: In comparison to the current standard practice of no identity testing, identity testing by STR-based analysis has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $65,570 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at a testing cost of $618 per person. At a cost of $515 per person, identity testing would meet the conservative standard of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. At a test cost of $290 per person, identity testing would be cost saving. Conclusion: Given the rapidly declining pricing of STR-based identity testing, it is likely that testing to confirm the identity of positive prostate biopsy samples will be a cost-effective method for preventing treatment errors stemming from misidentification. Studies to formally establish the frequency of specimen provenance errors in routine clinical practice would therefore seem justified.","[Pfeifer, John D.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Singleton, Michael N.; Gregory, Martin H.; Lambert, Dennis L.; Kymes, Steven M.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Econ Evaluat Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Pfeifer, JD (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, 660 S Euclid Ave,Campus Box 8118, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",pfeifer@path.wustl.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2012,15,6.0,,,,,860,867,,10.1016/j.jval.2012.04.011,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,010QS,22999136.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000309109800012,0
J,"Hudry, O",,,,"Hudry, Olivier",,,"On the computation of median linear orders, of median complete preorders and of median weak orders",MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TOURNAMENTS,"Given a finite set X and a collection Pi, called a profile, of binary relations defined on X (which can be linear orders, complete preorders, any relations, and so on), a relation R is said to be median if it minimizes the total number of disagreements with respect to Pi. In the context of voting theory, X can be considered as a set of candidates and the relations of Pi as the preferences of voters, while a median relation can be adopted as the collective preference with respect to the voters' opinions. If the relations of Pi are tournaments (which includes linear orders), then there always exists a median complete preorder (i.e. a median complete and transitive relation) which is in fact a linear order. Moreover, if there is no tie when aggregating the tournaments of Pi, then all the median complete preorders are linear orders. We show the same when the median is assumed to be a weak order (a weak order being the asymmetric part of a complete preorder). We then deduce from this that the computation of a median complete preorder or of a median weak order of a profile Pi of in linear orders is NP-hard for any even m greater than or equal to 4 or for odd m large enough with respect to vertical bar X vertical bar (about vertical bar X vertical bar(2)). We then sharpen these complexity results when coping with other kinds of profiles Pi for odd values of m. In particular, when the relations of Pi and the median relation are complete preorders, we obtain the same results for the NP-hardness of Kemeny's problem.

The inherent asymmetry in cost and risk aversion imposes an original restriction on the observed bid data, an exact equality which leads to the model semiparametric identification and estimation. The unobserved arguments of this equality need to be simulated in order to estimate the bidders' Constant Relative Risk Aversion or Constant Absolute Risk Aversion parameters and their heterogeneous cost distributions. In the Los Angeles City Hall construction contracts offered between 1994 and 2003. the model and methodology help reveal that financial asymmetries affect the firms' cost distribution, while experience influences their degree of risk aversion.

This rule is dynamically consistent but non-consequentialist, since forgone consequences are relevant for conditioning.

The goal is to (i) maximize the mean social welfare arising from an eventual outcome distribution, when a budget constraint limits what fraction of the population can be treated and (ii) to infer the dual value, i.e. the minimum resources needed to attain a specific level of mean welfare via efficient treatment assignment. We consider a treatment allocation procedure based on sample data from randomized treatment assignment and derive asymptotic frequentist confidence interval for the welfare generated from it. We propose choosing the conditioning covariates through cross-validation. The methodology is applied to the efficient provision of anti-malaria bed net subsidies, using data from a randomized experiment conducted in Western Kenya. We find that subsidy allocation based on wealth, presence of children and possession of bank account can lead to a rise in subsidy use by about 9% points compared to allocation based on wealth only, and by 17% points compared to a purely random allocation.

The Lisbon Treaty establishes that such an allotment must be done under degressive proportion to the population, and that every member state must receive no less than 6 and no more than 96 seats. A definition of degressive proportion was given in 2007 by Lamassoure and Severin as that, the ratio between population and assigned seats should not increase when population decreases. In addition, the Parliament size cannot surpass 751 seats. With these limitations, we first study some linear spline functions leading to allotments verifying limitations on minimum, maximum and size, and unrounded degressive proportionality (before rounding to integers). Next, restricted linear spline functions are used to obtain allotments verifying all four properties including rounded degressive proportionality, although sometimes a slightly smaller EP size must be considered.

The model has an intuitive econometric interpretation as a Fechner model of (relative) random errors.

The objective of the current study was to examine the burden of HCV in Japan from a patient's perspective. Methods: Using data from the 2008 and 2009 Japan National Health and Wellness Surveys, patients who reported an HCV diagnosis (n = 306) were compared with a propensity-score-matched control group (n = 306) on measures of quality of life (using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Instrument version 2), work productivity (using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire), and health-care resource use. All analyses applied sampling weights to project to the population. Results: Prior to matching, patients with HCV had higher rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (4.88% vs. 0.02%) and cirrhosis (12.20% vs. 0.11%) than did subjects without HCV. The propensity-matching process eliminated differences between the two groups on demographics and patient characteristics. The postmatching analysis found significantly lower levels of quality of life for patients with HCV as measured by bodily pain (72.07 vs. 76.28), general health (44.64 vs. 48.61), and mental health (66.50 vs. 70.32) (all Ps < 0.05). Furthermore, compared with the matched group, the HCV group had significantly higher workplace absenteeism (8.59% vs. 4.12%), overall work impairment (26.08% vs. 17.32%), and health-care provider visits in the past 6 months (14.80 vs. 9.74). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that HCV can be a substantial burden on patients in terms of quality of life in both physical and mental health measures. In addition, HCV can be a significant cost driver in terms of health-care use and lost productivity.","[DiBonaventura, Marco daCosta; Wagner, Jan-Samuel] Kantar Hlth, Hlth Sci Practice, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Liu, Gordon G.] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yong; L'Italien, Gilbert J.] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Global Hlth Outcomes & Outcomes Res, Princeton, NJ USA; [L'Italien, Gilbert J.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Langley, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Coll Pharm, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kamae, Isao] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Hlth Management, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan",Peking University; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Yale University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Keio University,"DiBonaventura, MD (通讯作者)，Kantar Hlth, Hlth Sci Practice, 11 Madison Ave,12th Floor, New York, NY 10010 USA.",marco.dibonaventura@kantarhealth.com,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),Bristol-Myers Squibb purchased access to the National Health and Wellness Survey and funded the analysis for this project.,,29,53,53,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN-FEB,2012,15,1.0,,S,,,S65,S71,,10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.012,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,879GF,22265070.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000299317000012,0

Methods: We identified economic evaluations or cost studies associated with randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed nonpharmacologic, nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Medline, Embase, PubMed, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, CENTRAL, EconLit, and OpenSIGLE were searched up to October 1, 2010. Study characteristics extracted include study population, health outcomes, and economic analysis elements. Economic analyses were assessed by using the Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument, and the methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials was graded by using an internal validity checklist. All costs were converted to 2008 US dollars. Results: Ten economic evaluations and one randomized controlled trial reporting health-care costs met our inclusion criteria. Interventions included exercise programs, acupuncture, rehabilitation programs, and lifestyle interventions. Six of the 11 studies exhibited high risks of bias for the cost and/or effect components of their cost-effectiveness estimate. Six studies used comparators of unknown cost-effectiveness. Four studies reported cost-effectiveness estimates lower than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. All studies evaluating exercise interventions found the programs to be cost saving. Conclusions: There is only limited evidence for the cost-effectiveness of conservative treatments for the management of hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. More high-quality economic evaluations of conservative interventions are needed to further inform practice.","[Pinto, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Phys Therapy & Human Movement Sci, Chicago, IL 60657 USA; [Pinto, Daniel] Univ Otago, Sch Physiotherapy, Ctr Physiotherapy Res, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Robertson, M.

Static pharmacoeconomic models have been used to conduct pharmacoeconomic analyses of pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programs. The objective of this study was to develop a transmission dynamic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Taiwan. Methods: An age-structured transmission dynamic model was populated with parameters from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database and publicly available sources to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of PCV13. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore model uncertainties. Results: In the basecase analysis, four-dose scheduled universal infant PCV13 vaccination will prevent 5112 cases of invasive pneumococcal diseases, 535,607 cases of all-cause hospitalized pneumonia, 726,986 cases of acute otitis media, and 420 deaths over a 10-year time horizon since 2009. The four-dose vaccination program is estimated to yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratioof US$38,045 and US$18,299 from payer and societal perspectives. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is most sensitive to vaccine price. The 95% confidence interval of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$10,186 to US$34,563 by multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses in the societal perspective. Conclusions: With a World Health Organization-recommended cost-effectiveness threshold, the PCV13 vaccination program would be cost-effective in Taiwan. To circumvent the lack of long-term real data, a transmission dynamic model is informative to decision makers on evaluating the long-term cost-effectiveness of PCV13.","[Chang, Chee-Jen; Wen, Yu-Wen; Wu, Chia-Ling; Fann, Cathy Shen-Jang] Chang Gung Univ, Clin Informat & Med Stat Res Ctr, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan; [Chang, Chee-Jen] Chang Gung Univ, Grad Inst Clin Med Sci, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan; [Wu, David Bin-Chia; Fann, Cathy Shen-Jang] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Huang, Yu-Chering] Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Pediat, Tao Yuan, Taiwan; [Fann, Cathy Shen-Jang] Acad Sinica, Inst Biomed Sci, Taipei, Taiwan",Chang Gung University; Chang Gung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chang, CJ (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ, Clin Informat & Med Stat Res Ctr, 259 Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Tao Yuan 333, Taiwan.",cjchang@mail.cgu.edu.tw,"Fann, Cathy SJ/F-9410-2010; Wu, David Bin-Chia/H-3267-2019","Fann, Cathy SJ/0000-0001-9025-2276; Chang, Chee Jen/0000-0002-7725-7555",National Science Council [NSC95-2320-B-182-022-MY2],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This study was supported by a grant from the National Science Council (NSC95-2320-B-182-022-MY2).

It shows that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the Barnett critique applies: while a Divisia aggregate of monetary services tracks the true monetary aggregate almost perfectly, a simple-sum measure often behaves quite differently. The model also shows that movements in both quantity and price indexes for monetary services correlate strongly with movements in output following a variety of shocks. Finally, the analysis characterizes the optimal monetary policy response to disturbances that originate in the financial sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, the same DM can prefer to bet in situations where she feels specially knowledgeable or competent even if the underlying contingencies have vague likelihoods. This separation in terms of sources of uncertainty is motivated by the Heath and Tversky's competence hypothesis as well as by the Fox and Tversky's comparative ignorance effect. Formally, we characterize preference relations over AnscombeAumann acts represented by J(f) = min(p is an element of C) integral(A)u(f)dp + max(p is an element of C) integral(Ac)u(f)dp, where u is an affine utility index on consequences, C is a nonempty, convex and (weak*) compact subset of probabilities measures, and A is a referential chance event. In this model there is a clear separation of ambiguity attitudes. The case E subset of A captures possible familiar target events while the case E subset of A(c) might refer to the case of relative ignorance concerning related contingencies. This model captures a special case of event dependence of ambiguity attitudes in which the well known maxmin model is a special case.

By using optimal control theory and applying the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation, we extend the original Poole results concerning the output stabilization properties of monetary policy to the case of fiscal policy. In particular, we look for the optimal setting of government expenditure and lump-sum taxation in the case that the fiscal authority wishes to keep the product close to a reference value and that the economy is assumed to be affected by stochastic disturbances of real and/or monetary type. According to our findings an expenditure rule is preferable to a taxation rule when the two instruments are independent. The introduction of a fiscal budget rule can make taxation preferable under a certain model parametrization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Using Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic medical records (January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009), we identified adults with at least one ADHD diagnosis and at least two subsequent prescriptions fills for ADHD medication. The date of first MH comorbidity diagnosis after the index ADHD diagnosis was defined as the index transition date. Continuous eligibility 12 months before and after the index transition date was required. For patients with multiple transitions (>= 2), the post-transition period reflected the 12 months after the second transition. HRU for all-cause inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, behavioral therapy, overall prescription fill counts, and ADHD-specific prescription fill counts and mean patient expenditure (2010 US $) were estimated. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate differences in HRU and expenditure between the pre- and post-transition periods, respectively. Results: Of the 3809 patients with ADHD identified, 989 (26%) had at least one transition (n = 357 single and n = 632 multiple). From the pre- to the post-transition period, for single transition cohort, all HRU increased significantly except for behavioral therapy. In the multiple transition cohort, all HRU increased significantly. Total expenditure increased by mean +/- SE of $1822 +/- $306 and $4432 +/- $301 (both P < 0.0001) in the single and multiple transition cohorts, respectively. Conclusions: Twenty-six percent of patients with ADHD transitioned to MH comorbid diagnoses. Increased HRU and expenditure were associated with MH transitions. Identifying of patients with ADHD at risk for MH comorbidities may help to improve their outcomes.","[Kawatkar, Aniket A.; Chu, Li-Hao] Kaiser Permanente So Calif, Pasadena, CA 91101 USA; [Knight, Tara K.; Nichol, Michael B.] Univ So Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Moss, Robert A.] So Calif Permanente Med Grp, Woodland Hills, CA USA; [Sikirica, Vanja; Hodgkins, Paul; Erder, M.

To do so, we exploit a major reform implemented in Quebec (Canada) in 1999. The Quebec Government introduced an optional mixed compensation (MC) scheme for specialist physicians working in hospital. This scheme combines a fixed per diem with a reduced fee for services provided, as an alternative to the traditional fee-for-service system. We develop a model of a physician's decision to choose the MC scheme. We show that a physician who adopts this system will have incentives to increase his time per clinical service provided. We demonstrate that as long as this effect does not improve his patients' health by more than a critical level, they will stay more days in hospital over the period. At the empirical level, we estimate a model of transition between spells in and out of hospital analog to a difference-in-differences approach. We find that the hospital length of stay of patients treated in departments that opted for the MC system increased on average by 4.2% (0.28 days). However, the risk of readmission to the same department with the same diagnosis does not appear to be overall affected by the reform. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The present study applies a nonparametric model to estimate and compare two HK and UK standard gamble values for six dimensional health state short form (derived from short form 36 health survey) (SF-6D) health states using Bayesian methods. Methods: The data set is the HK and UK SF-6D valuation studies in which two samples of 197 and 249 states defined by the SF 60 were valued by representative samples of the HK and UK general populations, respectively, both using the standard gamble technique. We estimated a function applicable across both countries that explicitly accounts for the differences between them, and is estimated using the data from both countries. Results: the results suggest that differences in SF-6D health state valuations between the UK and HK general populations are potentially important. in particular, the valuations of Hong Kong were meaningfully higher than those of the United Kingdom for most of the selected SF-6D health states. The magnitude of these country-specific differences in health state valuation depended, however, in a complex way on the levels of individual dimensions. Conclusions: The new Bayesian nonparametric method is a powerful approach for analyzing data from multiple nationalities or ethnic groups to understand the differences between them and potentially to estimate the underlying utility functions more efficiently.","[Kharroubi, Samer A.] Univ York, Dept Math, York YO24 3NB, N Yorkshire, England; [Brazier, John E.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [McGhee, Sarah] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Community Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of York - UK; University of Sheffield; University of Hong Kong,"Kharroubi, SA (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Math, York YO24 3NB, N Yorkshire, England.",samer.kharroubi@york.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Kharroubi, Samer/AAQ-4583-2020","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,25,16,16,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2014,17,4.0,,,,,397,405,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.02.011,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,AO1ON,24969000.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000341082900013,0

The measures were derived from four morbidity descriptive systems: 17 chronic diseases in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF); 17 chronic diseases in the Charlson scheme; 114 Expanded Diagnosis Clusters (EDCs); and 68 Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACGs). These were applied to patient records of 86,100 individuals in 174 English practices. For a given disease description system, counts of diseases and sets of disease dummy variables had similar explanatory power. The EDC measures performed best followed by the QOF and ACG measures. The Charlson measures had the worst performance but still improved markedly on models containing only age, gender, deprivation and practice effects. Comparisons of predictive power for different morbidity measures were similar for linear and exponential models, but the relative predictive power of the models varied with the morbidity measure. Capitation payments for an individual patient vary considerably with the different morbidity measures included in the cost model. Even for the best fitting model large differences between expected cost and capitation for some types of patient suggest incentives for patient selection. Models with any of the morbidity measures show higher cost for more deprived patients but the positive effect of deprivation on cost was smaller in better fitting models. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We obtain closed-form solutions for optimal consumption and portfolio choices for sophisticated individuals with log utility and numerical solutions for those with power utility. Compared to the results of Merton, we find that stochastic hyperbolic discounting increases the consumption rate but has no effect on the share of wealth invested in the risky asset.

From an equity viewpoint, it is regarded as preferable to co-payments. However, long waits are an indication of poor quality of service. To our knowledge, this analysis is the first to benefit from individual-level data from administrative registers to investigate the relationship between waiting time, income, and education. Furthermore, it makes use of an extensive set of medical information that serves as indicators of patient need. Differences in waiting time by socioeconomic status are detected. For men, there is a statistically highly significant negative association between income and waiting time, driven by men in the highest income group, which constitutes 12% of all men. More educated women, that is, those having an education above compulsory schooling, experience lower waiting time than their fellow sisters with the lowest level of education.

The smooth tests of Neyman (1937) may be employed to circumvent this power deficiency problem. Yet, such tests may be difficult to compute in many applications. In this paper, we propose a more operational approach to constructing smooth tests. This approach hinges on a Fourier representation of the postulated empirical process with known Fourier coefficients, and the proposed test is based on the normalized principal components associated with the covariance matrix of finitely many Fourier coefficients. The proposed test thus needs only standard principal component analysis that can be carried out using most econometric packages. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed test and consider two data-driven methods for determining the number of Fourier coefficients in the test statistic. Our simulations show that the proposed tests compare favorably with the conventional smooth tests in finite samples.

The novelty is modeling this distribution with an infinite mixture of Normals, where the mixture unknowns have a Dirichlet process prior. Cumulative Bayes factors show our semiparametric model accurately forecasting market returns. During tranquil markets, expected volatility rises (declines, then rises as the shock increases) when the market shock is negative (positive). This asymmetry is muted when the market is volatile. In other words, when times are good, no news is good news, but during bad times, neither good nor bad news matters with regards to volatility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we extend this method to analyze the behavior of infinite dimensional economies. We introduce the definition of the social equilibrium set, and we show that there exists a bijection between this set and the Walrasian equilibrium set of an infinite dimensional economy. In order to describe the main topological characteristics of both sets, we analyze the main differential characteristics of the excess utility function and then, we extend the method of the natural projection as suggested by Y.

This study's objective was to examine the economic burden of nonsevere nocturnal hypoglycemic events (NSNHEs). Methods: A 20-minute Web based survey, with items derived from the literature, expert input, and patient interviews, assessing the impact of NSNHEs was administered in nine countries to 18 years and older patients with self-reported diabetes having an NSNHE in the past month. Results: A total of 20,212 persons were screened, with 2,108 respondents meeting criteria and included in the analysis sample. The cost of lost work productivity per NSNHE was estimated to be between $10.21 (Germany) and $28.13 (the United Kingdom), representing 3.3 to 7.5 hours of lost work time per event. A reduction in work productivity (presenteeism) was also reported. Compared with respondents' usual blood sugar monitoring practice, on average, 3.6 +/- 6.6 extra tests were conducted in the week following the event at a cost of approximately $87.1 per year Additional costs were also incurred for doctor visits as well as medical care required because of falls or injuries incurred during the NSNHE for an annual cost of $2,111.3 per person per year When taking into consideration the multiple impacts of NSNHEs for the total sample and the frequency that these events occur, the resulting total annual economic burden was $288,000 or $127 per person per event. Conclusions: NSNHEs have serious consequences for patients. Greater attention to treatments that reduce NSNHEs can have a major impact on reducing the economic burden of diabetes.","[Brod, Meryl] Brod Grp, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA; [Wolden, Michael; Christensen, Torsten] Novo Nordisk AS, Soborg, Denmark; [Bushnell, Donald M.] Hlth Res Associates Inc, Mountlake Terrace, WA USA",The Brod Group; Novo Nordisk,"Brod, M (通讯作者)，Brod Grp, 219 Julia Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA.",mbrod@thebrodgroup.net,,,Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S(Novo Nordisk),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk A/S.,,37,44,48,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2013,16,8.0,,,,,1140,1149,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.09.002,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,274XV,24326167.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328640400004,0

The framework focuses on expenditures at the disease level that are decomposed between price and utilization. We find that both price and utilization differences are important contributors to expenditure differences across commercial markets. Further examination shows that for some diseases utilization drives variation while for others price is more important. Finally, when disease-specific measures are aggregated across diseases, much of the important disease-specific variation is masked, leading to much smaller measures of aggregate variation.

However, the QR framework that has pervaded the applied economics literature is based on the conditional quantile regression method. It is used to assess the impact of a covariate on a quantile of the outcome conditional on specific values of other covariates. In most cases, conditional quantile regression may generate results that are often not generalizable or interpretable in a policy or population context. In contrast, the unconditional quantile regression method provides more interpretable results as it marginalizes the effect over the distributions of other covariates in the model. In this paper, the differences between these two regression frameworks are highlighted, both conceptually and econometrically. Additionally, using real-world claims data from a large US health insurer, alternative QR frameworks are implemented to assess the differential impacts of covariates along the distribution of medication adherence among elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease.

J,"Frueh, FW",,,,"Frueh, Felix W.",,,"Regulation, Reimbursement, and the Long Road of Implementation of Personalized Medicine-A Perspective from the United States",VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,health economics; outcomes research; personalized medicine; regulatory; reimbursement,COST-EFFECTIVENESS; US FDA; PHARMACOGENOMICS; CLOPIDOGREL; PROGNOSIS; THERAPY,"There is undisputed evidence that personalized medicine, that is, a more precise assessment of which medical intervention might best serve an individual patient on the basis of novel technology, such as molecular profiling, can have a significant impact on clinical outcomes. The field, however, is still new, and the demonstration of improved effectiveness compared with standard of care comes at a cost How can we be sure that personalized medicine indeed provides a measurable clinical benefit, that we will be able to afford it, and that we can provide adequate access? The risk-benefit evaluation that accompanies each medical decision requires not only good clinical data but also an assessment of cost and infrastructure needed to provide access to technology. Several examples from the last decade illustrate which types of personalized medicines and diagnostic tests are easily being taken up in clinical practice and which types are more difficult to introduce. And as regulators and payers in the United States and elsewhere are taking on personalized medicine, an interesting convergence can be observed: better, more complete information for both approval and coverage decisions could be gained from a coordination of regulatory and reimbursement questions. Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) emerges as an approach that can satisfy both needs. Although HEOR represents a well established approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions in many areas of medical practice, few HEOR studies exist in the field of personalized medicine today. It is reasonable to expect that this will change over the next few years.","Opus Three LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA",,"Frueh, FW (通讯作者)，Opus Three LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 USA.",felix@opusthree.com,,,,,,,27,18,18,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,S,,,S27,S31,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.06.009,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232CS,24034309.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325467800006,0

Cost-effectiveness must be assessed before routine LDCT screening is considered. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT lung cancer screening in Israel. Methods: A decision analytic framework was used to evaluate the decision to screen or not screen from the health system perspective. The screening arm included 842 moderate-to-heavy smokers aged 45 years or older, screened at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center from 1998 to 2004. In the usual care arm, stage distribution and stage specific life expectancy were obtained from the Israel National Cancer Registry data for 1994 to 2006. Lifetime stage-specific costs were estimated from medical records of patients diagnosed and treated at Hadassah Medical Center in the period 2003 to 2004. The analysis considered possible biases lead time, overdiagnosis, and self-selection. Cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained by screening was estimated. Results: Base-case incremental cost per QALY gained was $1464 (2011 prices). Extensive sensitivity analysis affirmed the low cost per QALY gained. The cost per QALY gained is lower than $10,000 with probability 0.937 and is lower than $20,000 with probability 0.978. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that baseline LDCT lung cancer screening in Israel presents a good value for the money and should be considered for inclusion in the National List of Health Services financed publicly.","[Shmueli, Amir] Braun Hebrew Univ, Hadassah Sch Publ Hlth, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Fraifeld, Shifra; Sosna, Jacob; Shaham, Dorith] Hadassah Hebrew Univ, Dept Radiol, Med Ctr, Jerusalem, Israel; [Peretz, Tamar; Gutfeld, Orit; Gips, Maya] Hadassah Hebrew Univ, Sharett Inst Oncol, Med Ctr, Jerusalem, Israel; [Sosna, Jacob] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,"Shmueli, A (通讯作者)，Braun Hebrew Univ, Dept Hlth Management, Hadassah Sch Publ Hlth, POB 12272, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",amirsh@ekmd.huji.ac.il,,,Israeli Cancer Society; Faculty of Medicine of the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine,Israeli Cancer Society; Faculty of Medicine of the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine,Source of financial support: The study was supported by grants from the Israeli Cancer Society and the Joint Fund of the Faculty of Medicine of the Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine.,,27,38,40,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2013,16,6.0,,,,,922,931,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.05.007,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,232DA,24041342.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000325468700003,0

Trimodality bladder-preserving therapy (BPT) is an alternative to RC, but randomized comparisons of RC versus BPT have proven infeasible. To compare RC versus BPT, we undertook an observational cohort study using registry and administrative claims data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database. Methods: We identified patients age 65 years or older diagnosed between 1995 and 2005 who received RC (n = 1426) or BPT (n = 417). We examined confounding and stage misclassification in the comparison of RC and BPT by using multivariable adjustment, propensity score-based adjustment, instrumental variable (IV) analysis, and simulations. Results: Patients who received BPT were older and more likely to have comorbid disease. After propensity score adjustment, BPT was associated with an increased hazard of death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.53) and from bladder cancer (HR 1.31; 95% CI 0.97-1.77). Using the local area cystectomy rate as an instrument, IV analysis demonstrated no differences in survival between BPT and RC (death from any cause HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.78-1.31; death from bladder cancer HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.55-1.18). Simulation studies for stage misclassification yielded results consistent with the IV analysis. Conclusions: Survival estimates in an observational cohort of patients who underwent RC versus BPT differ by analytic method. Multivariable and propensity score adjustment revealed greater mortality associated with BPT relative to RC, while IV analysis and simulation studies suggest that the two treatments are associated with similar survival outcomes.","[Bekelman, Justin E.; Christodouleas, John; Swisher-McClure, Samuel] Univ Penn, Dept Radiat Oncol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Bekelman, Justin E.; Ten Have, Thomas; Mitra, Nandita] Univ Penn, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bekelman, Justin E.; Polsky, Daniel; Mitra, Nandita] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Handorf, Elizabeth A.] Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA; [Guzzo, Thomas] Univ Penn, Div Urol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Pollack, Craig Evan] Johns Hopkins, Dept Gen Internal Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Resnick, Matthew J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Urol Surg, Nashville, TN USA; [Vaughn, David] Univ Penn, Div Med Oncol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Polsky, Daniel] Univ Penn, Div Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Fox Chase Cancer Center; University of Pennsylvania; Johns Hopkins University; Vanderbilt University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Bekelman, JE (通讯作者)，Dept Radiat Oncol, 3400 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bekelman@uphs.upenn.edu,,"Swisher-McClure, Samuel/0000-0002-9888-6641; Ten Have, Thomas/0000-0003-0026-3073","National Institutes of Health [RC4-CA155809]; National Cancer Institute [RC2-CA148310, K12-CA076931, 1K07CA163616]; Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research [1K07CA151910]; US Public Health Service [P30-CA016520]; Thomas B. and Jeannette E.

Objective: To test whether quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was a useful indicator of health inequalities. Methods: EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire data from a wellbeing survey was combined with actuarial life expectancy (LE) data to estimate healthy LE (HLE), that is, years of life lived in good health, and QALE, that is, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lived for Wirral, a borough in the north west of England. Results: The gap between Wirral and the most deprived areas was 4.45 years for LE, 5.34 for QALE, and 7.55 for HLE. The gap in QALE was 20% greater than the gap in LE, while the gap in HLE was 70% greater. Conclusions: The fact that the QALE gap value lies between the HLE value and the LE value suggests that QALE is a more sensitive indicator than HLE, as in this study QALE is derived from 243 possible EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire profiles whereas HLE is based only on whether or not an individual rates his or her health as good, a binary variable. This study discusses how QALE could be a useful indicator for measuring health inequalities in future, especially as cost utility and QALYs are seen as the gold standard used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom to measure outcomes for health interventions in England, and discusses how a monetary valuation of QALYs could be used to put a societal cost on health inequalities.","[Collins, Brendan] Univ Liverpool, NHS Wirral, Birkenhead CH41 5AL, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Collins, B (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Old Market House,Hamilton St, Birkenhead CH41 5AL, Merseyside, England.",Brendan.collins@nhs.net,,"Collins, Brendan/0000-0002-3023-8189",NHS Wirral,NHS Wirral,This work was funded by NHS Wirral.,,18,15,17,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2013,16,4.0,,,,,599,603,,10.1016/j.jval.2013.01.004,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,178IK,23796294.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321440900019,0

Therefore, parameters related to these indirect costs play a role in setting priorities for future research from a societal perspective. Until now, however, value of information analyses have usually applied a health care perspective for economic evaluations. Hence, the effect of productivity losses has rarely been investigated in such analyses. The aim of the current study therefore was to investigate the effects of including or excluding productivity costs in value of information analyses. Methods: Expected value of information analysis (EVPI) was performed in cost-effectiveness evaluation of prevention from both societal and health care perspectives, to give us the opportunity to compare different perspectives. Priorities for future research were determined by partial EVPI. The program to prevent major depression in patients with subthreshold depression was opportunistic screening followed by minimal contact psychotherapy. Results: The EVPI indicated that regardless of perspective, further research is potentially worthwhile. Partial EVPI results underlined the importance of productivity losses when a societal perspective was considered. Furthermore, priority setting for future research differed according to perspective. Conclusions: The results illustrated that advise for future research will differ for a health care versus a societal perspective and hence the value of information analysis should be adjusted to the perspective that is relevant for the decision makers involved. The outcomes underlined the need for carefully choosing the suitable perspective for the decision problem at hand.","[Mohseninejad, Leyla; Buskens, Erik; Feenstra, Talitha] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Unit Hlth Technol Assessment, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Baal, Pieter H.
