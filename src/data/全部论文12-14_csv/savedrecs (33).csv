Most frequent legal form among Czech non-profit organizations is civic association; it represents nine tenths of all Czech non-profits. Therefore, the aim of presented study was to determine current level of transparency in Czech civic associations. Within the defined aim were formulated five research questions focused on the website availability of: (1) the website itself; (2) clear definition of organizationis purpose of existence; (3) other basic information on organization (statutes, annual reports, etc.); (4) information on donations; and (5) reports and information on economical matters of organization. The research was conducted through a content analysis of websites on the sample of organizations (n=1,528) obtained through the random selection from the official database. The results showed that a website has less than a third of organizations (32.6 %), approximately three-quarters (77.8 %) then keep their websites current. The purpose of existence is rather not disclosed, since the mission was published only in one third (32.2 %) of cases and the visions were disclosed only in 5.3 % of organizations. The basic organizational documents were more often presented the statutes (26.9 %) than the annual reports (9.8 %). However, the donors have been published in 38.0 % of cases, only 3.0 % of organizations published not only the donor, but also donated amount. The worst situation exists in availability of economic records and information, financial statements were published only in 7.9 % of organizations, and a transparent account was available in 1.5 % of cases. Some study findings showed a slight improvement in web transparency of non-profits to compare with similar research made by T. Rohrbacher in 2008. Other findings are new in this area, though still not be subject to comparison, approaching the level of transparency of Czech non-profit organizations.","Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Managementu, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Bachmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fak Informatiky & Managementu, Katedra Managementu, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",pavel.bachmann@uhk.cz,"Bachmann, Pavel/H-6835-2012","Bachmann, Pavel/0000-0002-2823-8497",,,,,27,4,4,0,18,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Data were analyzed using a non-linear structural equation models with MPLUS5. The results provide support for distinguishing between the two complementary forms of market orientation, proactive and responsive. While proactive market orientation is a determinant of both innovation and market success of the organization, the impact of responsive market orientation on the innovation and market success is positive and significant only in a rapidly changing market environment. Companies can improve their innovation success and in turn market success by improving their proactive market orientation, i.e. by investing resources in exploring customer needs, customer problems with existing products and latent customer needs. The study contributes to the literature by examining the entire chain of relationships between market orientation, innovation success and market success by adopting both a responsive and proactive market orientation. It is the first study that examines these relationships in the context of companies from a European country and with consideration of market turbulence/changes.","[Bodlaj, Mateja; Zabkar, Vesna] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Coenders, Germa] Univ Girona, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, E-17071 Girona, Spain",University of Ljubljana; Universitat de Girona,"Bodlaj, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",mateja.bodlaj@ef.uni-lj.si; germa.coenders@udg.edu; vesna.zabkar@ef.uni-lj.si,"Zabkar, Vesna/H-7030-2018; Coenders, Germa/A-4294-2014","Zabkar, Vesna/0000-0002-9331-9090; Coenders, Germa/0000-0002-5204-6882; Bodlaj, Mateja/0000-0002-6097-0901",,,,,80,33,38,5,77,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The role of inter-firm network relationships, agglomeration economies and internationalization strategies is jointly analysed for a sample of 555 firms in the EmiliaRomagna (ER) region (North-East Italy). Cooperating with a certain kind of local actorsi.e. suppliers and universitiesis the most important EI driver for the investigated firms, along with their training coverage and their adoption of information and communication technologies. The role of agglomeration economies is instead less clear-cut. They spur EIs only in the presence of established LPS, with idiosyncratic sector specialization, while conversely they act as EI barriers. Networking effects and agglomeration economies are instead found to strongly promote the adoption of EIs by multinational firms, thus highlighting the importance of localglobal interactions. Interesting specifications for these results are found for particular kinds of EIs, in such fields as CO2 abatement and ISO labelling, generally extending the analysis of EI drivers by joining local and international factors. In addition, the role of regulatory sector factors confirms the induced innovation hypothesis and provides a robustness check to our results.","[Mazzanti, Massimiliano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Cainelli, Giulio] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management Marco Fanno, I-35100 Padua, Italy; [Cainelli, Giulio] CNR, CERIS, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Montresor, Sandro] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain; [Montresor, Sandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Padua; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); European Commission Joint Research Centre; University of Bologna,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ Inst & Terr, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.",mzzmsm@unife.it,"Montresor, Sandro/K-1833-2019","montresor, sandro/0000-0002-1195-901X; mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942",,,,,134,202,214,2,91,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The paper makes use of the data of 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China from 2000 to 2009 and makes an empirical analysis to study the long-term stable equilibrium relationship between the accident losses and highway mileages by using the panel unit root test and co-integration test of econometric methods. The result shows that there is a significant positive correlation relationship between the accident losses and highway mileages. To some extent, the stable relationship can be regarded as a valid reference of the relationship between net premiums of vehicle insurance and driving mileages. Moreover, the paper proposes some feasible programs to consider the relationship between net premiums of vehicle insurance and driving mileages, and provides further proposal for mileage-based pricing in vehicle insurance products of China. The results of the paper have important theoretical significance and practical value for driving mileages to be introduced and developed into GLM pricing in China's vehicle insurance, and also provide a reference to settle our transportation, energy and environmental problems.","[Chen Dongmei] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Insurance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Duan Baige] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Nankai University,"Chen, DM (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Insurance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",dmchen05@gmail.com; asabaigefsa@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,4,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89414-036-4,,,,2012,,,,,,,393,409,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEH69,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316628500032,0

In a model with two interrelated Hotelling lines, prices in both markets are corrected downward when compared to the standard Hotelling model. In the integrated business model, file sharing has an ambiguous effect on firms' profitability. As file sharing can indirectly increase demand for live performances, overall profits can either increase or decrease, depending on the strength of indirect network effects. Finally, file sharing may induce firms to switch from the traditional business model with two separate firms to an integrated business model where one agency markets both records and concerts (so-called 360 degrees deals).","[Dewenter, Ralf; Haucap, Justus; Wenzel, Tobias] Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Dewenter, R (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf Inst Competit Econ, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",dewenter@hhu.de,,"Haucap, Justus/0000-0002-9217-0343",,,,,19,17,22,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

The presence of long memory components in asset returns provides evidence against the weak-form of stock market efficiency. The starting working hypothesis that there is no long memory in the Croatian and Hungarian stock market returns is tested by applying the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) (1992) test, Lo's (1991) modified rescaled range (R/S) test, and the wavelet ordinary least squares (WOLS) estimator of Jensen (1999). The research showed that the WOLS estimator may lead to different conclusions regarding long memory presence in the stock returns from the KPSS and unit root tests or Lo's R/S test. Furthermore, it proved that the fractal structure of individual stock returns may be masked in aggregated stock market returns (i.e. in returns of stock index). The main finding of the paper is that both the Croatian stock index Crobex and individual stocks in this index exhibit long memory. Long memory is identified for some stocks in the Hungarian stock market as well, but not for the stock market index BUX. Based on the results of the long memory tests, it can be concluded that while the Hungarian stock market is weak-form efficient, the Croatian stock market is not.","[Dajcman, Silvo] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Festic, Mejra] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana 1505, Slovenia; [Kavkler, Alenka] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ Anal, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Razlagova 14, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",mejra.festic@bsi.si; alenka.kavkler@uni-mb.si; silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,66,5,5,0,8,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

The comparisons based on nominal tax rates predicate the real rate of taxation insufficiently because of these differences. More objective way how to measure the tax circumstances of the taxpayers in individual countries are relative indicators such as the tax incidence of the taxpayer with an average wage, the calculation of an effective tax rate or measuring the tax progressiveness. The index of the tax progressiveness which is based on the effective tax rate predicates the effective tax burden and the relationship between the change of the income and the tax burden. The personal income tax paid by the employee in the period of 1993-2008 in the Czech Republic was chosen for analysis. The paper deals with the application of tax progressiveness indices on the tax system of the Czech Republic. Calculations are performed of the effective tax rate, the progressiveness of the average rate, the progressiveness of the tax obligation and the progressiveness of earning after taxation for an employee who claims only the basic allowances (from 1993-2005), or the tax credit (from 2006-2008) and does not claim any other tax reliefs or credits.

Number of utilized systems for measurement and performance control were criticized due to many asymmetries in the sphere of measurement and control so far. Especially their synthetic view of performance, expressive orientation to past, disconnection of strategic stem with operative, minimal emphasis on intangible assets seen as vehicles of present as well as future company success were criticized. These deficiencies are markedly eliminated by Balance Scorecard system (BSC). It is approved system for measurement and performance control as well as for strategy implementation for almost 20 years, and predominantly in the countries of Western Europe and USA. The BSC basis is a formulation of vision, mission and strategy that are the result of company management consensus. The core of the system is the way and content of file measure conceivability in a mutual balance and also casual relations that are interconnected to strategy formulation. The correct construction of measures for company strategy is to tip the strategic priorities, and by means of casual-subsequent connection it is possible to tip the way to strategy realization. Equilibrium in system is provided by implementation balance and strategy evaluation. Besides many positive responses of implemented BSC system and its contribution to effective measurements and performance control in companies, there were also observed some negative experiences that declare an insufficient contribution of the BSC, dissatisfaction with the system and failure. This view signifies that the BSC system is non-functional as well as without any contribution. The article is based on the results of a research realized in a period of 2008-2011 in two phases. The aim of the first research phase (2008-2010) was to identify the problematic areas of the BSC system implementation and to propose some possible solutions. Together with the results of the first research, there was realized the second research (2010-2011) to verify the connection of aim fall, or more precisely the decrease of performance with the BSC system, and to convey the extent of function/malfunction of the BSC system in the individual respondent conditions.

This work offers a new conceptual proposal for organizational development that promotes creative and transforming processes in Latin America. The study is of a descriptive-documentary character. The principal outstanding results are: a) Arguments demonstrate that the traditional concept of organizational development limits integrated development on the continent, especially in terms of participation spaces for members of the company, community and other interest groups. Therefore, new conceptual categories should emerge. b) The conceptual approach of traditional organizational development must face the problem of substituting the capitalist vision that dominates production relations for a logic that stimulates integrated development. Conclusions are that innovative organizational development, as a new conceptual category, constitutes a strategy to generate, develop and sustain societal capacities for innovation that foment the innovative empowerment of citizens as well as their participation in public and business policies.","Univ Zulia LUZ, Fac Ciencias Expt, Dept Ciencias Humanas, Zulia, Venezuela",,"Petit, TE (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia LUZ, Fac Ciencias Expt, Dept Ciencias Humanas, Zulia, Venezuela.",elsapetitluzve@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,2,2,1,16,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

[1; 2] Higher education organization is a typical example of the intellectual organization. Since one of the goals of these organizations is in fact knowledge creation and dissemination and intellectual capital approaches have become very important for these organizations. Their investments in these organizations should mainly be invested in human capital and research. The inputs of these organizations and resources and the outputs are intangibles. [3] Intellectual capital management plays an important role in customer equity management, where one of the purposes is to improve customer relationship management or customer loyalty. Customer loyalty is one of the most difficult measurable indicators. So far, the higher education organizations, creating intellectual capital assessment indicators, very little attention have paid to the depth of customer relations and customer relationship quality measurement. However, it should be noted that one of the latest intellectual organizations and institutions including the HEI management concepts are based on the fact that the service quality of the results are very closely related to the provision of client processes [4]. The paper aims to analyze the intellectual capital at higher education organization and emphasizes the role of student loyalty in it. The approach taken is theoretical and based on the combination of three different areas: intellectual capital management, customer relationship management, higher education institution management. The contribution of this paper is an overview of the empirical research previously conducted.

The author will pay attention to position of collective actors in industrial relations: trade unions and employers' associations respectively. For each, the main organisational features and representation of members will be emphasized. A key institution in the relation between unions (workers/employees) and employers (firms/public institutions) is the collective labour agreement. The paper states that national industrial relations regimes remain diverse - mainly between the EU-15 and the 12 New Member States, but also within them in different country groupings. The effect of the current financial and economic crisis on industrial relation arrangements is not yet clear. A description of the trends and variations in industrial conflict will be discussed. The conclusions of the paper will stress that trade unions and employers' organisations were recognised as being major interlocutors for several governments seeking to respond to the crisis. Together with monetary and fiscal stimulus policies, negotiation and consultation involving the social partners have played a significant role in limiting negative social consequences. On the whole, industrial relations in Europe have been vital. In 2010, the Cross-Industry Social Dialogue Committee adopted a joint contribution, that stressed a number of crucial for successful economic recovery objectives: reform of the global financial system, restoring and improving growth dynamics to create more and better jobs, promoting skills and entrepreneurship, revitalising the single market and developing an integrated EU industrial policy among others. The paper will suggest continuing studies of the financial and economic situation in the EU Member countries in 2011-2012 to analyse the role of social dialogue in critical times for the Europe.","[Stacenko, Sergejs] Univ Latvia, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,Sergejs.Stacenko@lu.lv,,,,,,,6,0,0,1,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,647,656,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100058,0

This article synthesizes the theory of exclusionary contracts and applies the theory to a recent antitrust case, Nielsen. We consider an incumbent facing potential entry and contracting with both upstream suppliers and downstream buyers. Focusing first on contracts with downstream buyers, we set out a Chicago benchmark set of assumptions that yields no incentive for exclusionary contracts. Departing from the benchmark in each of three directions yields a theory of exclusion. These include the two existing theories, developed by Aghion and Boulton and by Rasmusen, Ramseyer and Wiley. The structure also captures a third, vertical theory: long-term contracts at one stage of a supply chain can extract rents from a firm with market power at another stage. Turning to upstream contracts, we offer a theory of simultaneous contract offers that generalizes the Colonel Blotto game. Nielsen illustrates the full range of the predictions of the theories of exclusionary contracts.

In the last 15 years, however, some cities discovered the advantages of increasing the cycling share for both life quality and a more sustainable transport system in their cities. This paper focuses on four case studies from the German cities of Munich, Hamburg, Berlin and Frankfurt, and investigates both the development of cycling policies and the changing use of the bicycle as mode of daily transport between 2002 and 2008 in these cities. By analysing policy documents, web sources and national travel data, we show (1) that the often claimed increase of cycling usage in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin is supported, and (2) identify the implementation and strengthening of policies to promote cycling by the local government as crucial for these successes. These findings are supported by our fourth case study, Hamburg, where we were not able to identify an increased bicycle usage in this time period, where cycling promoting policies were adapted by the local government only in 2008 and, thus, effects can only be expected after 2008. Our findings support that, although local cycling policies are not the only factor for successfully increasing cycling usage, they play a crucial role in the process of increasing cycling use in cities. Both, cycling infrastructure improvements and communication campaigns, initiated, supported and executed by the local government, are key factors for increasing bicycle use in cities.

This paper uses the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 to 2011 to test whether couples that engage in less specialization (are more similar in hours of market work) spend more time together. We find that among married couples without young children, those with a greater difference in weekly hours of work between husband and wife spend less time together on non-working weekend days. Importantly, we find that this relationship is quite symmetric between couples in which the husband works greater hours and couples in which the wife works greater hours. We do not find evidence of a relationship between specialization and couple time together among couples with young children.","[Mansour, Hani] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Mansour, Hani] IZA, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [McKinnish, Terra] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Mansour, H (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, CB 181,POB 173364, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",hani.mansour@ucdenver.edu; terra.mckinnish@colorado.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD066613] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,16,13,14,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

These are linear combinations of the response shares, i.e., the percentage share of the respondents who answered up minus the percentage share of those who answered down. Forecasters traditionally use these indices for short-term business cycle forecasting. Survey response shares can also be combined non-linearly into alternative indices, using the Carlson-Parkin method. Using IFO and ISM data, this paper tests the relative performance of Carlson-Parkin type indices versus balance indices for the shortterm forecasting of industrial production growth. The main finding is that the two types of indices show no difference in forecasting performance during the Great Moderation. However, the Carlson-Parkin type indices outperform the balance indices during periods with higher output volatilities, such as before and after the Great Moderation.

Graphical presentation illustrates a strong declining trend in same day trips over the period from 2001 to 2011, which may be associated with the enhanced security regime at the border in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. However other factors, including a strengthening Canadian dollar and slow economic growth after 2008 may also contribute to this trend. Regression analysis is used to identify factors affecting cross-border flows in both directions for both single day and multi-day trips. A parallel analysis is done for the flows to and from the Province of Ontario only. Results indicate that even after controlling for exchange rates and economic performance, a significant negative impact of 9/11 can be detected. A counterfactual exercise suggests that a quite dramatic reduction in vehicle crossings in both directions may be attributed to 9/11. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Umbrella effects arise irrespective of whether non-cartelists act as price takers (competitive fringe) or respond strategically to the increased demand. Sizable umbrella effects can also arise when non-cartelists are outside the relevant market, as defined by the hypothetical monopolist test (HMT), provided that the cartel's price increase is substantial. Further, a shift of demand to non-cartelists can also occur when firms that purchase products or inputs from the cartelists pass on the price increase to their rivals that purchase from non-cartelists, who may benefit from higher demand. To identify the actual damage of umbrella effects, it is thus key to take into account the overall adjustments among cartel members and outsiders, as well as among their respective, potentially competing purchasers. We also discuss how future analysis of the endogenous formation of cartels with partial market coverage should inform theories of the determinants of umbrella effects.","[Inderst, Roman] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Maier-Rigaud, Frank P.] Paris LEM CNRS, SEG Sch Management, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Paris, France; [Maier-Rigaud, Frank P.; Schwalbe, Ulrich] NERA Econ Consulting, Brussels, Belgium; [Schwalbe, Ulrich] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, Stuttgart, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University Hohenheim,"Inderst, R (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",inderst@finance.uni-frankfurt.de; frank.maier-rigaud@nera.com; ulrich.schwalbe@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,36,14,14,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

We first consider the fundamental underlying premise of the arbitration proposal-namely, that there are systemic problems relating to FRAND-based standardization and that current disputes are not being efficiently addressed.

The usual answer looks like Pascal's wager: we don't know whether God exists; who erroneously believes loses nothing, who correctly believes wins everything; who correctly disbelieves, gains nothing, who erroneously disbelieves loses everything. Believing is thus a dominant choice. Turned to finance: markets are efficient or not. In an efficient market forecasters and non-forecasters win nothing; in a non- efficient market forecasters win and non-forecasters lose. Forecasting is rational if inefficiencies have a probability > 0. We use an agent-based approach in studying the information value in a market with endogenous prices. We show that in inefficient markets rational traders don't make forecasts and an improvement in public information may even be harmful for the users.

The recently revised Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines contain such a change, as the document recognizes the importance of Critical Loss Analysis in defining a market but introduces a theoretical construct to control the analysis. This approach imposes a structure based on the economist's Lerner index and then applies a specific style of diversion analysis to compute the actual loss to a hypothetical price increase. We show that this methodology almost guarantees narrow markets, a change that could support a very significant increase in the level of merger enforcement. However, we also show how this aggressive policy result depends on specific assumptions that are often not justified. Change these assumptions, and the traditional implications of a Critical Loss Analysis are restored. The recent Department of Justice (DOJ) challenge of H& R Block's proposed acquisition of the TaxACT software is used to illustrate the problem. Unjustified theoretical assumptions allowed the DOJ's expert economist to testify to a narrow market that virtually guaranteed that the merger would be found anticompetitive. In effect, theory, if allowed to control market definition analysis, would significantly reduce the plaintiff's burden of proof and expand the potential for merger enforcement.","[Simons, Joseph J.; Coate, Malcolm B.] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Simons, Joseph J.] Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Competit, Washington, DC USA",,"Simons, JJ (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA.",jsimons@paulweiss.com; mcoate@ftc.gov,,,,,,,53,3,3,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a market for balancing has not emerged in the Dutch electricity industry, and that, instead, the balancing transactions are governed by regulated, long-term contracts and a bidding mechanism. We explain the absence of a balancing market by using the framework of transaction cost economics, in which the efficiency of a market decreases with increasing investments in specific assets. The results of a questionnaire among the energy firms that supply balancing power in the Dutch setting show that these firms have invested in specific physical, temporal and dedicated balancing assets. The need for these specific investments to balance supply and demand does not only explain the absence of a market, but also the lack of participation by small firms in the balancing mechanism. We recommend several policies, such as stimulating technological developments for the storage of electricity and demand side management, which reduce these specific investments in balancing assets, and thereby stimulate the creation of a market and the participation of small firms.","[Niesten, Eva] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Jolink, Albert] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Niesten, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",E.M.M.I.Niesten@uu.nl; ajolink@rsm.nl,"Jolink, Albert/AAA-9417-2022; Niesten, Eva/AAA-8849-2022","Jolink, Albert/0000-0002-8823-1748; Niesten, Eva/0000-0002-9497-7263",,,,,42,2,2,3,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

However, hotspot maps are often created over a single timescale using only one crime type. In the case of short-term hotspot maps that utilize several weeks of crime data, risk estimates suffer from a high variance, especially for low frequency crimes such as homicide. Long-term hotspot maps that utilize several years of data fail to take into account near-repeat effects and emerging hotspot trends. In this paper we show how point process models of crime can be extended to include leading indicator crime types, while capturing both short-term and long-term patterns of risk, through a marked point process approach. Several years of data and many different crime types are systematically combined to yield accurate hotspot maps that can be used for the purpose of predictive policing of gun-related crime.

The use of negotiated settlements is closely linked with the shift toward a more regulatory conception of competition law, however, and thus away from the orthodox antitrust paradigm. This article examines Commission practices to date under the commitment procedure, arguing that the enhanced flexibility and remedial choices available under Article 9 reflect characteristics more usually associated with the regulatory model. In view of the conventional criticisms of antitrust-as-regulation, the article furthermore considers the extent to which these regulatory attributes of the commitment procedure are problematic in practice, given that regulatory competition law does not incorporate the typical safeguards of ordinary regulation. The article concludes that, although the quasi-regulatory nature of commitment decisions is indisputable, its implications are more mixed. The increased effectiveness of Article 9, both as a means of alleviating market problems and of case disposition, must therefore be balanced against certain legitimacy and longer-term efficiency concerns.","[Dunne, Niamh] Fitzwilliam Coll, Cambridge, England; [Dunne, Niamh] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Dunne, N (通讯作者)，Fitzwilliam Coll, Cambridge, England.",nd266@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,105,24,25,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Critical loss and diversion ratio analyses attempt to model the implications of mergers on competition and antitrust market definition in differentiated markets, and have been a major focus over the last decade by authors such as Michael Katz and Carl Shapiro. James Langenfeld and Wenqing Li, and Oystein Daljord, Lars Sorgard, and Oyvind Thomassen, derive the critical loss formula when the price of only one differentiated product is raised due to a merger. However, they arrive at different results. This article corrects the derivation in Daljord, Sorgard, and Thomassen, and provides the appropriate formula of critical loss with asymmetric price. It then shows how failure to correct Daljord, Sorgard, and Thomassen's formulation of critical loss can lead to incorrect conclusions about market definition and competitive effects in merger analysis, resulting in antitrust markets that tend to be too broad.","[Langenfeld, James] Loyola Univ, Chicago Sch Law, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Li, Wenqing] Navigant Econ, Chicago, IL USA",Loyola University New Orleans,"Langenfeld, J (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ, Chicago Sch Law, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",james.langenfeld@naviganteconomics.com; wenqing.li@naviganteconomics.com,,,,,,,9,2,4,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The main challenge is how to act in multi-echelon supply chains considering the levels involved. Making a choice independently or integrating with some or all levels will be a critical decision, and therefore affects the overall profit of the chain. This article proposes a non-cooperative game theory approach to helping in making a better decision in the supply chain and gaining the most accessible benefit. Our research considers unlimited three-echelon supply chains with S suppliers, M manufacturers and K retailers. The Nash equilibrium and definition are used bearing in mind inventory and pricing and marketing cost as decision variables for this matter. This paper studies a three-echelon supply chain network and focuses on the value of integrating a pair of partners in the chain. In the decentralized case, the supplier sets its own price, the manufacturer points out order quantity, wholesale price and backorder quantity, and the retailer charges the final retail price of the product and marketing product. Though there are multiple players at a single echelon level, each manufacturer supplies only a specific product to a given retailer. In addition to the decentralized case, two integration scenarios have been taken into account: manufacturer-retailer and supplier-manufacturer. As for manufacturer-retailer integration, inventory/holding cost issues diminish to a single warehouse and the retailer does not have to enforce marketing effort any more. Supplier-manufacturer integration brings similar benefits. Under each scenario, all parties involved simultaneously set their strategies. Through a numerical experiment, 17 design cases (through designing experiments) have been developed and the total profit of the supply chain under each scenario has been evaluated. Statistical tests on the above introduced 17 experiments have found that the decentralized system performs significantly worse than the integration of the supplier with the manufacturer, whereas no significant difference can be observed regarding other combinations.","[Mandiraji, Hannan Amoozad] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Management, Kashan Branch, Kashan, Iran; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kaziumieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Management, Kashan Branch, Kashan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; University of Southern Denmark; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Islamic Azad University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, Vilnius, Lithuania.",h.amoozad@ut.ac.ir; gov@sam.sdu.dk; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; s.hossein.r@gmail.com,"Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/AAT-9996-2020; Govindan, Kannan/M-5996-2017; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/0000-0002-8382-6603; Govindan, Kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,55,23,23,0,29,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Specifically, winners choose round numbers to avoid any miscommunication when they announce their planned bids to other ring members, and losers prefer round numbers when they arbitrarily bid above the winning bid. We find that (1) there is a positive relationship between the roundness of a bid and its relative value as a fraction of the reserve price, (2) the roundness of bids is higher when collusion is active than when it is inactive, (3) among the ring bids, the roundness of the lowest bids is even higher than that of the other bids, and (4) bids by non-ring members are also round when collusion is active.","Shiga Univ, Dept Econ, Hikone, Shiga, Japan",Shiga University,"Ishii, R (通讯作者)，Shiga Univ, Dept Econ, Bamba 1-1-1, Hikone, Shiga, Japan.",rie-ishii@biwako.shiga-u.ac.jp,"Ishii, Rieko/GSD-2583-2022; Ishii, Rieko/AAF-8732-2021","Ishii, Rieko/0000-0001-8397-377X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730204, 22243022] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,18,18,19,3,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Air pollution in port cities that has resulted from the intense expansion of ports has become a pressing concern. Although several studies have discussed the relationship between port and city functions and a few studies have attempted to consider ports' environmental performance using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, none have examined emerging port city issues like their environmental influence in great detail. To address these gaps, a slacks-based data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) model was used in this paper to assess the environmental efficiency of port cities. The labor population in respective port cities was selected as the input variable, and gross regional domestic product (GRDP) and container throughput were used as the desirable output variables. As the undesirable output variables, nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were selected in the model. The results showed that Singapore, Busan, Rotterdam, Kaohsiung, Antwerp, and New York are the most environmentally efficient port cities, while Tianjin is the least environmentally efficient. The social and opportunity costs for air pollutants emissions in low efficient port cities were calculated as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The forecasts are for the current and the following year, and comprise an unbalanced three-dimensional panel with multiple individual forecasters, target years, and forecast horizons. The fixed-event nature of the forecasts enables us to examine their efficiency by looking at the revision process. The panel structure allows us to control for aggregate shocks and to construct a measure of the news that impacted expectations in the period under study. We find that respondents anchor to their initial forecasts, updating their revisions smoothly as they receive more information. In addition, they do not seem to use publicly-known information in an efficient manner. These inefficiencies suggest clear areas of opportunity for improving the accuracy of the forecasts, for instance by taking into account the positive autocorrelation found in forecast revisions.

However, the severity indicators concerning vans have not improved as favorably as those of other types of vehicles, such as passenger cars and heavy freight transport vehicles. This study is intended to analyze the main factors explaining van accident behavior and to get a further insight into dynamic macro models for road accidents. For this purpose we are using four time series related to the frequency and severity of van accidents on Spanish roads and two types of methodologies applied in the study of traffic accidents: linear regression with Box-Cox transformed variables and autoregressive errors (DRAG), and an unobserved components model (UCM). The four response time series modeled are the number of fatal accidents, the number of accidents with seriously injured victims, the number of fatalities and the number of seriously injured victims. Since the choice of the appropriate macro model for the analysis of road traffic accidents is not a trivial matter, we are considering multiple factors such as goodness of fit and interpretation, as well as the prediction accuracy in order to choose the best model. Overall, the final results make sense and agree with the literature as far as the elasticities and coefficient signs are concerned. It was found that the DRAG-type model yields slightly better predictions for all four models compared to UCM. With these macroeconomic models, the effect of some influential factors (fleet, drivers, exposure variables, economic factors, as well as legislative actions) can be addressed. Estimating the effect of the vigilance and surveillance actions can help safety authorities in their policy evaluation and in the allocation of resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a unified framework of evaluation to adequately address the specifities of public transport. This framework suggests that efficiency issues are the most studied, primarily dealing with various aspects of service production with a managerial perspective. More recently, customer-related quality issues have received greater attention in the literature. However, the point of view of policy makers does not necessarily coincide with either any of these two perspectives. Related transport policy effectiveness issues - such as variations in total emissions of pollutants or other social benefits due to improved transit - have been less consistently studied and need to be pushed up in the research agenda. The framework that we followed to map the existing literature allows also a partial correction where there was confusion in the examination of effectiveness issues, due to an overlapping of the points of view of users and decision makers. Finally, on the basis of our classification, the paper proposes a set of effectiveness indicators to properly evaluate the contribution of transit to the broader functioning of transport systems according to accessibility, modal diversion and environmental impacts.","[Diana, Marco] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Ingn Ambiente Terr & Infrastrutture, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Daraio, Cinzia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gest Antonio, Rome, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Sapienza University Rome,"Diana, M (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Ingn Ambiente Terr & Infrastrutture, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",marco.diana@polito.it,"Diana, Marco/H-4897-2012",,,,,,88,6,7,0,12,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

For sustainability, trains are preferred to private cars. Two key variables affecting door-to-door train travel time are in-vehicle time (IVT) and headway; however, there is often a trade-off between speed and frequency in a system. If different categories of travellers value IVT and headway differently, their proportions on a route should affect traffic planning. Optimal system design might differ between routes carrying many commuters and routes carrying mainly passengers on single private or business trips. Knowledge of differences in relative valuations of headway versus IVT should therefore affect railway system design. We investigate whether the relative values of headway versus IVT differ between inter-urban commuting by train and single inter-urban trips by train, whilst also examining differences between socioeconomic groups. Stated choice (SC) data from 580 Swedish respondents are used in estimation. Individuals actually commuting and individuals not commuting but imagining that they are when answering the SC questions are asked about their preferences for headway versus IVT. Commuters are estimated to value increased headway 19 percentage points more than do non-commuters. Young people (under age 21 years) value headway more than do older people while people with children value headway less than do the childless.","[Holmgren, Johan] Linkoping Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, Div Commun & Transport Syst, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Ivehammar, Pernilla] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Div Econ, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Holmgren, J (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, Div Commun & Transport Syst, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",Johan.holm-gren@liu.se; pernilla.ivehammar@liu.se,,"Holmgren, Johan/0000-0002-2566-4183",,,,,25,0,0,0,10,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

For the period from 2000 to 2009, we find that non-stop fares were on average about 21 percent lower post-entry; however, the magnitude of the price effect depends on the pre-entry market structure. While entry into monopoly markets triggered an average price decrease of about 25 percent, the respective average price drop for entries into oligopoly markets lied at about 15 percent.

For that purpose, we collected data related to the municipal budgets and business results of entrepreneurs registered in 427 municipalities during 2007-2011 period. In order to determine and study the variations in municipal economic outcomes related to the size of municipalities, their administrative status (municipalities belonging to the areas of state national concern, hill and mountain areas, and island areas), their geographic location and dominant political party in the municipality, we apply multivariate statistics methods (Levene's test of variance homogeneity, ANOVA, and Sheffe post-hoc test). The results suggest that size of the municipalities explains the variation related to municipal fiscal capacity and average net earnings of inhabitants living in municipalities. The political affiliation of a mayor is related to the differences in the relative amount of aid granted from the central government budget, fiscal capacity and indebtness, while the differences in administrative status of municipalities account for discrepancies observed in employment, average net earnings, indebtedness, central government aid, and expenditures for social protection. The basic conclusion of research is that Croatian municipalities differ significantly in the majority of the analyzed economic determinants and that current administrative status should be subject to the general local government reform, not only in special status and number of local units but also in fiscal equalization process.","[Bakaric, Ivana Rasic; Vizek, Maruska] Inst Econ Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Simovic, Hrvoje] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Vizek, Maruska] Zagreb Sch Econ & Management, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Bakaric, IR (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Zagreb, JF Kennedy Sq 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",irasic@eizg.hr; hsimovic@efzg.hr; mvizek@eizg.hr,"Simovic, Hrvoje/H-7676-2018","Simovic, Hrvoje/0000-0002-4040-0899",,,,,34,4,4,0,11,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Conversely, it is suggested that non-cluster firms are more likely to avoid cluster destinations in their FDIs. Second, it is hypothesized that cluster networks generate connections between city-regions in different countries that are horizontal and vertical in character and thus shape global city-region networks.

Most of the attention in the paper is paid to the readiness of entrepreneurs jointly with municipalities to participate in the preparation of future qualified specialists. Co-operation among various educational establishments, the local government and the employers is crucial. A much neglected aspect still is the co-operation between VET and higher education (HE) institutions - which the authors see as a real driving force for the success of local partnerships to promote regional economic development with respective training of modern labour force at all levels. For the empirical research focus group discussions with public administration representatives, educators and entrepreneurs, as well as survey of entrepreneurs was used. The aim of the empirical study was to investigate the employers' opinions and readiness at regional level to support the learners - the future labour force. The discussion on 'common language' was initiated at the focus group discussion. This requires further investigation for application at regional level with the involvement of all the relevant stakeholders. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Results revealed a significant negative relationship between green management practices and CEO base pay, however, there was not a significant relationship between green management practices and CEO bonuses. In line with previous agency theory research, findings suggest a negative relationship between state regulation and CEO compensation in green states.

This paper is focused on support for the forestry sector from the EU funds in the years 2004-2006 in two EU Member States Czech Republic (CZ) and Slovakia (SK). The comparison of support for forestry activities from the EU funds, delivered through the implementation of National Operational Programmes, showed differences at country level. Both countries had the opportunity to apply for support based on common EU policy, but they were able to select measures that reflected their specific needs and priorities at national level. Within Operational Programmes the following indicators were evaluated: description of forestry measures, financial support, number of applications, beneficiaries, outcomes and impacts. The comparison of financial support showed that the greater part of support in SK was granted to non-profit investments, whereas in CZ into profit making investments. The main difference was in the interest shown by applicants for support. In CZ nearly 80% of submitted applications were approved compared to 59% in SK. The analysis showed that the main reason for differences in utilisation of available sources was that different principles were applied when selecting supported measures or defining the activities to be supported within the measure.

Primary data were collected using a survey of 18 PE funds that invest or have considered investing in Angola, followed by 10 expert interviews to gain deeper insight into the country's institutional and economic environment, and its potential for PE investments. It is found that most PE funds are attracted to Angola by its rapid economic growth and high potential returns. The country is also vastly undersupplied, and many key economic sectors are fast developing, presenting exciting opportunities for investors. Nevertheless, PE in Angola remains limited, mainly owing to the difficulty of doing business in Angola, and owing particularly to the unfavourable regulatory environment. There is no regulation or process when it comes to the registration of PE funds in Angola, and any new regulation that applies to foreign investments is marred by unnecessary red tape, making it difficult for the investment to enter the market. Only two funds are authorised to operate in Angola: Fundo de Investimento Privado de Angola (FIPA), and BESA Activ. Streamlining regulation is critical to increasing PE flows to Angola in order to advance the country's economic and social objectives.","[Jover, Estefania] McKinsey & Co Inc, Luanda, Angola; [Mlambo, Chipo] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Jover, E (通讯作者)，McKinsey & Co Inc, Luanda, Angola.",,,,,,,,50,0,0,1,11,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The large spatial separation requires intensified bulk transportation of coal to balance the coal supply and demand, and thus adds extra burden on transportation. In this paper, the option of transporting coal by electrons is investigated. A spatial equilibrium (SE) model is constructed to assess the effect of the policy scenario on the Chinese steam coal markets. Analysis shows that large-scale investments into HVDC transmission lines and coal-fired power plants close to the mines yield mostly positive economic effects and increase aggregate social welfare. Promoting domestic HVDC transmissions would be a significant option for Chinese steam coal transportation.","[Liu Xiuying; Lin Xiaoyan] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Liu, XY (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",liu_xiuying11@163.com,"Liu, Xiu/IYJ-9134-2023; Liu, Xiufang/I-8003-2015",,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-8-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,455,459,,,,,,5,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358894900075,0

Companies have been outsourcing non-core services or functions for many years. Outsourcing of IT management picked up in the late 80's and since then it has mushroomed into a multi-billion dollar industry. Initially the key driver for outsourcing was controlling operational expenses but over the period of time several other factors have been prominent such as flexibility in control of investments and resources, risk sharing, acquisition of special skills and competencies, revenue sharing, establishing long term strategic relationship, etc. The decision of outsourcing attaches special significance in the strategy formulation in the company or any operation. Large numbers of research papers have been published in the past two decades on outsourcing and researchers have studied and analyzed various internal and external factors having bearing on outsourcing decision. Over a period of time new business models and frameworks have emerged helping decision makers in the process. Some researchers have adopted research methodologies that are case studies based or while others have designed empirical formulations by conducting extensive surveys. Interestingly most conclusions from these studies tend to converge on similar set of key factors. This paper provides detailed review of the published research body of knowledge on outsourcing IT management and explores relevance to telecom operations. In the case of telecom operators, it is observed that the basic set of parameters influencing the decision of outsourcing is same as rest of the industry. In the recent past, it is observed that telecom operators have extended this model by outsourcing management of network infrastructure, management of towers, billing systems, marketing, etc. This is creating new working models and relationships. The paper concludes by providing the direction for the future research work in this domain (c) 2014 The Authors.

We measure the value of model sophistication in terms of dollar losses by considering a set of 444 multivariate models that differ in their specification of the conditional variance, conditional correlation, innovation distribution, and estimation approach. All of the models belong to the dynamic conditional correlation class, which is particularly suitable because it allows consistent estimations of the risk neutral dynamics with a manageable amount of computational effort for relatively large scale problems. It turns out that increasing the sophistication in the marginal variance processes (i.e., nonlinearity, asymmetry and component structure) leads to important gains in pricing accuracy. Enriching the model with more complex existing correlation specifications does not improve the performance significantly. Estimating the standard dynamic conditional correlation model by composite likelihood, in order to take into account potential biases in the parameter estimates, generates only slightly better results. To enhance this poor performance of correlation models, we propose a new model that allows for correlation spillovers without too many parameters. This model performs about 60% better than the existing correlation models we consider. Relaxing a Gaussian innovation for a Laplace innovation assumption improves the pricing in a more minor way. In addition to investigating the value of model sophistication in terms of dollar losses directly, we also use the model confidence set approach to statistically infer the set of models that delivers the best pricing performances.

A consumer surplus analysis is used to determine the welfare loss to individuals who undertake travel-to-work trips in the Dublin and the Western Border Region (WBR) of Ireland. Three CO2 price scenarios are analysed: a low, medium and high carbon price. These results are compared at an aggregate level for each electoral division to existing measures of deprivation derived from the Census 2006 to determine if electoral wards designated as relatively deprived also incur the largest welfare losses. The results are also compared to the density of population in each electoral division to investigate any link between density levels and welfare changes, particularly in rural regions. The welfare model found a significant divergence in the changes in consumer surplus between both the study regions. While welfare changes were minimal in the low price scenario, divergences occurred in the medium and high price scenarios as individuals using more sustainable modes in urban areas benefited from the higher market price. Large welfare losses were found in the more rural WBR whilst most areas in Dublin were found to experience a welfare gain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The reforms did not apply to all firms and resulted in treatment and control groups of firms with overlapping characteristics. A difference-in-difference approach (controlling for various factors including firm-specific time trends) shows a substantial positive causal effect of the reforms in combination with the 2004 sanction increase. A regression discontinuity analysis, focusing on the thresholds for application of the reforms, leads to similar results. Across various specifications, the estimated effect is at least 6% of firm value. This effect is large, but comparable in magnitude to effects found in other studies of major corporate governance reforms, especially in emerging markets.","[Dharmapala, Dhammika] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Khanna, Vikramaditya] Univ Michigan, Sch Law, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Dharmapala, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",dharmap@illinois.edu; vskhanna@umich.edu,"Dharmapala, Dhammika/GPF-9205-2022","Dharmapala, Dhammika/0000-0001-9858-0565",,,,,23,47,49,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The analysis builds on the experimental evaluations of three programs implemented in rural areas: Mexico's Programa Nacional de Educacin, Salud y Alimentacin (PROGRESA), Nicaragua's Red de Proteccin Social, and Honduras' Programa de Asignacin Familiar. Comparable results for the three countries indicate that the effects that the programs have had on the labor supply of participating adults have been mostly negative but are nonetheless small and not statistically significant. However, the evidence does point to the presence of other effects on labor markets. In the case of PROGRESA, there is a small positive effect on the number of hours worked by female beneficiaries and a sizeable increase in wages among male beneficiaries and a resulting increase in household labor income. Moreover, PROGRESA seems to have reduced female labor-force participation in ineligible households. These results imply that large-scale interventions may have broader equilibrium effects.","[Laura Alzua, Maria; Cruces, Guillermo] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ, Ctr Estudios Distribut Laborales & Sociales, CEDLAS, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina; [Laura Alzua, Maria; Cruces, Guillermo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cruces, Guillermo] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Ripani, Laura] IDB, Labor Markets & Social Secur Unit LMK, Washington, DC 20577 USA",National University of La Plata; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); IZA Institute Labor Economics; Inter-American Development Bank,"Cruces, G (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ, Ctr Estudios Distribut Laborales & Sociales, CEDLAS, Calle 6 777, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina.",gcruces@cedlas.org,,"Cruces, Guillermo/0000-0002-1965-5897",,,,,65,56,66,3,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Hypothetical moral dilemmas are used in order to probe moral intuitions. Philosophers use them to achieve a reflective equilibrium between intuitions and principles, psychologists to investigate moral decision-making processes. In the dilemmas, the harms that are traded off are almost always deaths. However, the moral principles and psychological processes are supposed to be broader than this, encompassing harms other than death. Further, if the standard pattern of intuitions is preserved in the domain of economic harm, then that would open up the possibility of studying behaviour in trolley problems using the tools of experimental economics. We report the results of two studies designed to test whether the standard patterns of intuitions are preserved when the domain and severity of harm are varied. Our findings show that the difference in moral intuitions between bystander and footbridge scenarios is replicated across different domains and levels of physical and non-physical harm, including economic harms.","[Gold, Natalie] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Pulford, Briony D.; Colman, Andrew M.] Univ Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Leicester,"Gold, N (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England.",natalie.gold@rocketmail.com,"Colman, Andrew M./A-3322-2008; Colman, Andrew M./CBO-8743-2022; Pulford, Briony D./C-1709-2009","Colman, Andrew M./0000-0003-0499-3479; Colman, Andrew M./0000-0003-0499-3479; Gold, Natalie/0000-0003-0706-1618; Pulford, Briony D./0000-0001-8636-9957",AHRC [AH/H001158/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/H001158/1] Funding Source: researchfish,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,31,18,22,2,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

For the period after 1984, the existing empirical evidence largely suggests that the likelihood of predicting inflation accurately using macroeconomic indicators is no better than a random walk model. We expand the scope of inflation predictability by exploring whether macroeconomic indicators are useful in predicting the distribution of inflation. We consider six commonly-used macro indicators and core/non-core versions of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) deflator as measures of inflation. Based on monthly data and for the forecast period after 1984, we find that some of the macro indicators, such as the unemployment rate, housing starts and the term spread, provide significant out-of-sample predictability for the distribution of core inflation. An analysis of the quantiles of the predictive distribution reveals interesting patterns which would otherwise be ignored by existing inflation forecasting approaches that rely only on forecasting the mean. We also illustrate the importance of inflation distribution forecasting in evaluating some events which are of policy interest by focusing on predicting the likelihood of deflation.

It remains an open question of whether these effects of early childhood conditions arise due to divorce laws raising the likelihood of parental marital disruption or whether unilateral divorce laws also affect children in intact marriages by changing intra-household bargaining. Using recently available data from SHARELIFE for 11 Western European countries, we address this question employing a difference-in-differences approach and controlling for childhood family structure and socioeconomic status. Like previous research, we find adverse effects of growing up under unilateral divorce laws on the well-being of children. This effect remains even when controlling for childhood variables.

Using data from the March 2010 Current Population Survey (CPS), we examine health care coverage at the state level prior to the ACA and forecast the percentage of state residents eligible for expanded Medicaid and the exchanges. Our results suggest the percentage of state population eligible for expanded Medicaid and subsidized exchanges will vary considerably, especially for adults. Further, we show that current state Medicaid eligibility rules, the percentage of employers offering health insurance and poverty rates will continue to shape the variation in projected health insurance coverage across the states.

This paper studies the imposition of antidumping duties in the cement industry and finds striking regional variation in their impact on domestic prices, sales and imports. Duties that were imposed on Japanese producers that were shipping cement to the US West-Coast coastal markets led to imperfect substitution to other imports, which allowed domestic prices and production to increase. Imperfect substitution also occurred following duties that were imposed on Mexican producers that were shipping cement to the US Gulf of Mexico coastal markets. But in the US Southwest border markets, the same duties had no impact on the domestic prices of cement. I link the variation in responses across regions to hysteresis that was due to high exit costs.","Compass Lexecon, Oakland, CA 94607 USA",,"Cohen-Meidan, M (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon, 1111 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607 USA.",mmeidan@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,24,3,4,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The latter differs among individuals and evolves endogenously via cultural transmission mechanisms in which children's preferences are partly shaped by divorce decisions of their parents. In turn, divorce law is chosen by majority voting. The dynamics of the economy may exhibit multiple long-run equilibria. Economic shocks can destabilize the low-divorce equilibrium: through cultural evolutions, divorce rates increase and divorce law may be modified. In compliance with stylized facts, the results show that legal changes occurred after that divorce rates had started to rise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It develops a model in which firms have private information about their type-represented by their probability of having a high-quality product-and can acquire additional private information about their product quality through costly testing and learning. Penalties for false claims and for unsubstantiated claims create an opportunity for firms to credibly reveal their information and for signaling to emerge in equilibrium. I show that the two kinds of penalties affect the possibility of signaling in different ways and that the mandatory substantiation requirement in many circumstances improves buyer information and social welfare beyond what is achieved by a ban on false claims alone.,"Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Corts, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,"Corts, Kenneth/KCJ-7518-2024","Corts, Kenneth Stevens/0009-0006-8146-3286",,,,,20,18,18,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

In order to determine the forecasts of detailed vehicular fleets, those comprise the overall car stock and their associated pollutant emissions and fuel demand, specific curves of retirement models were used in addition to econometric analysis. To obtain forecasts for the year 2015, this methodology was applied to the Mexico City Metropolitan Area case using data since 1990. The validation of the models applied was done through economic data from 2004, 2006 and 2008. The results of the forecasts carried out displayed high confidence levels, above 95% for the medium term. The exercise with the forecasted fleets produced an expected increase of around 21% of criteria pollutants and 31% in greenhouse gases emissions due to vehicular activity, from 2007 to 2015. Further, an increase in fuel demand of around 22.9% gasoline and 27.1% diesel in the same period was estimated, which are lower than those officially projected. Finally, a specific coefficient beta to the Gompertz equation applied to Mexico City case Was obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using natural experiments from U.S. News and World Report College Rankings, we present two main findings. First, we identify a causal impact of rankings on application decisions. When explicit rankings of colleges are published in U.S. News, a one-rank improvement leads to a 1-percentage-point increase in the number of applications to that college. Second, we show that the response to the information represented in rankings depends on the way in which that information is presented. Rankings have no effect on application decisions when colleges are listed alphabetically, even when readers are provided data on college quality and the methodology used to calculate rankings. This finding provides evidence that the salience of information is a central determinant of a firm's demand function, even for purchases as large as college attendance.","[Luca, Michael] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Smith, Jonathan] Coll Board, Advocacy & Policy Ctr, Washington, DC USA",Harvard University,"Luca, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Soldiers Field Rd, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",mluca@hbs.edu; jsmith@collegeboard.org,,,,,,,13,88,119,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

In the long term, firms tend to idle even more when their projects require more attention and also when they have acquired less attention capacity. We discuss briefly how the model can be tested. Moreover, natural model extensions suggest that managers who want to signal higher quality or who are overly optimistic take on too many projects.

The new design that must be undertaken is a reduction in the traditional institutional functionalism to enter greater institutional synergies where each manager must provide leadership and guidance for the entire company or specific project. This means that we will need a new human resources policy. According to D. H. Pink (Pink, 2010) it is necessary to develop intrinsic motivation, economic incentives are no longer valid in changing environments where it is necessary to develop innovation and creativity. It is also necessary that companies that succeed give more value to social interaction among workers, invest more in training and encourage communication and cooperation. Taking this in account we have undertaken an empirical analyse in order to know the level of integration and satisfaction in the company and predisposition for undertaken a change process. A survey was conducted. The survey was structured in six dimensions and included 370 variables. It is also important to mention that this paper's analysis was based on each individual's perspective and appreciation, not based on third party perspectives. Some of the previous result is that individual's identification with the company is not as high as individual's identification with the job itself.

The core of determining the purposefulness of new service development is assessing and comparing two trends of service business development: new service implementation and the main alternative of this process - the expansion of the scope of the current services. The paper demonstrates how the authors consolidate, annotate and critique available research on some logical aspects of new service development in order to find more objective quantitative decisions. The study provides the methodology (process model) of determining the purposefulness of new service development. A new attitude is evidenced by discovering quantitative assessment according to different sets of criteria. The paper also improves the comprehension of the complex process of new service implementation - proves the necessity of the first step, i.e. the determination of the purposefulness of a new service, which is often missed by authors. Appropriate solutions, according to the results of the suggested quantitative analysis, would increase the objectivity of assessment and the probability of successful new services.","[Drejeris, Rolandas; Bivainis, Juozas; Tuncikiene, Zivile] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Social Econ & Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Drejeriene, Egle] Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Med Acad, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, LT-44307 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Lithuanian University of Health Sciences,"Drejeris, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Social Econ & Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rolandas.drejeris@vgtu.lt; juozas.bivainis@vgtu.lt; zivile.tuncikiene@vgtu.lt; edrejeriene@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,9,9,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We seek to better understand the reasons behind park-and-ride provision by estimating a logit model that predicts the presence of parking at a set of new light rail stations across the US. In terms of station area attributes, this model demonstrates a relatively predictable pattern, with parking facilities more frequently occurring in lower density environments where land is cheap and available. After controlling for station attributes, certain transit operators exhibit a greater propensity to provide park-and-ride facilities (e.g., those that serve multiple jurisdictions, have large service areas, and rely heavily on local funding). Further, parking provision also varies based on the characteristics of the municipality in which the station is located. Stations within municipalities that use mayor-council forms of government, for example, are more likely to include parking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate least-cost combinations of CWD-increasing measures in a spruce-dominated Swedish forest estate. Specifically, we investigate how using combinations of the measures tree retention, creating high stumps, manual scarification, prolonged rotations, and retention of dying trees impacts the amount of CWD and net present value at the estate level. We found that by combining CWD-increasing measures in an optimal way the amount of CWD on the estate could be increased 322% with a decrease in present value of only 10%. The optimal combination of conservation measures depends on the desired increase in CWD. The analysis thus shows that huge improvements in cost-efficiency of biodiversity-oriented forestry are possible.

However, despite recent progress and its undeniable merit, the BSC has its own shortcomings. As reported in the literature, it seems generally agreed that the way compensations between criteria within a BSC framework are calculated remains an open issue. Thus, one of the contributions of this study is to augment the theoretical discussion on the potentialities of the multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to bring simplicity and transparency to the calculation of compensations (i.e. trade-offs) among evaluation criteria within a BSC framework. It seems important to underline that this paper builds on previous work and is not empirical research. However, it aims to extend the discussion to other (new) measurement contexts. We believe that the development and promotion of the integrated use of MCDA tools in BSC applications to measure trade-offs among evaluation criteria in the BSC framework can be a key factor in ensuring more successful implementations and uses of the BSC within firms.","[Ferreira, Fernando A.

This paper attempts to address the possible policy measures to reduce the energy consumption and mitigate the harmful emissions, especially greenhouse gas (GHG) from China's road transportation sector. Five scenarios, which assess electric or/and hybrid vehicles, are designed and examined to estimate the potentials for reducing consumption and emissions. It is concluded that comprehensive and appropriate strategies be promoted to minimize the adverse impacts of China's road vehicles on energy demand and environmental sustainability. For future policy implementation, it is appropriate to promote both high-efficient pure electric and hybrid vehicles simultaneously and improve shares of both types by a wide margin. To be more specific, significant energy saving and emissions reduction can be achieved by promoting electric vehicles in some subsectors (such as Passenger vehicle (PV), Light truck (LT), Bus and Motorcycle (MC)), and by promoting hybrid vehicles in other subsector (Heavy truck (HT)).

Looking for robust and sustainable solutions, the management turns to integration approaches analyzing the whole process chain. Basic elements from the functional strategy of an enterprise are selected in order to enhance the value creating processes. A structure for forming the cost-cutting strategy by means of the Lean Production is suggested. The necessity for using Value Stream Mapping as a strategy execution tool is demonstrated. Within the Value Stream Design each particular process step is reconsidered with respect to wasting in order to shorten the lead time and to enhance the flow along the process chain. Process steps which do not add value the customer's needs are modified or eliminated. A new road map of the process is drawn pointing out future activities of the enterprise to be implemented. Practical significance of the devised approach to forming and realizing the cost-cutting strategy is indicated. During realization of the cost-cutting strategy at the enterprise a set of recommendations was formulated, advising the use of equipment with flexible readjustment. This equipment was also recommended for use on various stages of the production process. For example, installation of multipurpose hotmelt lamination device and integrating folding unit for the table cover drape prior to set assembly reduced the wasting by 3.7 days within the overall process time. Implementation of the organizational innovations that we have formulated lead to the improvements in the material and information flows within the Lean Production Concept at the enterprise. Particularly, these suggestions were connected with developing measures for reducing time wasting at the packing lines, rational use of production personnel of the enterprise, organizing more ergonomic production layouts for the service staff to decrease time wasting during maintenance.","[Jac, Ivan] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Liberec, Czech Republic; [Zaytsev, Alexander Vladimirovich] Moscow State Text Univ, Analyt Lab, Moscow, Russia",Technical University Liberec; Kosygin State University of Russia,"Jác, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Liberec, Czech Republic.",ivan.jac@tul.cz; josef.sediar@hartmann.info; zayand12@yandex.ru; az-inform@mail.ru,"Jáč, Ivan/AHB-3088-2022; Zaytsev, Andrey/A-1772-2014","Jáč, Ivan/0000-0003-4759-2990;",,,,,24,4,4,0,29,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Often, they differ in terms of culture and business practices compared to the mother country of such a firm. This fact undoubtedly shows a decreasing role of psychic distance in making decisions about the choice of a market and the form of entry to foreign markets. The aim of the article is to identify the importance of psychic distance for the Polish born globals. The research hypothesis assumes that the characteristics of born global owners/managers enable them to 'omit' psychic distance, which accelerates internationalization of their firms. In the study, the case study method was applied, the subject of which was four Polish born globals from the SME sector. The analysis of the meaning of psychic distance in the process of Polish born global internationalization allows concluding that this phenomenon does not have a decisive impact on the choice of foreign markets. The aim of this study is to examine the internationalization of born-global firms based on the concept of psychic distance. The study uses the qualitative method; that is a study case that aims to identify factors that influence the psychic distance perception by born-global managers. The results of the study show that psychic distance has a small influence on the choice of foreign market. Specific characteristics of global-born managers (global orientation, work experience, command of foreign languages, formal and informal relations) are a stimulus to fast internationalization. The research has a character of a pilot study, which is necessary to conduct the study on a bigger scale. These are the first studies of this type conducted among Polish born globals.","Cracow Univ Econ, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Przybylska, K (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka St 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",przybylk@uek.krakow.pl,,"Przybylska, Krystyna/0000-0002-8970-0550",,,,,34,3,3,0,28,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

For this purpose, a market equilibrium model has been developed, covering the dynamic demand and supply interactions of logistics and transport markets. The emergence or closure of terminals is modelled assuming free market entry and exit, and competition by product differentiation. In a first step, analytical results are presented showing that investment grants for terminal operators could have a negative effect on market efficiency due to a massive entry on the market for terminals. In a second step, a hierarchical choice model mapping the decisions of shippers/forwarders in detail is combined with the market equilibrium model. The combined simulation model is applied to German terminals, and different policy packages are analysed. It can be seen that in markets with high volume, the welfare maximizing policy strategy is the internalisation of external cost only. However, in less developed markets, a combination of both, direct subsidies in form of investment grants and internalisation of external cost, could be indicated. Finally, the implications of the results derived from the model and the empirical analysis of transport policy are identified.

Therefore, we do not know whether copyright protection now provides weaker incentives to bring forth new products. This paper assesses the quality of new recorded music since Napster was established in 1999. First, I create an index of high-quality music from critics' retrospective lists. Next, I rely on music sales and airplay data, using the idea that if one vintage's music is better than another's, its superior quality should generate higher sales or greater airplay through time, after accounting for depreciation. I find no evidence of a reduction in the quality of music released since 1999, and the two usage-based indices suggest an increase since then. Researchers and policy makers thinking about the strength of copyright protection should supplement their attention to producer surplus with concern for consumer surplus.","[Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227",,,,,18,74,89,2,44,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We show that altruistic parents' financial transfers have a disincentive effect on the labor supply of their children and that the children's equilibrium income is positively correlated with parental income. Based on the theoretical model, we find that redistributing US$1 from children to their parents increases parental transfers by less than US$1, implying that intergenerational public transfers are Ricardian non-neutral. However, the non-neutral redistributive transfers may enhance intergenerational family bonds because the equilibrium levels of services rendered by children to their parents increase.","Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Chang, YM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 319 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",ymchang@ksu.edu,,,,,,,48,4,4,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This article contends that much of the guiding force of todays antitrust policy stems from these early sentiments, applied to thoroughly different legal and economic circumstances. Specifically, monopolists constrained by antitrust law are very different today from their historical counterparts, sharing a name but little else. Modern antitrust, with its focus on price-theoretic micro-models, treats all bearers of market power alikedespite markets being narrowly defined and economic and political effects differing greatly among them. Antitrust, as practiced today, infringes upon rights to property and freedom of contract and gets away with it simply by defining those constrained as monopolists. The implicit assumptions that this article challenges are that monopolists as such deserve no protection and that by mere virtue of their monopolistic status can be constrained whenever it is in societys (or consumers) interest to do so. I examine the rights monopolists might justifiably claim, as well as counter-arguments to such claims, within the framework of Rawls theory of justice and his veil of ignorance thought experiment. These allow for going beyond current biases to examine what a just society would demand of its economic actors, and when justice demands protection of those limited by todays antitrust policy.","Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Ayal, A (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel.",Adi.Ayal@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

J,"Walsh, K",,,,"Walsh, Keith",,,Understanding Taxpayer Behaviour - New Opportunities for Tax Administration,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMICS,"There is a growing literature on the contribution of behavioural economics to the design and improvement of tax policy. A less well-developed area is the potential for behavioural research to contribute to better tax administration. Better understanding of the motives of taxpayers and their attitudes and behaviour towards taxation can improve both voluntary compliance and the efficiency of the tax administration. The literature suggests tax compliance is determined by five broad factors: deterrence; norms (both personal and social); fairness and trust (in the tax administration); complexity of the tax system; and the role of government and the broader economic environment. Research in Ireland suggests that deterrence, the more traditional tool of tax administrations, is important but not sufficient to explain the level of tax compliance in society. Other factors are shown to be important, particularly the influence of personal norms and the level of trust in the tax administration. Perceptions of the prevailing social norms are also important determinants of compliance but appear to exert less influence on taxpayers than personal norms. The experiences of tax administrations in using behavioural research to influence taxpayers are examined and work in this area in Ireland is outlined.","Off Revenue Commissioners, Planning Div, Res & Analyt Branch, Dublin, Ireland",,"Walsh, K (通讯作者)，Off Revenue Commissioners, Planning Div, Res & Analyt Branch, Dublin, Ireland.",keithw@revenue.ie,,,,,,,51,38,45,0,45,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

We then discuss the interpretation and enforcement of the AML's abuse of dominance provisions, on the one hand generally in the context of China's new market competition environment and its political-legal system, and on the other hand specifically through a consideration of some recent antitrust cases on the abuse of market dominance.

The results show that market potential was central to the existence of the manufacturing belt, that it mattered more than factor endowments, and that its impact came through interactions both with scale economies and with linkage effects. Market potential was generally much higher for states in the manufacturing belt. Natural advantage played a role in industrial location decisions in the late 19th century but its importance then faded away.","[Crafts, Nicholas] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Klein, Alexander] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of Warwick; University of Kent,"Crafts, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",n.crafts@warwick.ac.uk,"Klein, Alexander/H-2941-2014; Klein, Alexander/KBQ-6003-2024",,ESRC [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021248/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,77,36,40,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Before coming to the topic of harmonization of legal rules, it first briefly deals with the question of why rules are necessary at all, and what the functions of rules are. Then it deals with the lessons from the recent financial crisis for the topic mentioned. The article conducts a kind of cost-benefit analysis of legal harmonization by looking at arguments in favor of and against uniform rules. It shows that not only the arguments in favor have increased after the recent financial crisis, but also the arguments against. It also shows that integration of global markets has not only increased the need for new uniform rules but also decreased the chances of their implementation; and that therefore today it is often better to improve the implementation of current rules instead of laying down new uniform rules.","Univ Hagen, Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Wagner, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Hagen, Germany.",helmut.wagner@fernuni-hagen.de,,,,,,,57,7,7,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Most previous studies have concentrated on ranking the bowl-eligible teams according to their perceived strengths, and using these rankings to predict the winner of a specific bowl game. In this study, using eight years of data and three popular data mining techniques (namely artificial neural networks, decision trees and support vector machines), we have developed both classification- and regression-type models in order to assess the predictive abilities of different methodologies (classification versus regression-based classification) and techniques. In the end, the results showed that the classification-type models predict the game outcomes better than regression-based classification models, and of the three classification techniques, decision trees produced the best results, with better than an 85% prediction accuracy on the 10-fold holdout sample. The sensitivity analysis on trained models revealed that the non-conference team winning percentage and average margin of victory are the two most important variables among the 28 that were used in this study.

According to this prediction, legislatures can recast supreme courts' roles in society by modifying jurisdictional rules. This study tests this prediction empirically. Using a newly assembled data set on appeals terminated by the Taiwan Supreme Court for the period 1996-2008, we study the effect of jurisdictional-source procedural reform, a switch from mandatory jurisdiction to discretionary jurisdiction in 2003, on the Taiwan Supreme Court's performance. Our study shows that the 2003 reform failed to transform the function of the Court from correcting error to a greater role in leading the development of legal doctrine as intended by the legislature. Our findings suggest that a supreme court can adjust the way it conducts business according to its own preference and the role it defines for itself, which are influenced both by the background against which it operates and the inertia of its members' working habits. Our study informs policy-makers that merely amending procedural rules, without more, is unlikely to change the function of a supreme court. Our findings also suggest that statutorily dictated mandatory jurisdiction may not be implemented by a high court faced with caseload pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A number of developing countries have recently extended this principle to create an obligation on the state to compensate the victims of environmental harm. This variation of the polluter-pays principle is aimed at ensuring victims' compensation when polluters cannot be identified or are insolvent and at providing stronger incentives for local governments' monitoring of environmentally risky activities. These regimes hold local governments primarily or jointly-and-severally liable for environmental damage and allow them to act in subrogation against the polluters. In this paper we study the effect of these forms of governmental liability on the polluters' incentives and on aggregate levels of environmental harm. We develop an economic model to study the conditions under which governmental liability may be preferable to direct polluters' liability as an instrument of environmental protection. We conclude by suggesting that these variations of the polluter-pays regime may be desirable in environments characterized by widespread poverty, high interest rates, judicial delays and uncertainty in adjudication.

An Analysis of Pharmaceutical Markets,JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRODUCT QUALITY; PATENT; INFORMATION; INNOVATION,"Standard analysis of intellectual property focuses on the balance between incentives for research and the welfare costs of restraining output through monopoly pricing. We present evidence from the pharmaceutical industry that output often fails to rise after patent expirations. Patents restrict output by allowing monopoly pricing but may also boost output and welfare by improving incentives for marketing, a form of nonprice competition. We analyze how nonprice factors such as marketing mitigate and even offset the costs of monopoly associated with intellectual property. Empirical analysis of pharmaceutical patents suggests that, in the short run, patent expirations reduce output and consumer welfare by decreasing marketing. In the long run, patent expirations benefit consumers, but by 30 percent less than would be implied by the reduction in price alone. Focusing only on the pricing issues of intellectual property may lead to incomplete or even inaccurate conclusions for welfare.","[Lakdawalla, Darius] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Philipson, Tomas] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Southern California; University of Chicago,"Lakdawalla, D (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,"Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042","NIA NIH HHS [P30 AG043073, RC4 AG039036] Funding Source: Medline",NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,30,16,17,1,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,,,J LAW ECON,J.

Two key themes are addressed: the scope of the outdoor environment to support a sense of belonging to new places, and how choices and values enacted in the public realm might reflect changing transnational identities. The fieldwork focused on one neighbourhood in Sheffield, UK, and engaged participants from five different countries of origin in self-recorded audio techniques. Analysis of narratives revealed a process of engagement with the strange and familiar in everyday places, and that emotional qualities of place attachment can be strengthened by the recognition of transnational links. The visibility of activities and interactions in outdoor places was useful both for the learning of everyday skills, and for modelling diverse cultures within the neighbourhood. We suggest that the representational qualities of place both reflect and shape transnational identities, and perceptions of these inform choices of engagement or disassociation.","[Powell, Mark; Rishbeth, Clare] Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Powell, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Crookesmoor Bldg,Conduit Rd, Sheffield S10 1FL, S Yorkshire, England.",markjamespowell@gmail.com; c.rishbeth@sheffield.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/D005353/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/D005353/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,67,12,14,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Project portfolio selection for making decisions on investment is a critical decision in many companies and organizations. This selection is a sophisticated and muticriteria problem, due to miscellaneous criteria which are often in conflicting with each other. The authors define six criteria for selecting the optimal project as cost criteria (risk, payback period) and benefit criteria (Profitability, consistent with corporate goals and objectives, flexibility, and sustainability). On the other, project portfolio selection problem is often influenced by uncertainty in practice; also because of the uncertainty associated with imprecision, loss of information and lack of understanding. In this paper, the implementation of an organized framework for project portfolio selection has discussed through the proposed model base on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and VIKOR techniques using linguistic terms in order to calculate the importance weights of evaluation criteria and rank the feasible projects in descending order respectively.

For this reason in consumer behavior it is important to analyze this dynamic and try to find the reasons for this changes, because only by this its behavior can be forecasted. This article gives an insight in the changes of the behavior of the Romanian consumer, depending on age and geneder. For different segments of population it is analyzed the social and emotional behavior, with the purpose of determining the particularities of it and the reasons which are behind it.","[Istudor, Nicolae; Pelau, Corina] Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,corinapelau@yahoo.com,"Pelau, Corina/F-4663-2015; Istudor, Nicolae/AAW-2872-2020","Pelau, Corina/0000-0002-6139-028X;",,,,,11,1,1,1,18,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0103-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,249,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN33,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317436900051,0

The survey is aimed at identifying transnational corporations that have established R&D centres in Poland, getting to know motives behind transferring R&D activity to Poland and models for their internationalization. The internationalization of R&D takes place on the largest scale in the following three OECD regions: the United States, European Union and Japan. Recently there has been a growing tendency toward locating research and development activity in developing and transforming countries (including East-Central Europe). Furthermore, Poland has been attracting greater number of investments in R&D sphere. On the basis of the survey conducted in Poland, 57 R&D centres established by transnational corporations were identified. The internationalization of R&D activity conducted by enterprises in Poland takes certain forms as far as transferring of this activity is concerned (local adopter, internal performer, local constructor and global constructor).","[Koziol-Nadolna, Katarzyna; Wisniewska, Joanna] Tech Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, PL-71307 Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Koziol-Nadolna, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Mickiewicza 69, PL-71307 Szczecin, Poland.",kkoziol@univ.szczecin.pl; gjowi@wneiz.pl,"Wiśniewska, Joanna/GLS-1259-2022","Wiśniewska, Joanna/0000-0002-1607-8721",,,,,25,0,0,0,23,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

These require that the sender is capable, i.e. has sufficient incentives for acquiring true beliefs, and reliable, i.e. has sufficient incentives for truthfully communicating her beliefs. Focusing on the incentives in knowledge transfer reveals why some knowledge is more easily shared and what factors facilitate the transfer. Similarly, the reason for why some knowledge resists to be disseminated can in many cases be attributed to the lack of incentives rather than to tacitness.","Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Leppälä, S (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",leppalasm@cardiff.ac.uk,"Leppälä, Samuli/AAZ-3762-2021","Leppala, Samuli/0000-0002-1702-0417",,,,,86,4,4,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

This offers the backdrop to this exploratory study on the internal and external sources for developing innovation capabilities in the Malaysian automotive sector. The paper is based on cases developed through interviews in the field. Overall findings indicate the sector itself is dominated by supplier firms that are mostly involved in parts that are not very high tech, like plastic or metal parts, and there is little by the way of product innovation, and most innovation relates to changes in processes (this is with the exception of the two national car manufacturing firms Proton and Perodua). The foreign players have been mostly assemblers and while they are well linked in terms of intra-firm networks with access to technological resources, this does not seem to have spilled over to the supplier firms - offering an option for policy to leverage this resource, as done in the electronics sector. While there are indications that several of these firms are passive in terms of innovation activities/capabilities and could be in danger of not being competitive if they lose their anchor customer, there is anecdotal evidence where firms (small and large) have become competitive and gone into export markets by developing external linkages, and internal resource developments thus overcome barriers to limited resources or markets size for innovation.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Semenyih, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia,"Mohan, AV (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Malaysia Campus Jalan Broga, Semenyih, Malaysia.",mohan.avvari@nottingham.edu.my,"Mohan, Avvari V./O-5001-2019","Mohan, Avvari V./0000-0002-8829-7157",,,,,12,3,4,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Despite the strong linkages between Japan, the United States and the European Union, Asia seems to be very attractive as a location for R&D activities. It is also striking how the role of Japan as a partner of other Asian countries decreased mainly in favour of the United States. We find that, while being an attractive destination of foreign firms, Asia is becoming an active global player which sources R&D and technology from other regions. At the aggregate level, there are strong differences in R&D internationalization across regions. Using cluster analysis, we find two groups of countries. The first group is oriented towards exploring and acquiring technology and the second groups towards seeking and providing technology. This might indicate that each region follows a different R&D internationalization path. Alternatively, it might also be a sign of unequal capabilities of going global.","[Nepelski, Daniel; De Prato, Giuditta] JRC Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Nepelski, D (通讯作者)，JRC Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain.",Daniel.Nepelski@ec.europa.eu,"nep, daniel/AAQ-7413-2021","Nepelski, Daniel/0000-0001-5893-4779",,,,,45,14,14,0,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Using four objectives (from general to specific) with the help of five hypotheses, out of which three have been validated through research, a basis for a more ample quantitative research is created, which would emphasize the role of ethics as leverage in gaining customer loyalty on the Romanian market of mobile telephony.","[Pop, Nicolae Al.; Roman, Mihaela] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,,nicolae_al_pop@yahoo.com; mihaella.roman@gmail.com,"Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/L-9045-2016","Pop, Nicolae Alexandru/0000-0003-4565-4879",,,,,26,0,0,0,14,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0104-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,104,+,,,,,,3,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN34,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317437100022,0

In the traditional economic theory of the oligopoly market, the number of firms is small and each firm restrains the others in an attempt to coordinate price or output and thereby increase overall profitability. In order to remain competitive and profitable in the industry, firms emphasize R&D and innovation to utilize their knowledge and advance their technology. Baumol indicates that firms compete not only in regard to prices, but also to introduce new products and new processes into the oligopoly market. This competition means that the R&D expenditure and innovation activities are the mediums of competition and have created an arms race relationship between the firms. This paper is built around this argument presented by Baumol. In order to test Baumol's hypothesis, we utilize firm-level data for three types of oligopoly markets - the international foundry market, the international cellular telephone market, and the Taiwan oil market - to provide empirical results from a first difference model, finite distributed lag model and a hypothesis test. The key findings of this paper are as follows - first, firms create an arms race with regard to R&D expenses while engaging in innovation activities; and second, evidence indicates that the arms race will accelerate under a more competitive oligopoly market in which technology improves rapidly.","[San, Gee; Cai, Wan-Chun] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Zhong Li, Taiwan",National Central University,"San, G (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Ind Econ, Zhong Li, Taiwan.",sangee827@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Stylized facts are developed from the social psychology, network analysis and economic geography literature in order to construct specific agent behaviours with respect to four types of actions: social interaction, learning, creativity and migration. The model demonstrates how location affects the evolution of social networks from a neutral initial state and in turn how these trajectories establish varying contexts in which creative activity can flourish or founder. Ultimately, the model shows why individuals tend to be more creative in large and diverse locations. The article presents four additional scenarios which test notions of: local diversity versus specialization; nature versus nurture; the role of differing local education strategies; and competing talent attraction and retention strategies.","Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Spencer, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",greg.spencer@utoronto.ca,"Spencer, Gregory M/B-8179-2012",,,,,,46,15,17,3,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In general marketing role of Facebook is considered with special attention to the advertising. Advertising on Facebook is briefly introduced with possibilities of advertising targeting and its performance monitoring metrics. The current methods of efficiency measuring of online advertisement from the area of econometric modeling (specifically data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis) are mentioned and their suitability for use by small and medium enterprises is questioned. The composite efficiency index is proposed to measure online advertising efficiency and to give base for a comparison of online advertising campaigns. It is based on simple measures like click-through rate and costs per click, to assure its simple usage and easy result comparison in conditions of small and medium enterprises. Proposed composite efficiency index is tested on sample data from the Slovak Facebook advertising market acquired by our own survey. The efficiency of Facebook advertising campaigns of Slovak companies, which supported our research and provided their data about particular advertising campaign, is measured by composite efficiency index and then compared with estimated data on other online forms of advertising in conditions of Slovak online advertising market. Results show higher Facebook advertising efficiency than efficiency of banner and contextual advertising in Slovakia. Also preferences and expectations about Facebook advertising are investigated by the survey The highly positive attitude towards advertising on Facebook of Slovak companies was detected. Possible threats to the future of Facebook advertising and Facebook itself are indicated. In discussion are included topics for further research in this area. The main conclusion is the fact that Facebook can be powerful and effective marketing tool for reaching online population.","Tech Univ Kosice, Ekon Fak, Katedra Aplikovanej Matemat & Hospodarskej Inform, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Vejacka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Ekon Fak, Katedra Aplikovanej Matemat & Hospodarskej Inform, Kosice, Slovakia.",martin.vejacka@tuke.sk,"Vejačka, Martin/P-2998-2016","Vejačka, Martin/0000-0002-9761-7597",,,,,26,16,18,0,86,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

We develop a conceptual game-theoretic framework that allows for the trusting partnership to have become equilibrium in a regulatory bargaining game with delegation. The monopoly service provider initiates a more cooperative relationship with regional authorities by offering a share in the joint venture. The latter being benevolent welfare maximiser either accepts or rejects the offer taking into account transportation market characteristics, local budget constraints, information structure, as well as socio-economic and political factors. Once the partnership is formed the private information of the parties is revealed and information rent is eliminated creating the room for welfare improvement. However, ex ante rational organisational choice to form a trusting partnership may not lead to welfare improvement ex post. In the extended model we consider how concessionary passengers and fare-dodgers affect the bargaining outcomes.

Contracts include the price to be paid by the consumer ex ante and stipulated damages to be paid by the firm ex post in the event of an accident. Although the stipulated damage payments are a potential solution to the moral hazard problem, firms have a private incentive to reduce the stipulated damages (and simultaneously lower the up front price) in order to attract the safer consumers who are less costly to serve. The competitive equilibrium-if an equilibrium exists at all-features suboptimally low stipulated damages and correspondingly suboptimal levels of product safety.

The first of these problems is how best to define the baseline option, i.e. what will happen if no new safety measures are introduced. The second problem concerns choice of a method for selection of targets for intervention that ensures maximum safety benefits. The third problem is how to develop policy options to minimise the risk of indivisibilities and irreversible choices. The fourth problem is how to account for interaction effects between road safety measures when determining their optimal use. The fifth problem is how to obtain the best mix of short-term and long-term measures in a safety programme. The sixth problem is how fixed parameters for analysis, including the monetary valuation of road safety, influence the results of analyses. It is concluded that it is at present not possible to determine the optimal use of road safety measures precisely. One may at best determine a range that is likely to contain the optimal use of a set of measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, there are several instruments that have been in place for many years, such as mandatory design standards, taxes on fuels, car purchase and ownership, and energy efficiency labels. Yet it is still not clear whether consumers value energy efficiency as a characteristic of vehicles. In this paper we use the European labelling system for light vehicles, which classifies automobiles according to their relative fuel consumption levels, as a novel, alternative indicator for energy efficiency. Moreover, we use a unique database that incorporates official commercial prices along with prices obtained through 'mystery shopping' at a selection of Spanish car retailers. We apply the hedonic price method to this database to estimate the price functions for vehicles and thereby obtain the marginal price of vehicles rated highly in terms of energy efficiency. Our results show that vehicles labelled A and B are sold at prices 3 to 5.9 percent higher than those with similar characteristics but lower energy-efficiency labels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Road construction, apart from its many benefits, has also a negative impact on the natural environment causing its deterioration or division, introduces changes in area management, or may be the cause of social conflict. The decision to choose the most beneficial road alignment variant should take into account all of these aspects. It is therefore a multicriteria issue, based on transport, economic, social and environmental criteria. This article presents the influence of the assessment method of variants, criteria and their weights, as well as preference scenarios of road alignment with the example of the section of the S61 expressway, which is a part of the first Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). Four road alignment variants were analysed using the AHP, SAW and TOPSIS methods, with different sets of criteria weights and various preference scenarios. It has been shown, that the used variant assessment method, the criteria and their weights all have a significant influence on the results of the analysis and there is need for more uniform rules in reference to the methodology of conducting multicriteria analyses in designing road alignment.

Transport policy interventions are typically focussed on addressing structural economic weaknesses. Yet despite a strong general interest in wider economic benefits, their relevance to schemes in remote rural areas has received very little previous discussion. We argue that remote rural areas are likely to exhibit market distortions in the goods and labour markets, primarily arising from a lack of alternatives and choices in these areas. We also illustrate the empirical importance of the wider economic benefits, caused by these distortions. Using case studies from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland to do so. We find that focusing the cost benefit analysis only on the primary transport market can significantly underestimate welfare benefits, and that the degree of underestimation varies significantly case by case. It is highest for schemes where the impacts on business and employment are large and where all of the output and employment effects occur in a remote rural area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an intra-day dataset for five major international stock market indices, we find that the the multifractal model for realized volatility improves upon forecasts of its earlier counterparts based on daily returns and of many other volatility models. While the more traditional RV-ARFIMA model comes out as the most successful model (in terms of the number of cases in which it has the best forecasts for all combinations of forecast horizons and evaluation criteria), the new model performs often significantly better during the turbulent times of the recent financial crisis.

The general setting of this article is to suppose that transport operators face a constraint on minimum travel time and to examine, in a comparative static framework, what is occurring when this minimum travel time is altered. The analysis takes into account three aspects of freight travel time savings that deserve specific attention and have been, to our knowledge, neglected in existing approaches: the distinction between make to order and make to stock production contexts, the distinction between travel time and transportation time and finally the impact of transport time savings on wider logistics organisation. In this context, the present contribution analyses how this change in the minimum travel time affects the different economic agents' tradeoffs between the duration and cost of the various operations used in production and transport activities. Our findings show that the benefits of travel time savings are at least equal to the sum of travel operating costs reduction, decrease of generalised immobilisation costs of the good (depreciation, financial immobilisation costs, and costs of damage insofar as are related to transport duration). We also draw the implications of this analysis for the valuation of projects that save travel time for freight. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The question is to what extent port infrastructure investment in China also contributes to growth of the regional economies involved, through mainly direct and indirect relations. We estimate the output elasticity of port infrastructure through production function, applying panel data analysis for the period of 1999-2010, and calculate the model at the level of four port regions as well as the port province level. The results indicate clear positive effects of port infrastructure investment in all regions, however, the strength varies considerably among the four regions, with the Yangtze River Delta region (Shanghai) at the strongest level, followed by the Bohai Rim region (Tianjin), the Southeast region (Guangzhou) and the Central region, where the influence is the weakest. The analysis indicates that differences are related to the character of the port (land or sea), stage of economic development of the region, international network connectivity, and the spillover effects from adjacent regions. Overall, the weakest relation tends to be with landside transport infrastructure density. The paper closes with some policy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Beside car-sharing and -pooling, six services targeted at improving and encouraging the use of urban public transportation were considered. On the empirical basis of 42 in-depth interviews with representatives of previously identified mobility types (N=1991) and standardised mobility diaries quantifiable reduction potentials achievable through a shift to lower-emission transportation modes were revealed. The average reduction potential for greenhouse gas emissions per person and year was found to be 78 kg in an optimistic scenario and 25 kg in a pessimistic scenario. Extrapolated to the German metropolitan population, behaviour-related measures alone could result in a 1.8 million ton (optimistic scenario) or 0.6 million ton (pessimistic scenario) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. In order to exploit this potential fully, however, target group specific information should be obtained and communication strategies developed, as addressed in this paper.

The paper explores longer distance commuter cyclists, their characteristics, practice and motives. Longer distance, commuter cyclists ( > 5 km from home to work) have more mobility options, higher incomes, and a longer education than other commuter cyclists. The main motive for longer distance cycling is physical exercise, followed by reduced costs and time used for traveling. The long distance commuter cyclists surveyed are very positive about their commute - pointing to positive experiences, better mood, and stress relief as experiences related to their cycle trip to work. Policy support should devote attention to unlocking the potential that may be embedded in individuals combining their exercise and travel time, budgets to promote active travel to work as well as the role of psychological benefits as a factor in promoting and sustaining cycling practices.

This study examined changes in college students' debt and possession of credit cards, as well as attitudes toward debt and credit cards over that time at one American college campus. Results indicate that the number of credit cards held and the amount of credit card debt both decreased in the time following the 2009 Credit CARD Act. Attitudes toward debt gradually became more negative over the past 10years, whereas perceived personal financial well-being increased. Although debt is decreasing, some students continue to report high levels of debt and correlates of higher levels of debt continue to include year in school, decreased ability to delay gratification, and lower levels of perceived financial well-being. Overall, it appears that students' relationship with credit cards is changing, but many still have difficulty managing credit.","SUNY Coll Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Buffalo State College,"Norvilitis, JM (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",norviljm@buffalostate.edu,"Norvilitis, Jill/DZX-2478-2022","Norvilitis, Jill/0000-0002-5848-391X",,,,,33,18,28,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

CBA is used in this paper to advise the Norwegian government on the impact of limiting the height of heavy vehicles to 4.0 m, as suggested in European Union's Directive 96/53/EC. Currently, Norway does not limit the height of vehicles. We use the vehicle height measurements taken from the Norwegian road network and calculate the costs and benefits that would result if the directive were implemented. The results reveal, in maximum, that (i) limiting vehicle height to 4.0 m would increase the distance travelled by Norwegian heavy vehicles by approximately 1.66%; (ii) annual road haulage costs would increase by approximately 1.2 billion NOK; (iii) the annual costs of CO2 emissions would increase by approximately 20 million NOK, and the annual costs of NOx emissions would increase by 14 million NOK; and (iv) the annual cost of road accidents would increase by 10 million NOK. The results show that the regulation, if implemented, would cause Norway to experience socioeconomic loss of approximately 24.6 billion NOK over 25 years in maximum. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis with respect to expected increase in vehicle kilometers travelled indicates that the conclusions derived are robust. This paper thus advises the government not to implement the regulation. The government has listened to the advice provided in this paper and decided not to support the proposal limiting vehicle height because it would cause adverse effects for haulers and for the economy in general. Hence, we urge the continued use of CBA to aid decision making in the transport sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this framework should be expanded. A first step is to explore the complex interdependencies of long-term lifestyle decisions, medium-term decisions about residential location and car ownership, and the underlying residential and travel attitudes. Travel behaviour should be considered within a hierarchy of decisions while considering the motivational background of these decisions. Using data from an Internet survey completed by +1800 respondents in Flanders, Belgium, this paper defines car ownership somewhat more broadly as car availability. Results of a structural equation model indicate a significant direct effect of the residential neighbourhood on car availability. However, effects are small compared to the influence of other variables such as stage of life and travel (mode) attitude, the latter referring to travel-related selfselection. Moreover, one should keep in mind that residential attitudes remain important in the initial selection of the residential neighbourhood and its spatial characteristics, indicating the need to control for residential self-selection.

There are two main federal programs that provide funding for such incentives for small U.S. airports: the Essential Air Service (EAS) program and the Small Community Air Service Development Grant (SCASDG) program. While the EAS program has received considerable academic attention, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the success of SCASDG recipients in attracting and retaining their targeted air service. Using a metric of SCASD grant success, this paper evaluates the outcomes of 115 SCASD grantees from 2006 to 2011. In each year, fewer than half of the grant recipients were ultimately successful in meeting the goals of their proposal. Several case studies suggest that successful grantees often had significant community or airline support prior to submitting their grant and were located in slightly larger-than-average communities. Further careful consideration is necessary to determine whether reform of the SCASDG program is warranted to more effectively support the development of small community air service in the United States.

The focal price collusion theory suggests that such asymmetric pass-through could be a result of collusive behavior because collusion is easier to sustain when costs are falling than when costs are rising. Using a lag-adjustment model as the econometric framework, findings from this study show strong evidence for asymmetric adjustments of the US inbound freight rates in response to fuel cost changes. Such asymmetry persisted after the passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. Moreover, the findings do not support the consumer search theory as an alternative explanation for the freight rate asymmetry.","Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Fung, MK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",afmikef@polyu.edu.hk,,"Fung, Michael King-Fai/0000-0003-1469-320X; Fung, Mike/0000-0003-4254-8907",,,,,39,5,5,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

This paper develops and empirically investigates a novel hypothesis, which is that constitutions are also shaped by transnational influence, or diffusion. Constitutional rights can diffuse through four mechanisms: coercion, competition, learning and acculturation. To analyze diffusion in the constitutional realm, we traced the historical documents of all post-WWII constitutions and documented the presence of 108 constitutional rights. With this data, we first demonstrate and analyze the rapid global spread of constitutional rights over the past six decades. We then estimate a spatial lag model to explain their adoption. Our results show that the decision of countries to adopt a right is correlated with past adoption by their former colonizer, countries with the same legal origin, the same religion, the same former colonizer, and the same aid donor. These transnational correlations are strongest when a nation adopts its first constitution.

The reason is that the proper valuation of energy efficiency requires time and effort, but differences in efficiency across products will rarely be pivotal to choice when consumers have strong preferences regarding other product attributes. The paper first explains why proper valuation of efficiency is difficult, even in the presence of government energy labels. It next develops a model that shows how to value additional information about energy efficiency in a discrete-choice context. It then uses data on automobiles to show that consumers experience only small welfare losses when forced to choose a car without detailed information about fuel costs. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of rational inattention for both economic research and public policy.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Sallee, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,53,116,139,0,22,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We first discuss the microstructure to show that over-dispersion is inherent in the modeling of market structure based on sales count data. The model is built on the likelihood function induced by decomposing sales count response variables according to products' competitiveness and conditioning on their sum of variables, and it augments them to higher levels by using the Poisson-multinomial relationship in a hierarchical way, represented as a tree structure for the market definition. State space priors are applied to the structured likelihood to develop dynamic generalized linear models for discrete outcomes. For the over-dispersion problem, gamma compound Poisson variables for product sales counts and Dirichlet compound multinomial variables for their shares are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Instead of the density function of compound distributions, we propose a data augmentation approach for more efficient posterior computations in terms of the generated augmented variables, particularly for generating forecasts and predictive density. We present the empirical application using weekly product sales time series in a store to compare the proposed models accommodating over-dispersion with alternative no over-dispersed models by several model selection criteria, including in-sample fit, out-of-sample forecasting errors and information criterion. The empirical results show that the proposed modeling works well for the over-dispersed models based on compound Poisson variables and they provide improved results compared with models with no consideration of over-dispersion.

Data on plant size come from Italian censuses. Civic capital turns out to have a positive effect on both the average and standard deviation of size. Looking at several precise points of the plant size distribution, we find that it shifts toward the right and becomes more dispersed where civic capital is high. Furthermore, we explore to what extent the effect is heterogeneous across plants in relation to some specific characteristics. The potential endogeneity of current civic capital is addressed by instrumenting it with historical variables. We conclude that the geographic variation in the stock of civic capital poses substantial constraints on plants' ability to expand.

We show that empirical support for this secular trend is feeble and depends on the data sources used, especially GDP estimates. The U also vanishes under dynamic panel estimations. Moreover, cross-country differences in levels of FLFP related to historical contingencies are more important than the muted U patterns found in some specifications. Given the large error margins in international GDP estimates and the sensitivity of the U relationship, we propose a more direct approach to explore the effect of structural change on FLFP using sector-specific growth rates. The results suggest that structural change affects FLFP consistent with a U pattern, but the effects are small. We conclude that the feminization U hypothesis as an overarching secular trend driving FLFP in the development process has little empirical support.","[Gaddis, Isis] World Bank, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Klasen, Stephan] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] Ifo Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany; [Gaddis, Isis; Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Gaddis, Isis; Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",The World Bank; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",igaddis@worldbank.org; sklasen@gwdg.de,,"Gaddis, Isis/0000-0002-4450-0723",,,,,106,132,144,2,69,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The development of viable alternatives could provide benefits in terms of energy diversity thus reducing dependence on any given nation for our energy needs. This manuscript examines the drivers for alternative fuels in the light of the needs of aviation and it provides criteria wherein potential alternative jet fuels can be compared. A wide range of transportation fuels was qualitatively examined using these criteria. Because of concerns regarding their safe use and the energy efficiency loss that would be inherent in their use, alcohols and biodiesel are better suited for ground transportation. Cryogenic fuels are not feasible in the near term because of the large existing aircraft and airport infrastructure that is incompatible with these fuels. Synthetic fuels offer aviation with a wide range of potential feedstocks that could augment or potentially replace petroleum, but concerns regarding the economic cost of production and the current lack of feedstock availability limits their near term availability to aviation.

The financial series are fitted into a family of asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH) models. As the skewness and kurtosis are common characteristics of the financial series, a skew-t distributed innovation is assumed to model the fat tail and asymmetry. Prior research indicates that the QML estimator for the APARCH model is inefficient when the data distribution shows departure from normality, so the current paper utilizes the semi-parametric-based SVM method and shows that it is more efficient than the QML under the skewed Student's-t distributed error. As the SVM is a kernel-based technique, we further investigate its performance by applying separately a Gaussian kernel and a wavelet kernel. The results suggest that the SVM-based method generally performs better than QML for both in-sample and out-of-sample data. The outcomes also highlight the fact that the wavelet kernel outperforms the Gaussian kernel with lower forecasting error, better generation capability and more computation efficiency.

Several open-source communities related to Linux ports to embedded processors have been studied, obtaining a set of indicators by modelling them as a social network. Exploratory factor analysis has been used to extract the main dimensions related to the participation process. Participation inequality, hierarchy and the cohesion of the community constitute the main dimensions characterizing the participation mechanism within communities.

This article considers this tension in a historical context. Limits were sometimes placed on the number of votes that controlling shareholders could cast in corporate elections. These limits protected minority shareholders by giving them relatively more voting than cash-flow rights. The evidence shows that voting limits led to less shareholder concentration and less leverage.

We use a hand-collected data set of nearly all excessive fee complaints filed between 2000 and 2009 to investigate several topics, including the relationship between fee levels and the odds that funds would be targeted by excessive fee suits, the relationship between fee levels and suit outcomes, the relationship between excessive fee suits and subsequent fee changes, and the relationship between excessive fee suits and subsequent asset flows. Our most basic finding is that although fees had some ability to predict which funds would be targeted, the strongest predictor of targeting was family size: funds in larger families were much more likely to be targeted than funds in smaller families.

This paper builds a theoretical foundation for the dynamics of knowledge sharing in private industry. We model an uncertain research process and ask how the incentives to license intermediate steps to rivals change over time as the research project approaches maturity. Such a dynamic approach allows us to analyze the interaction between how close the firms are to product market competition and how intense that competition is. We uncover a basic dynamic of sharing such that firms are less likely to share as they approach the product market. This dynamic is driven by a trade-off between three effects: the rivalry effect, the duplication effect and the speed effect. We show that this dynamic can be reversed when duopoly profits are sufficiently low or when the firms have asymmetric research capabilities.

The results show that antitrust enforcement may lead to a reduction in food price volatility and, in some cases, may even cause long periods of price rigidity in the concerned markets. We consider that observed hysteresis in prices may be due to the disruption of the mechanism played by associations in the transmission of information about how to pass on the cost shocks to their customers or, importantly, to the change in pricing behavior by keeping prices above competitive levels, but stable enough to minimize the risk of another antitrust intervention. This strategic conduct would be in line with the findings in the theoretical literature about collusion in the presence of competition authorities.","[Manuel Ordonez-de-Haro, Jose; Luis Torres, Jose] Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Manuel Ordonez-de-Haro, Jose] Univ Malaga, Catedra Polit Competencia, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga,"Ordóñez-de-Haro, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",jmoh@uma.es; jtorres@uma.es,"Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021; ORDÓÑEZ-DE-HARO, JOSE MANUEL/GWU-8843-2022","Torres, Jose L./0000-0002-7469-5656",,,,,45,4,4,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

J,"Miles, TJ",,,,"Miles, Thomas J.",,,Does the Community Prosecution Strategy Reduce Crime? A Test of Chicago's Experience,AMERICAN LAW AND ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BROKEN WINDOWS,"A new strategy of criminal prosecution, called community prosecution, emerged in the past two decades. The strategy breaks with the traditional approach to prosecution in which a prosecutor works in an office adjacent to a criminal court, processes a large volume of cases, and measures success with conviction rates and sentence lengths. In community prosecution, a prosecutor works directly in a neighborhood, develops relationships with local groups, aligns enforcement priorities with residents' public safety concerns, and seeks solutions to prevent crime. This article presents the first estimates of community prosecution's impact on crime. Over a fifteen-year period, Chicago's top prosecutor twice applied the community prosecution strategy in some (but not all) neighborhoods, and this sequence of two off/on policy episodes permits plausible identification of the strategy's impact. Differences-in-differences estimates show that community prosecution reduced certain categories of crime, such as aggravated assault, but had no effect on other categories, such as larceny. The diversity of practices under the rubric of community prosecution makes generalization difficult, but the estimates from Chicago show that the strategy has the potential to produce cost-justified reductions in crime.","[Miles, Thomas J.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Miles, Thomas J.] Univ Chicago, Crime Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Miles, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tmiles@law.uchicago.edu,,,,,,,47,1,1,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

However, limited by data gaps and the weaknesses of the prevailing research method, few studies have quantified driving restrictions' effects on traffic and researchers disagree about the air quality effects of driving restrictions. We take advantage of the Chinese cultural resentment toward the number four and use the unequal stringency of alternative restricted plate numbers as repeated exogenous treatments to identify the marginal effects of driving restrictions. For the first time in similar studies, we introduce data measuring traffic condition to help explain the mechanism of driving restrictions' traffic and air quality effects. We find that more stringent driving restrictions had a positive impact on city-wide traffic speed, but little effect on the concentration of inhalable particulates. Given Beijing's extremely congested roads, we consider it most plausible that due to the non-monotonic network-level traffic speed volume relationship, a marginal reduction in the number of usable vehicles may result in fewer delays, but little or even negative impact on air quality. This implies that positive traffic and environmental effects of a policy may not go hand in hand. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper follows the work by Egert and Kierzenkowski (2014) as we test the hypothesis that the real estate boom had an adverse impact on country's export performance. For that purpose we use quarterly data ranging from 1Q1998 to 3Q2013, and estimate export equations using maximum likelihood and dynamic ordinary least squares estimators of cointegration. Our results indicate that the distortion of relative prices in favor of non-tradable sectors (construction and real estate), which is a direct by-product of the real estate boom, has had stifling effects on export performance. Our results also suggest that ailing cost competitiveness and governments' inability to implement policies promoting private sector economic development adversely influenced export performance during the period analyzed. The basic conclusion of our research is that the expansion of a non-tradable sector in a country with limited supply of production factors can have a detrimental effect on the ability of the tradable sector to increase its output and compete in international markets.","[Tkalec, Marina; Vizek, Maruska] Inst Econ, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Tkalec, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Trg JF Kennedyja 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mtkalec@eizg.hr; mvizek@eizg.hr,,,,,,,22,6,6,0,9,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

While the CBA framework may be accurately matched to the practical process of specific policy implementation for some governing organizations, and provide valid evidence for application under other frameworks, it does not account for the role of policy windows and policy entrepreneurs in policy decision making, or for the role of effective advocacy. After a review of the, existing literature, I suggest the multiple streams framework as a more suitable framework for understanding decision making with regard to non-motorized transportation policies, and provides a useful structure for future research (particularly on the role of advocacy groups and policy entrepreneurs in the planning and policy process).

In a 2-period president-Senate-Court game, we show that some new justices vote disingenuously and so move the perceived ideology of the overall Court closer to their ideally preferred outcome, which influences the selection of future justices. Justices will sometimes have an incentive to exaggerate the extremeness of their preferences and at other times will seek to appear more moderate. Systematic changes in judicial behavior can be predicted on the basis of the characteristics of the cases; the initial ideologies of the justices, the president, and the Senate; and the probabilities of retirement of the justices. These results have important implications for interpreting judicial voting behavior: particularly, it is not safe to infer changes in actual judicial preferences from changes in expression of judicial preferences.","[Bustos, Alvaro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Jacobi, Tonja] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Northwestern University,"Bustos, A (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",,,"Jacobi, Tonja/0000-0002-5200-5765",,,,,20,8,8,0,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

To do so, we analyzed the strategic reaction of importers and supermarkets who import Spanish fresh produce into France. We considered the implementation and enforcement of the European General Food Law as an exogenous shock for French food operators. In France, depending on the situation, food operators can transfer their liability to someone else in the food supply and imports decisions are crucial indicators. After 2005, supermarkets transferred the liability risk linked to importing sensitive products to importers. We argue that this regulatory change also prompted French importers of fresh produce to develop a horizontal, collective governance structure to monitor the safety of imported produce.","[Rouviere, E.] AgroParisTech, UMR G EAU, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Latouche, K.] INRA, LERECO UR1134, F-44026 Nantes, France",AgroParisTech; INRAE,"Rouvière, E (通讯作者)，AgroParisTech, UMR G EAU, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",elodie.rouviere@agroparistech.fr; karine.latouche@nantes.inra.fr,,"ROUVIERE, Elodie/0000-0003-2540-8558",,,,,28,13,16,0,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Based on earnings management, this paper reveals inherent mechanism of how the noise in executive compensation incentives comes into being and plays a role by empirical research.","[Chen Yipu; Zhang Kaiyuan] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Chen, YP (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",13120667@bjtu.edu.cn; 13120667@bjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,ST PLUM-BLOSSOM PRESS PTY LTD,HAWTHORN EAST,"STE 4, LEVEL 3, 695 BURKE RD, HAWTHORN EAST, VC 3123, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9924140-8-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,522,527,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2MF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358894900086,0

After presenting the network-based rationales of growth and structuring of clusters, we analyze under which structural conditions a regional cluster can achieve short-run competitiveness without compromising long-run resilience capabilities. We show that the properties of degree distribution (the level of hierarchy) and degree correlation (the level of structural homophily) of regional knowledge networks should be studied to understand how clusters succeed in combining technological lock-in with regional lock-out. We propose simple statistical measures of cluster structuring to highlight these properties and discuss the results in a policy-oriented analysis. We conclude showing that policies for regional resilience should focus on ex-ante regional diagnosis and targeted interventions on particular missing links, rather than ex-postmyopic applications of policies based on an unconditional increase of network relational density.","[Crespo, Joan] Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Suire, Raphael] Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Vicente, Jerome] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, LEREPS, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Vicente, J (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, LEREPS, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",vicente@univ-tlse1.fr,"Vicente, Jerome/H-5784-2011; Suire, Raphael/S-6292-2016","Vicente, Jerome/0000-0002-0274-1799; Suire, Raphael/0000-0003-1735-9709; crespo, joan/0000-0002-3059-5776; Crespo, Joan/0000-0003-4053-8158; Vicente, Jerome/0000-0003-2556-2061",,,,,76,175,196,33,200,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Importantly, studying Egypt is motivated by the introduction of a floated exchange rate regime in January 2003. This regime shift rendered the exchange rate an active monetary transmission mechanism channel. Methodologically, to quantify the volatility, the study applies two types of models, the univariate ARCH-type model and the Stochastic Volatility model. As for the misalignment measure, the paper will follow Edwards' model (1989).

It aims at developing a more differentiated view on the spatialities of learning by focussing on knowledge practices in which neither physical nor relational proximity are available. More specifically, the article explores on the basis of a 'netnographic approach' interactive knowledge collaboration in nine 'hybrid virtual communities' that reflect a broad spectrum of organizational set-ups from firm hosted over firm related to independent communities. Our empirical analysis reveals that hybrid virtual communities even in the absence of physical or relational proximity are able to produce economically useful knowledge; that despite the low importance of proximity the physical and material conditions play a crucial role for knowledge collaboration in hybrid virtual communities; and that hybrid virtual communities afford unique technical opportunities and social dynamics that foster learning processes unattainable in face-to-face contexts.","[Grabher, Gernot] HafenCity Univ Hamburg, Sch Urban Planning, D-22085 Hamburg, Germany; [Ibert, Oliver] Leibniz Inst Reg Dev & Struct Planning, D-15537 Erkner, Germany; [Ibert, Oliver] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geog Sci, D-12249 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Grabher, G (通讯作者)，HafenCity Univ Hamburg, Sch Urban Planning, Winterhuder Weg 31, D-22085 Hamburg, Germany.",grnot.grabher@hcu-hamburg.de,"Grabher, Gernot/C-4875-2013",,,,,,100,122,132,2,101,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

A safety-first decision criterion is used for ensuring a minimum level of habitats, and this is formulated in a chance-constrained programming framework. The theoretical results show; (i) inclusion of quality growth reduces overall cost for achieving a future biodiversity target from relatively early establishment of habitats, but (ii) consideration of uncertainty in growth increases total cost and delays establishment, and (iii) cost-effective trading of habitat requires exchange rate between sites that varies over time. An empirical application to the red listed umbrella species - white-backed woodpecker - shows that the total cost of achieving habitat targets specified in the Swedish recovery plan is doubled if the target is to be achieved with high reliability, and that equilibrating price on a habitat trading market differs considerably between different quality growth combinations.

As a means to achieve this, the paper undertakes an empirical analysis of data stemming from the World Competitiveness Index of Regions, and identifies regional competitiveness as a dual concept that explains relative differences in rates of economic development across regions, as well as an understanding of the future economic growth trajectories of regions at a similar stage of economic development.

However, since landowners are not obligated to take everyman's rights into consideration when making management decisions, the recreational quality of nature areas is not guaranteed for users. We examined whether individual recreationists on private lands would be willing purchase management actions from landowners that influence recreational quality. In addition to willingness to pay, we assessed willingness to contribute labor to such actions. The results demonstrated that about half of the recreationists who participated in our survey were willing to contribute labor and about 10% were willing to pay to direct the management of their typical recreation site on private lands. The mean willingness to pay was 92 euros per year and the mean willingness to contribute labor 3.5 days per year. A latent class regression model revealed that recreationists were not, however, completely homogeneous in their preferences for the actions or in their preferred contribution forms. On the basis of the results, there is moderate demand from recreationists for management to improve recreational quality and the potential for local landscape management arrangements that allow individual recreationists to contribute labor.

Coercive taxation and opposition of taxpayers to paying taxes generate their fiscal behaviour as a form of expression designed to hinder the fulfillment or application of tax laws or impose conditions in achieving its objective. The main form of taxpayers resistance to increased taxes is represented by tax evasion, whose magnitude is directly proportional to the size of the tax burden. It is well known that adjusting the fiscal pressure may cause changes in behaviour of individuals to work, savings, investment and compliance with taxes. Contrary to the widespread ideas in economic literature, the efficiency of the tax system should not be understood as the amount of funds collected to the public budget, but the measure it influences the behaviour of individuals in the direction of supporting the development of society. Therefore a tax system will be more effective if it is able to determine the highest possible level of the social created product, level that might be achieved only under conditions of optimal stimulation of individuals / groups' behaviour.","Ctr Financial & Monetary Res Victor Slavescu, Bucharest, Romania",,"Mihaila, N (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial & Monetary Res Victor Slavescu, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,160,165,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100022,0

The results reveal that call and put implied volatility of S&P CNX Nifty index option does contain information about future realized return volatility. This study accounts for the problem of error-in-variable and controls for it by using the instrumental variable technique. In the 2SLS estimation, the Hausman H-statistic shows that call implied volatility is measured with error. Hence, 2SLS coefficients are more consistent than the OLS estimates.

Results show that unit costs depend significantly on cost features like estimation methodology, inclusion or exclusion of cost components, carbon accounting method, area size, alternative land uses and beneficiaries, time horizon, and the continent in which the forest protection scheme is implemented, but also factors like the share of agriculture in a nation's economy play a significant role in explaining unit costs.

Our research contributes to the current knowledge of asymmetric exchange relationships through demonstrating the importance of a franchisee's expectations confirmation, relational trust and relationship satisfaction in franchisee assessments of network conflict. The goal of this paper is to empirically examine (1) the relationship between franchisee perceptions of information quality (information dissemination and information search) and the confirmation of franchisee performance expectations, (2) franchisee characterizations of their relationships with their franchisors in terms of relational sentiments such as trust and relational satisfaction, communication and conflict management, (3) the relationship between franchisee satisfaction and perceived conflict, and (4) the moderating effect of franchisee experience on the relationship between franchisee satisfaction and franchisee perceptions of conflict. Empirical results, utilizing a sample of 345 franchisees in Australia, present strong evidence for the support of nine of the ten hypotheses drawn from the conceptual model. Specifically, data reveal that in an effort to cultivate a network of cooperative and satisfied franchisees, franchisors should adopt strategies that promote the timely dissemination of relevant and meaningful pre- and post-entry information, open communication exchange, transparent conflict management systems and personalized support in accommodating individual franchisee needs.","[Weaven, Scott K.; Grace, Debra A.; Frazer, Lorelle; Giddings, Jeffery] Griffith Univ, Dept Mkt, Griffith Business Sch, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Weaven, SK (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Mkt, Griffith Business Sch, Gold Coast Campus, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",s.weaven@griffith.edu.au; d.grace@griffith.edu.au; l.frazer@griffith.edu.au; j.giddings@griffith.edu.au,"weaven, scott K/C-9937-2016","Frazer, Lorelle/0000-0001-9297-1987; Weaven, Scott/0000-0001-9150-7111",,,,,80,11,14,0,45,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Although IJVs have been a very commonly used entry form many studies have indicated that the IJVs have not reached the goals set for them or they have clearly failed. Recently there has been also a growing interest to examine the performance and determinants of successful IJVs in China from major developed countries. The studies have so far mainly focused on IJVs where the foreign partners are either from Asian countries or from big western economies like from the USA whereas research focused on IJVs established by firms from small developed European economies like from various Nordic countries has been extremely limited. This paper tries to shed some light on this gap by analyzing the performance and key success factors of Finnish-Chinese IJVs from a Finnish parent perspective. In the paper a conceptual model to examine key IJV performance determinants is first built up and then we apply this model in the analysis of a few Finnish-Chinese IJVs. The results of the study show that IJV performance depends on the measure of the performance. Focusing on management evaluation of performance the FDI experience and timing of entry are found to be the key success factors at IJV formation stage while partner commitment is the key success factor at IJV operation stage. At the end of the paper, conclusions are made and limitations are discussed together with an outline of future research directions.","[Zheng, Xiaosong] Shanghai Univ, Sydney Inst Language & Commerce, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaosong] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business Adm, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Larimo, Jorma] Univ Vaasa, Fac Business Studies, Vaasa, Finland",Shanghai University; Tallinn University of Technology; University of Vaasa,"Zheng, XS (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sydney Inst Language & Commerce, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China.",xiaosong.zheng@shu.edu.cn; jorma.larimo@uwasa.fi,"Zheng, Xiaosong/AAN-7934-2021",,,,,,70,3,4,0,30,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The dynamic analysis of strategic groups in the Korean electronic parts SMEs shows that four to five different strategic patterns (subcontractor, production-focus, market-focus, innovator, and market-diversified groups) with significant performance differences emerged depending on the period. For instance, the innovator group outperformed the subcontractor group in terms of return on sales. The production-focus group (which exhibited a relatively higher performance level in the early 1990s) gradually deteriorated in profitability in the late 1990s. Subsequently, a substantial number of SMEs (25% of sample firms on average) have attempted to shift their strategic configurations with different performance consequences. These results imply that given the rapid technological development in the industry and changes in the global production network with the emergence of Chinese competitors, Korean SMEs should focus on technological innovations to maintain their competitive position by relentlessly enhancing their technological development capabilities rather than production capabilities.","[Kim, Youngbae] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Ha, Seongwook] Hansung Univ, Dept Management, Seoul 136792, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Hansung University,"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Management, 85 Hoegi Ro, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",ybkim@kgsm.kaist.ac.kr,"Kim, Youngbae/C-1985-2011","Ha, Seongwook/0000-0002-2269-7182",,,,,20,4,4,1,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Specifically, we contribute to the empirical literature on freight agents' mode choice by exploring the role of the perceived importance of the most relevant service dimensions in determining the attractiveness of two alternatives to all-road transport: logistics terminals and road-sea intermodal services. This is carried out through a revealed/stated preference experiment and a mixture of logit framework. Our results support the hypothesis that operators' attitudes towards time, punctuality and risk of loss/damage can significantly enhance the explanatory power of the choice model, thus providing useful information for policy-makers to improve the regional freight mobility system. The all road option is preferred by hauliers concerned with the risk of loss/damage but it is, instead, disregarded by those assigning great relevance to punctuality. We also found substantial heterogeneity among respondents: larger firms tend to assign a lower value to time but a higher importance to the risk of loss/damage, especially if shipments are not frequent. In addition, the relevance of service reliability is higher the reliability greater the load size. Finally, we find that the nature of the transported goods significantly influences the choices of operators: when consigning perishables, hauliers tend to prefer the flexibility of a road-related mode. Any policy aiming at fostering the growth of intermodal transport and logistics and to remove obstacles to implementing rationalisation policies in the field of freight transport should take account of these elements.

We propose that these findings may be driven by the particularities of the industrial settings chosen in these studies. We argue that in project-based industries, negative localization externalities associated with competition grow proportionally with cluster size, while positive localization externalities increase more than proportionally with cluster size. By studying the survival patterns of 4607 firms and 1229 subsidiaries in the global video game industry, we find that the net effect of clustering becomes positive after a cluster reaches a critical size. We further unravel the subtleties of the video game industry by differentiating between exits by failure and exit by acquisition and conclude that being acquired is best considered as a sign of success rather than as a business failure.","[De Vaan, Mathijs] Columbia Univ, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Frenken, Koen] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Columbia University; Utrecht University; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl,"Frenken, Koen/C-4486-2017","Frenken, Koen/0000-0003-4731-0201; de Vaan, Mathijs/0000-0003-1971-7290",,,,,83,55,58,3,133,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In the recent literature at the interface between economics, psychology and neuroscience, several authors argue that economists could develop more predictive and explanatory models by incorporating insights concerning individuals' hedonic experiences. Some go as far as to contend that utility is literally computed by specific neural areas and urge economists to complement or substitute their notion of utility with some neuropsychological construct. In this paper, I distinguish three notions of utility that are frequently mentioned in debates about decision theory and examine some critical issues regarding their definition and measurability.

This paper uses a theoretical model to examine the differences in owners' incentives to invest in talent when they are operating as monopolists, as duopolists, or as a cross-owned team. Our model shows that economic competition results in an ambiguous level of investment compared to that of a monopolist. A firm that engages in cross-ownership will invest less in talent compared to a duopolist, but the difference in profits is ambiguous.

Since Japan was the second largest market in the world, they targeted the Japanese market to enter. Even if the firms were small, they had clear global strategies about where to invest. These companies had competitiveness to conduct business in Japan, in particular to satisfy the high level of quality. The problems they face in Japan are related to traditional Japanese business practices such as long-term relationships among Japanese industrial groups.

We argue that these results rely heavily on assumptions of a small economy and perfect capital mobility, which tie down the amount of capital. In this paper, we proceed by analyzing the case of an economy in which the availability of capital is endogenously determined by domestic savings. We find that the new capital accumulation effect is opposite to the previous dependency rate effect, leaving the effect on economic growth ambiguous. In particular, if the former prevailed, population aging would foster economic growth, a result that finds support in recent empirical work.","[Aisa, Rosa; Pueyo, Fernando] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Pueyo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",fpueyo@unizar.es,"Rived, Rosa María Aisa/H-2182-2015; Pueyo, Fernando/L-7161-2014","Rived, Rosa María Aisa/0000-0003-4368-2294; Pueyo, Fernando/0000-0002-9410-3531",,,,,21,11,14,2,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In contrast to other existing approaches, the methodology used in this paper has the advantage of modeling all data within a single unified framework which allows one to disentangle the model-based news from each data release and subsequently to assess its impact on the forecast revision. The results show that the inclusion of high frequency data on energy and raw material prices in our data set contributes considerably to the gradual improvement of the model performance.

In this paper we empirically test the precautionary saving theory and explore different measures of macroeconomic uncertainty, using Spanish regional data for the period 1980-2007. Our results suggest that part of the recent increase in saving rates is related to a precautionary motive and that increased uncertainty causes greater savings rates.

But the agency relationship must be genuine. To discern genuine agency agreements, the prevailing approach adopted in both the United States and the European Union focuses on whether the agent has incurred any specific risk or cost in relation to the distribution of the manufacturers goods. Yet this approach has tended to obscure the economic nature of agency relationships. The real question to ask is not whether the agent has incurred any specific cost or risk, but instead whether, in a given case, an agency model, rather than a distribution model, actually constitutes a more efficient form for organizing distribution functions between the contracting parties. In fact, over a quarter of a century ago, Judge Richard Posner proposed a business justification approach for analyzing agency agreements in Morrison v. Murray Biscuit. Building on Morrison, and on the economic literature of property rights and agency problems, this article explores the fundamental question of how parties choose to enter into an optimal contractual form, and, moreover, proposes an economic approach to discern genuine agency agreements. It also calls for revision of the current EU Vertical Guidelines on agency agreements, which are so stringent that they deter businesses unnecessarily from entering into agency arrangements.","Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Zhang, AH (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London, England.",angela.angelazhang@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,3,3,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The genuine producer profit is shaped by two opposite effects: (1) a positive aspirational effect resulting from a sales increase due to the aspirational consumers who seek to imitate the lifestyle of snob consumers (2) a negative snob effect, resulting from a sales decrease due to the reduction of consumption by some snob consumers. We identify the conditions under which the overall effect generated by counterfeiting can increase the genuine firm profit.

We also explore possible consequences of monopolization of the search engine market for advertisers and users in the form of excessive pricing and deterioration of the quality of the search results. Second, in the technical analysis part, we incorporate these considerations in a two-sided market model and analyze the rate of innovation, pricing, and quality choices by the dominant search engine. Our findings show that a dominant monopoly platform results in higher prices and underinvestment in quality-improving innovations by a search engine relative to the social optimum.

But this theorem is inapplicable in its current form, since one of its premises - voter independence - is notoriously violated. This premise carries responsibility for the theorem's misleading conclusion that 'large crowds are infallible'. We prove a more useful jury theorem: under defensible premises, 'large crowds are fallible but better than small groups'. This theorem rehabilitates the importance of deliberation and education, which appear inessential in the classical jury framework.

We are now well placed to design a simplified performance-linked payment (SPLP) model that can be used as a reference point to ensure value for money, given the accumulation of experiences throughout the world which have revealed substantive common elements in contracts. Whether the payment to the operator is framed as a payment per passenger or as a payment per service kilometre, the SPLP identifies efficient subsidy outcomes that are linked to a proxy indicator of net social benefit per dollar of subsidy. We illustrate how the SPLP model can be applied to obtain the gross (subsidy) cost per passenger (or per passenger km) from measures of gross cost efficiency and network effectiveness. This model can then be used as part of a benchmarking activity to identify reference value of money prospects in respect of passengers per $ subsidy outlay by adjusting for influences not under the control of the service provider. A single framework to identify contract payments to operators, and to assess (i.e., benchmark) operator performance on critical KPIs, is provided by internalising critical key performance indicators (KPIs) in the design of the SPLP. The proposed SPLP model is sufficiently general to be independent of the procurement method (competitive tendered or negotiated, for example) and of the treatment of revenue allocation (net or gross based contracts), with the additional advantage of being able to assess value for money for government.

Kahn, 1917-2010",REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Biographical-Item,,,,,,Alfred Kahn; Airlines; Antitrust; Public utilities; Regulation; Telecommunications,,"Our introduction to this compendium reviews Alfred Kahn's academic and policy interests, his activities as a regulator and advisor to governments and companies, and the interactions between these aspects of his life as an economist. Although best known for his research on the economics of regulation and his application of microeconomic principles in his role as a regulator and advisor, Kahn's academic research portfolio was much more diverse. He wrote about patent policy, economic development, antitrust policy, and other topics, in addition to his work on regulation and deregulation. Even before becoming a regulator he was actively involved in applying economic principles to regulatory problems as an advisor and consultant. In all of his work Kahn recognized that markets were imperfect, but that policies aimed at improving market performance often made things worse. His experience as a regulator and consultant strengthened his recognition that the costs of imperfect regulation had to be carefully balanced against the costs of imperfect markets. One had to search for the best that could be done in an imperfect world. Kahn was particularly fascinated by the challenges of designing and implementing policies to govern the transition from regulated monopoly or oligopoly to an industry that would ultimately rely primarily on competitive markets to govern firm behavior and performance.

While the specification of service quality standards is a common practice, the relationships between the specifications and customer satisfaction are often methodologically unclear. Based on a South African case study, the paper uses data collected from a group of passengers who have personal cars but choose to use public transport, and a control group of passengers who only use their cars, in the same corridor as the user group, to estimate a service quality conjoint model. The model is used to evaluate the effect of different public transport service packages, defined in terms of different combinations of service attributes, on passenger satisfaction. The paper confirms the need to classify service attributes in terms of their relative impact on passenger satisfaction, at the service design stages, where performance in respect of some attributes has a disproportionate impact on satisfaction, especially where public transport is competing directly with private transport. Practical applications and limitations of the methodology are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Such KPIs (the workshop identified cost efficiency, service quality and safety/security as the top three) can be explicitly included in the contracts (with a focus on compliance) or can be rather informal and part of a trusting partnership. Limited availability of good data and appropriate information technology systems appear to be the greatest challenges within developed markets. In the context of creating a formal market (such as the South African taxi market), which encourages public transport measurement and compliance, our findings suggest that it is important to set as a first step minimum standards to address the backlog with respect to establishing performance measurement regimes.

The government is faced with huge public pressure to improve public transport systems in the face of rising fuel costs, the pending implementation of expensive urban toll road systems in the Gauteng province, and elsewhere in urban environments, public transport safety issues, public transport fleet renewal, especially the commuter rail services, as well as limited resources to fund public transport. As a developing country, the South African Government has pressing funding issues such as funds needed to improve housing for the poor to improve schooling and public health services. Government is also faced with a vocal minibus taxi industry that transports an estimated 65% of all commuters in the country that is also insisting on subsidies for its services. Many policies and strategies have been put in place to address the public transport system in the country, some more successful than others.

Lundbeck, the courts rejected a challenge to a consummated acquisition that had placed under common control the only two drugs for treating a serious heart condition in newborns. Clinical studies showed that the two drugs were equally effective, and the only alternative, surgery, was not a good substitute. Moreover, prices shot up immediately after the acquisition. Yet the courts ruled that the FTC failed to demonstrate substitutability in response to a price difference between the drugs. This article explains why the much-criticized result and rationale of the case plausibly were correct. Analysis of a bespoke model of competition between therapeutic substitute drugs reveals that: (1) competition plausibly results in monopoly pricing, and if not, (2) competition plausibly results in near-monopoly pricing.","US Dept Justice, Antitrust Div, Washington, DC 20530 USA",,"Werden, GJ (通讯作者)，US Dept Justice, Antitrust Div, Washington, DC 20530 USA.",gregory.werden@usdoj.gov,,,,,,,3,1,1,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Despite the growth of multimodal transport (by land, water and air), shipping still continues to be the major mode of transport in the bulk carriage of country's overseas trade. In view of this vital role of shipping, in the first four decades of independence, under the initiative of planned development and active government support, India's shipping and port sector saw dramatic growth in their performance to build adequate national fleet, in keeping up with the transport of overseas cargo. However, the onset of economic liberalization in 1991 has given rise to many new dimensions in the development of the shipping and port sector of the country with a significant redefinition of shipping and port services, in response to the new global trend patterns. For instance, it has also established the new era of containerization in the mode of cargo delivery from the dominance of the era of bulk and break-bulk trade during the decade of sixties and seventies. Moreover, as global competition increases, in response to this emerging trade patterns within this country, India's volume of traffic growth also increases manifold. So, India's shipping and port sectors need, significantly, to build up and furnish their capacity by increasing the frequency of this mode of transport. i.e. the growth of the national overseas fleet to meet this surging demand. This paper, therefore, have focused on this role of shipping in such rising overseas trade, with a view to examine the shipping performance (the growth of overseas fleet) in response to the growing overseas trade at all ports of India during the period (1999-2000 to 2008 2009), in terms of both a mathematical model and a graphical representation. Finally, it concludes that the absolute overseas trade, being highly import dependent, have led to a more or less stagnant performance in overseas shipping, owing to the lack of the adequate growth of absolute overseas exports during this period.

Unless our regional space is reorganized to upgrade development of towns and cities and integrate them with each other and the larger cities, the urbanization process in India will become unsustainable. It is argued that High Speed Rail (HSR) can play a role in achieving this more balanced and sustainable development of towns and cities, opening up opportunities for growth across a wider, interconnected, region, with the benefit of taking the pressure of the larger cities to absorb additional burgeoning populations. This paper will make the case that in the current Indian context, current patterns of mega-city growth are unsustainable, and that HSR can play an important role in providing opportunities for medium and smaller size cities through their interconnections. It begins by highlighting the role that railways have played in India and other countries, noting that merely economic analysis of their costs and benefits generally underestimated their contributions to development. It then provides an introduction to HSR and its potential impact in general, before applying this to the example of the State of Karnataka in South India. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To generate this harmonised response, road safety management agencies are being urged to adopt multisectoral collaboration (WHO, 2009b), which is achievable through the principle of policy integration. Yet policy integration, in its current hierarchical format, is marred by a lack of universality of its interpretation, a failure to anticipate the complexities of coordinated effort, dearth of information about its design and the absence of a normative perspective to share responsibility. This paper addresses this ill-conception of policy integration by reconceptualising it through a qualitative examination of 16 road safety stakeholders' written submissions, lodged with the Australian Transport Council in 2011. The resulting, new principle of policy integration, Participatory Deliberative Integration, provides a conceptual framework for the alignment of effort across stakeholders in transport, health, traffic law enforcement, relevant trades and the community. With the adoption of Participatory Deliberative Integration, road safety management agencies should secure the commitment of key stakeholders in the development and implementation of, amongst other policy measures, National Road Safety Strategies and Mix Mode Integrated Timetabling.

Expenditures of state and regional budgets should be reduced to improve their final bilance. Individual sectors of the economy should review each expenditure item to make sure that funds will be spent effectively as does the Ministry of Industry and Trade in the Czech Republic. The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of industrial zones support as a tool of the regional development policy under current economic conditions in the Czech Republic. This support as an important part of investment incentives was provided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic over the period of 2006-2009. The main source for the analysis is the data set obtained in empirical research carried out by the authors of this paper, accomplished economic analysis of economic performance of observed firms and also available statistical data.

The South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences (SAJEMS) is considered to be one of the leading publications in the field of economic and managerial research in South Africa. The SAJEMS was selected as the unit of analysis; and a content analysis was conducted on 257 articles published during the seven-year period 2004 - 2010. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the input and output factors relating to published articles, including questions on authors and article content, such as the various methodological approaches. The findings revealed that there has been a decrease in co-authored articles during the period 2005 - 2008. Although the contribution by practitioners increased significantly in 2005 and 2008, the majority of the articles are still authored predominantly by academics. It is promising to see that international authors were involved in nearly 20 per cent of the articles contributed. When it came to the methodological approaches, the articles employed largely non-probability sampling designs. Furthermore, almost two-thirds of the articles published in SAJEMS were based on quantitative research designs. This content analysis reveals the current research practices published in the SAJEMS.

The analysis is carried out using the global forest sector model EFI-GTM expanded to cover electricity and heat production from wood, coal, natural gas, wind and solar energy. Analysis shows that with low coal and gas prices, use of wood for energy will be limited to low cost logging residues. With high coal, and especially natural gas prices, industrial wood also comes to be used for energy. At a carbon price of 100 (sic)/tCO(2), some 32 Mm(3) of industrial wood, in addition to 224 Mm(3) of logging residues, are projected to be used for electricity and heat in the EU region (including Norway and Switzerland) in 2030. The relatively low quantity of industrial wood used by the energy sector despite the collapse of the use of coal is explained by the fact that under high CO2 prices, other energy forms like natural gas, solar and wind energy become more and more competitive. However, the amount of industrial wood used for energy may substantially increase with subsidies for using wood for electricity and heat, even with relatively low carbon prices. With a high coal and gas price and a carbon price of 100 (sic)/t, a subsidy of 30 (sic)/MWh to the wood based and coal with wood co-firing electricity production will have a significant impact on the European wood based sector. Depending on the development of the market demand for forest industry products, such a subsidy may cause a 10-12.5% reduction in forest products production, a 6-9% increase in harvest level, about 30-60% increase in the pulpwood prices, and a 6-9 fold increase of wood imports in the EU, compared to the respective case without a subsidy in 2030.

Having analysed the municipality public infrastructure and construction projects, it was concluded that their adopted project planning is incomplete, and its significance is not always understood on the municipality level. To justify the necessity for the project, it is best to start by describing the issue in question or the problem topicality. Municipalities are forced in their work to solve problem situations involving various target groups.

In the theoretical chapters, both urban (city) shrinkage and urban governance are conceptualized and an operationalization of these concepts is outlined. Urban shrinkage is understood as population losses and related phenomena such as housing vacancies, underused social infrastructures or different kind of brown fields etc. The research design for empirical study draws on mixed methodology quantitative (analysis of statistical data) and qualitative research approaches and techniques such as interviews, stakeholder workshops and participatory observations. Research questions are defined and considered to be the starting point for elaboration of empirical case studies. First, brief description of causes of urban shrinkage of the city of Ostrava in the period 1990-2011 is' presented. The main part of this paper focuses on the economic governance structures, actors and policies tackling the main cause of shrinkage, which are deindustrialization and job related out-migration, suburbanization and changes of demographic behaviour such as drop in birth rates. Ostrava is a slightly shrinking city (approximatelly 7 % population loss from 331.000 1990 to 306.000 in 2010), which managed thanks to appropriate economic governance in period 2004-2008 to slow down the population losses caused by job related out-migration. However, population losses will continue due to low birth rates and deaths surpluses or suburbanization.","[Rumpel, Petr; Slach, Ondrej] Univ Ostrava, Prirodovedecka Fak, Katedra Socialni Geog & Reg Niho Rozvoje, Ctr Mestskeho Reg Niho Managementu, CZ-70103 Ostrava, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,"Rumpel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Prirodovedecka Fak, Katedra Socialni Geog & Reg Niho Rozvoje, Ctr Mestskeho Reg Niho Managementu, CZ-70103 Ostrava, Czech Republic.",petr.rumpel@osu.cz; ondrej.slach@osu.cz; jaroslav.koutsky@ujep.cz,"Koutsky, Jaroslav/S-8495-2017; Rumpel, Petr/D-6968-2014","Rumpel, Petr/0000-0003-1583-4983; Slach, Ondrej/0000-0001-5121-041X; Koutsky, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2581-8058",,,,,51,27,27,1,45,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Creative industries are associated with their positive role in creating innovations and jobs as well as with their benefits for urban regeneration. The main aim of the text is to contribute for solving major existing problem with relatively weak empirical evidence of the topic of creative industries in the Czech Republic. Creative industries are defined using basic theoretical-methodological foundations followed by a brief outline of position of creative industries in the perspective of national economies of European countries. The core empirical analysis presented in the text draws on a unique data set compiled from the annual survey among the Czech-based firms in productive sectors in 2009 by the Czech Statistical Office. These data cover employment and financial indicators such as production, value added and wages disaggregated to particular industries according to NACE 2-digit classification. The first part of analyses findings using simple descriptive statistics and the second one uses multiple regression analysis to enhance the explanatory value of this text. There are also some basic conclusions for policy making implication for regional support of creative industries within the paper. The stress is put on necessity for spatial specification of policy making strategies. There is absolutely different position and role of the creative industries in metropolitan regions (and mainly in Prague) and in small regions or peripheral regions. Briefly, support and development of creative industries is not likely to be the remedy for all the regions in the Czech Republic.","[Slach, Ondrej; Zenka, Jan] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Koutsky, Jaroslav] JE Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Novotny, Josef] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Charles University Prague,"Slach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ondrej.slach@osu.cz; jaroslav.koutsky@ujep.cz; pepino@natur.cuni.cz; jan.zenka@osu.cz,"Ženka, Jan/AAJ-5648-2021; Novotny, Josef/B-2691-2013; Koutsky, Jaroslav/S-8495-2017","Novotny, Josef/0000-0001-9556-7162; Koutsky, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2581-8058; Slach, Ondrej/0000-0001-5121-041X",,,,,46,24,24,1,21,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

So far, both, governments of developed countries and international financial institutions, as it is presented in their own evaluations, have obtained significant results in this regard. The aim of this paper is to analyse both, theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of foreign aid in terms of human development indicators in the last years taking as a sample 45 African countries. Unfortunately, as this paper shows, many of the West's efforts to help the rest of the world and especially Africa, have done so much ill and so little good in order to improve the quality of life.

This study seeks to follow a more encompassing political-ecological approach. After a theoretical account we present the results of a case study on open space preservation in The Hague Region in the Netherlands using data from the PLUREL project (peri-urban land use relationships) carried out within the European Commission's Sixth Framework. Findings indicate that the existence of green open space can be understood by the interplay between biophysical, social and policy processes on the one hand and the politicisation thereof on the other. The analysis also suggests that green open space preservation may cause social conflict when climate change, urbanisation, counter-urbanisation and demographic change put new claims on these spaces.","[Padt, Frans J.

Languages economics and Law and Economics disciplines both emerged in the 1960s. However, no study has, hitherto, linked these disciplines. This paper intends to fill that void. Language barriers are the last major remaining barriers for the EU's 'single' market. The lack of coordination of multilingualism in the EU stems from a taboo crystallized by a dilemma between economic efficiency and linguistic diversity-i.e., the maximization of wealth versus the maximization of utility. The EU Member States (MSs) do not hasten to coordinate their language policies at the EU level inasmuch as they overestimate the benefits of the current EU multilingualism while drastically underestimating its costs. Coordination shall occur when MSs evaluate the costs and benefits of the current EU multilingualism. This will uncover the aforementioned dilemma, that will only be resolved when both Law and Economics are applied. In pursuing this objective a Linguistic Coase Theorem adapted from the work of Parisi and the Nobel Prize winner, Ronald Coase is elaborated. Having outlined the basic notions deriving from the EU Law of Languages and the Economics of Languages (Introduction), the paper scrutinizes the costs and benefits incurred by the current non-coordinated EU multilingualism (Part I). Subsequently, a 'Linguistic Coase Theorem' is elaborated in order to reach a Pareto-optimal outcome, thereby solving the dilemma-both economic efficiency and the linguistic diversity being enhanced (Part II).","Univ Paris 02, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Portuese, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 02, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",aurelien.portuese@u-paris2.fr,,,,,,,213,5,5,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

J,"Aldred, R",,,,"Aldred, Rachel",,,Governing transport from welfare state to hollow state: The case of cycling in the UK,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cycling; Environment; Health; Individualisation; Privatisation; Welfare,,"This paper analyses UK cycling policy in relation to the shift towards a hollowed-out neoliberal state. In the UK, cycling became embedded in public policy only after policy-making had been variously outsourced to private, quasi-private, and voluntary organisations. The paper argues that this broader context has contributed to the ongoing failure to treat cycling as a strategically important mode meriting substantial national transport funding. Secondly, the paper makes links between a growing policy focus on 'active' and 'responsible' citizenship, and the dispersal of cycling policy away from transport into other areas including public health and the environment. It is argued that while there are benefits to this construct, it has again helped to maintain cycling as perceived as being peripheral to the main business of 'transport'.

Guidelines began replacing court awarded support payments in the late 1970s and early 1980s. and were eventually mandated by the federal government in 1988. Two fundamentally different types of guidelines are used: percentage of obligor income, and income shares models. This paper explores the incentives to divorce under the two schemes, and uses the NLSY data set to test the key predictions. We find that percentage of obligor income models are destabilizing for some families with high incomes. This may explain why several states have converted from obligor to income share models, and it provides a subtle lesson for the no-fault divorce debate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The directive also calls for a consideration of the economic costs and benefits of improvements to the water bodies ecological status in catchment management plans, along with the introduction of full social cost pricing for water use.

Using data for the post-Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) period and focusing on developing countries, I correct for any endogeneity biases that may bedevil estimation. Employing a more inclusive index of patent protection than hitherto, which better accounts for the enforcement and implementation environment, I find that stronger protection is associated with increased royalty and license fee payments, which implies greater technology transfer to developing countries. The significance of the protection variable is driven by the subindex of patent coverage, which makes eminent sense in view of the increase in the coverage of patentable matter by developing countries after TRIPS. The economic significance of the protection variable is also substantial, with ceteris paribus changes in this variable accounting for technology inflows of U.S.$2.5-$3.2 billion (base year 2000) in the post-TRIPS sample period.","Delhi Sch Econ, Delhi, India",Delhi School of Economics,"Kanwar, S (通讯作者)，Delhi Sch Econ, Delhi, India.",,,,,,,,39,11,13,0,32,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The latter is relatively more supported by the young because its beneficial effect on longevity takes more time to occur but then lasts longer; while the old relatively prefer health spending. With population aging, political claims for health care expenditure are self-reinforcing. This framework is able to generate a quite rich set of results. In the political economy larger health care/consumption and health care/environmental quality ratios are implemented. Changes in risk aversion, production pollution, health inputs' elasticity of substitution may have opposite impacts across regimes. More complete annuity markets improve welfare.

Housing values are inextricably bound to geography-both natural amenities and human amenities matter, but in somewhat different ways. The influence of natural amenities is growing more powerful, but human amenities offer important opportunities to address market conditions because they can more readily be enhanced via public policy.

This is putting increased demands on freight transport services. Transport services should contribute to adding value, and the value added by transport can be significant if the operations take place in a well organised, efficient and market responsive transport system. This study aims to develop an original modelling approach for estimating supply chain value, and empirically focuses on a major world trade facilitator - container shipping. The paper presents the multivariate ordered probit/ logit models and the empirical results. Based on comprehensive literature review and conceptual theory building, a normative model for managing container shipping supply chains with the aim for better synchronisation and ultimately for value (i.e. profit for commercial setting) maximisation is proposed. A survey instrument is used to empirically verify the model with the data given by professionals from the world's top thirty container shipping lines. It is found that the level of supply chain integration is positively related to the supply chain value and profit. Overall, customer service activities are the most influential factor in affecting the supply chain value. Hence, we suggest firms to devote more resources and efforts in: 1) promoting supply chain collaboration; 2) upgrading customer service activities at strategic, tactical and operational levels. Other implications and recommendations are generated according to the empirical results.","[Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Infrastruct Syst & Maritime Studies, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Meersman, Hilde; van de Voorde, Eddy] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",Nanyang Technological University; University of Antwerp,"Lam, JSL (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Infrastruct Syst & Maritime Studies, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Block N1,50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",sllam@ntu.edu.sg; hilde.meersman@ua.ac.be; eddy.vandevoorde@ua.ac.be,"Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee/A-3757-2011","Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee/0000-0001-7920-2665",,,,,59,7,7,1,42,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Flexible route bus transport poses an opportunity to overcome these barriers. Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate whether the replacement of a fixed route bus service with a flexible route bus service improves the use of, and satisfaction with, buses. The study emphasises the impact on older people. Methodology: One fixed route service in Hervey Bay, Queensland, Australia, was replaced with a flexible route service. Use of the bus service was monitored via ticket sale data over a nine month period. Pension concession ticket sales were used to estimate use by older people. Satisfaction surveys were conducted before and eight months following the introduction of the flexible route service. Results: Use by older people approximately doubled over an eight month period following introduction of the flexible service. In addition, there was a significant (p=0.002) increase in overall satisfaction with the bus service following the introduction of the flexible route service. Similar improvements were found for younger people. Conclusion: Flexible route bus transport is a promising technology to help meet the transport needs of older people. Further research should investigate the cost-benefit ratio of flexible route bus services, and trial flexible route buses in other geographical and socio-cultural contexts. Flexible route bus services are not only age-friendly, but people-friendly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that incumbents do price-respond to actual but not to potential entry. The lack of preemption is due to financial distress, which precluded costly deterrence against a deep-pocketed newcomer.

The continent's abundant biodiversity underpins the fast-growing (eco)tourism industry, while its rich energy resources have seen renewed attention from global powers. Obviously, these boom-and-bust cycles of interest in African natural resources have signified the continent's place in the capitalist world order for a long time. Yet, and despite the intense ambiguities and manifold negative consequences of this history, the conservation of Africa's biodiversity riches and the exploitation of its energy resources continue to be promoted in win-win terms: beneficial to the continent and outsiders consuming the resources. The paper reviews this boom-and bust cycle of interest in Africa's resources in the light of the recent Great Financial Crisis. It argues that an initial review of mainstream responses to the crisis shows a global reflex that falls back on and so reinstates Africa's natural place in the global order.","[Buscher, Bram] Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Buscher, Bram] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Johannesburg,"Büscher, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",buscher@iss.nl,,,,,,,40,18,18,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We further contend that regulators with better information about regulated firms-that is, with lower information asymmetries-have lower decision costs, thereby facilitating regulator policy making. To empirically test our predictions, we examine the relationship between regulatory informational environments and changes to regulated rates for all investor-owned electric utilities from 1980 to 2000. We exploit several natural sources of variation in the informational environments of US state utility regulators. These stem from the prior experiences and administrative resources of regulators, observable policy decisions of other regulatory agencies for a given utility, and differences in procedural regulations pertaining to rate increases and decreases. Our results suggest that as regulators acquire more information about utility operations, including from experience in office, they are more likely to enact rate decreases and less likely to implement rate increases.","[Fremeth, Adam R.; Holburn, Guy L.

In a study on knowledge networks in the Dutch aviation industry, we test this so-called proximity paradox empirically. We found evidence that the proximity paradox holds to a considerable degree. Our study clearly showed that cognitive, social, organizational and geographical proximity were crucial for explaining the knowledge network of the Dutch aviation industry. However, we found strong evidence that too much cognitive proximity lowered firms' innovative performance, and organizational proximity did not have an effect.","[Broekel, Tom; Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Fac Geosci, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Boschma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Urban & Reg Res Ctr Utrecht URU, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",r.boschma@geo.uu.nl,"Broekel, Tom/K-7048-2014","Broekel, Tom/0000-0003-4516-4626",,,,,69,329,379,12,139,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Previous research has demonstrated that second homes are important domiciles after retirement. Nevertheless, few studies have addressed this issue specifically. Many households claim that they would use their second homes more often, and some even state that they would convert these homes into their new permanent homes. While this is a known phenomenon, its geographical outcome is rather unknown. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the conversion of second homes into primary residences. This is done with respect to timing and geographical patterns. A geo-referenced longitudinal population database allows for identifying converted properties and linking them to information of their owners' households. This facilitates a discussion regarding the impact of conversions on planning and service provision in host communities, too.

In this paper, we present some time series evidence on this issue using South African data, by applying the structural bivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) methodology proposed by King and Watson (1997). Our empirical results provide considerable support of the view that, in the long run real stock prices are invariant to permanent changes in the rate of inflation. The impulse responses reveal a positive real stock price response to a permanent inflation shock in the long run, indicating that any deviations in short run real stock prices will be corrected towards the long run value.

In the case of mixed logit models the distribution of WTP for an attribute is derived from the distribution of the ratio of individual coefficients. Since the cost coefficient enters the denominator, its distribution plays a major role in the distribution of WTP. A standard practice in analysing the data from choice experiments is to assume the cost coefficient is fixed, which implies that there is no heterogeneity in price sensitivity. The three most commonly given reasons for this are: (i) the distribution of the marginal willingness-to-pay for an attribute is then simply the distribution of that attribute's coefficient; (ii) in this way analysts wish to restrict the price variable to be non-positive for all individuals: and (iii) analysts avoid assuming log-normal cost because it is often found to produce behaviourally implausible estimates. Constraining a price coefficient to be fixed can however have serious consequences, i.e. a constant price coefficient implies that the standard deviations of unobserved utility is the same for all observations which can lead to biased results. Respondents are also likely to vary in price sensitivities, thus ignoring this variation can lead to erroneous interpretation and conclusions.

Usually this is captured through the type of area in which a firm's head office (HO) of the firm is located. But the location of the firm's other units could also have an impact on innovation. This article proposes to construct different spatial profiles of firms, based on the location of their HOs and other units in three distinct types of areas, defined according to their degree of agglomeration. The influence of these firms' spatial profiles on their propensity to innovate and innovation intensity is estimated, controlling for other determinants related to structural characteristics, the firms' relations with outsiders and with their competitive environment. This study uses a sample representative of the French manufacturing firms for the year 2006.

Small and medium size entrepreneurs represent a very important group of business subjects in the world economy which fights a number of issues. Most of these problematic factors can be eliminated or lowered by a suitably chosen tool of support of business activities. The author focuses on a specific tool of support, which includes an array of business support resources and services at once, the phenomenon of the business incubator. This form of support of business carries a complex set of services which are available to companies at an early stage of development, from their starting activities. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the effect of the business incubator as a tool of business support for small and medium size enterprises. A theoretical research is dedicated to identification of key processes and goals and is followed by a practical research which looks into detailed identification of key processes in concrete subjects of business incubation in the form of surveys given to crucial representatives of business incubation, to the managements of chosen business incubators and to their clients. The outcomes of the thesis are suitably completed by interviews with selected experts in the field of business incubation. Apart from quantitative data, also qualitative data are brought into the thesis by chosen methods. In conclusion of the thesis, the results are discussed in the context with criteria of relevance, efficiency and sustainability immediately related to procedural issues of researched subject.

External factors such as high prices for jet fuel, intense competition and elevated costs for security, given the threat of terrorist attacks, have caused airlines to restructure their organisations, use synergies within alliances and cut costs. Trends in customer needs and behaviours, demographic developments and the general competitive market environment force airlines to constantly revise their strategic directions and critically review their existing business setup. This is not only a challenge for (long) established carriers with organizational capabilities to navigate change and innovation, moreover, it is a key success factor for the future profitability of small-and medium sized market players. Airlines, possessing a relatively high growth rate will therefore have to especially reflect on their key competencies, strategic aims and will have to critically answer the question of how they want to differentiate themselves from competing market players. For those growing businesses, it is therefore essential to navigate growth in order to overcome pitfalls when innovating and preparing for their successful future. Corporate Entrepreneurship (CE) promotes innovation performance in small-and medium sized companies and therefor seems to be a viable tool for airlines to navigate novelty and innovation. This paper aims at investigating the concept of CE, initiated by economic growth for navigating commercial innovation in the small-and medium sized airline industry.","[Trestl, Michael] Univ Appl Sci Kufstein, Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management, Edelweiss Air AG,Operat Ctr, CH-8058 Zurich Airport, Switzerland",,,michael.trestl@edelweissair.ch,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,726,737,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100066,0

We show that despite this mode of genesis, industry development has stalled at an early stage and its evolution shows bifurcation: amongst the firms there are growers but also - and substantially more - stagnators. We offer a framework for understanding regional branching in late-industrialization context and for understanding differential performance/evolution. Applying this framework to our research context we find that regional branching, stalling, and the occurrence of stagnators and only a few growers can be understood from factors and hampering/conducive circumstances at the levels of the industry, the region and individual firms.",,,,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

However, this calculation is only an approximation when the population under study is finite. This paper examines the effect of error term correlations in such welfare analyses with finite samples, recognizing that individual preferences and unobserved attributes influencing choice are unlikely to change much, if at all, across scenarios or across alternatives. Such measures appear reasonably robust to deviations in assumptions of correlation. Nevertheless, we identify cases when the synthetic population samples need to be quite large for the average logsum to be realized. Another finding in these results is the substantial variation that emerges across synthetic populations, suggesting that policies that appear welfare-improving (when evaluated with average welfare formulations) may well be welfare-reducing (or vice versa) for a wide variety of actual, finite populations.

In the introduction the development of the service sector is characterized in the context of the transformation process of the Czech national economy. The further part of the article is focused on various concepts of the service industry classification, namely from the viewpoint of purpose, branch specification, impact on a customer, and the process approach. The significance of the position of individual service branches within the Czech regions was analyzed with the assistance of location quotients in two variants. Initially location quotients were determined on the basis of the number of employees in particular service branches according to the CZ-NACE classification. A similar analysis was performed in the second research phase, but it was based on the number of economic entities registered in these branches. An advantage of the second analysis is data availability on the level of two-digit CZ-NACE classification codes. Subsequently, the service branches were clustered into four basic categories: professional services, service shop, and mass services of hedonic or utilitarian characters. The executed analyses show a dominant position of the capital Prague in the service sector. Simultaneously, Prague evinces the strongest position in the category of professional services. A similar character was also found in the case of the Southmoravian region. The position of services in other regions is less important. The service sector in these regions employs in average only about 50 per cent of labour force; and it consists mainly of standardized services provided through service shops. The final part of the article presents an analysis of the effect of the services' structure on the regional economic level (measured through the gross domestic product per capita). The results do not show a significant correlation between the share of economic entities in the services and the regional economic level.","Tech Univ Liberci, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Podnikove Ekonomiky, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Zizka, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberci, Ekonomicka Fak, Katedra Podnikove Ekonomiky, Liberec, Czech Republic.",miroslav.zizka@tul.cz,"Zizka, Miroslav/I-5624-2016","Zizka, Miroslav/0000-0002-7804-3954",,,,,22,11,11,0,13,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Therefore, there is a need to analyse incentive schemes for bus drivers since the level of service of the bus system is dependent on their behaviour. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the current conditions for bus drivers in Santiago, Chile, find the main drives that influence their behaviour and compare labour conditions between different operators. We focus our study on the case of Transantiago using interviews with 100 drivers working for several bus operators. The results of our survey show that drivers in our sample prefer incentives linked to their operational performance rather than consumer satisfaction; drivers also mention that users of buses treat them poorly and are an important source of working stress; and drivers' working conditions differ dramatically between operators. Preliminary actions are proposed regarding drivers' salary in order to improve operator performance and several measures are proposed to authorities so as to even out conditions between operators, enhance passenger driver relationship and ensure that shifts and rest times are honoured.

Thus, the objective is to estimate wage rate and expenditure rate models together with a model that includes cost-weighted income. For this purpose we use discrete choice econometric models in which heterogeneity among individuals is introduced. Taking into account that the most important benefit of a transport infrastructure project is the value of the travel time saved, the subjective value of time (SVT), the results allow us to determine which microeconomic model and empirical specification are the most robust. In addition, we can obtain comparisons of the values obtained for different countries and areas of study.

Agricultural practices today are a result of abdicating control over our lives to a thoroughly industrialized culture, in which institutions are governed by the single criterion of efficiency--finding least-cost solutions. Standardization is a major part of that process. But living systems cannot be standardized. They require diversity and some degree of redundancy to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the cultural contest between the machine and the garden, the machine has definitely won, but if we do not make room for the garden again, our victory will be our own funeral. New Agrarianism seeks to encourage diversity of species on each farm and across farms within entire landscapes. But farmers cannot carry out the restoration of ecologically-oriented agriculture on their own. They need support from cities: 1) in the form of markets to sell locally-grown produce at prices that will support their work, 2) in a new understanding of ecosystems that focuses on inhabited spaces and not just wilderness, and 3) in an orientation that questions whether efficiency should be the paramount value of our culture. Finally, the transition to more biologically-diverse human settlements can come about only if economic incentives are modified to remove the unrelenting pressure on farmers to expand their operations or go out of business.",,,,,,,,,,,156,1,1,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This special issue celebrates these markers by bringing together a collection of critical engagements with Polanyi's work which, whilst sympathetic to his intellectual aims, ward against any straightforward application to contemporary issues. In so doing, it suggests that part of the value of Polanyi's work lies not in its ability to be recited, repeated and re-applied in its original form, but rather in its openness and its susceptibility to alteration and transmutation. In this introductory article, I consider the return to intellectual 'voices from the past' in the post-2008 landscape. I suggest that the distinctiveness of Polanyi's voice comes from his attempt to problematize, challenge and re-imagine the very notion of 'economy' itself, a theme which underpins all of his most important ideas, and one which reverberates across contributions to this special issue. I suggest that, beyond his immediate critique of free-market ideas, the desire to de-centre the notion of an autonomous economic sphere - and to challenge abstract modes of thought that address such a notion, regardless of their political sensibilities - is his most valuable legacy, and one which might encourage us to seek out new innovations and engagements in future Polanyian scholarship.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Holmes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",c.holmes@warwick.ac.uk,,"Holmes, Christopher/0000-0002-1248-0983",,,,,38,11,13,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

A firm is regarded as a nexus of contractual relations with owners, employees, suppliers of goods and services and customers. These contractual parties are in differing degrees tied to the firm through asset specificities. Succession can affect the value of such assets. In this sense they become stakeholders with vested interests in the succession process. The theoretical discussion of affected stakeholders is backed up by a survey study of 143 Swedish family-owned businesses that have been subject to succession. The results show that the opinions of close shareholders such as family members and incumbent mangers as well as those of other stakeholders such as suppliers and customers are important.","[Bjuggren, Per-Olof] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ratio Inst, Ctr Family Enterprise & Ownership, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sund, Lars-Goran] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ctr Family Enterprise & Ownership, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Jonkoping University,"Bjuggren, PO (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Ratio Inst, Ctr Family Enterprise & Ownership, POB 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",p-o.bjuggren@ratio.se,,,,,,,20,7,10,2,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Under the news approach, it is assumed that the forecasts reveal the presence of expected future structural shocks in line with those estimated in the past.

Recent literature on regional branching proposes that new industries emerge in regions where preexisting economic activities are technologically related to the emerging industry. This article provides a more grounded basis for the emerging literature on regional branching by confronting the regional branching thesis with the realities of an emerging industry, namely, the fuel cell industry. The analysis is based on patent data and qualitative interviews conducted in a selection of European NUTS2 (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) regions. The findings can be summarized as follows. First, the analysis reveals that in the case of the emerging fuel cell industry, regional diversification is dominated by firm diversification, which complements previous studies' findings that entrepreneurial spin-offs dominate regional diversification. Second, the study corroborates the assumption that the process of regional branching relies on knowledge generated by nonindustrial actors such as universities and research institutes. Third, the findings suggest that care should be taken in ascribing the underlying logic of regional branching to the principle of technological relatedness alone. The article shows how some regional diversification processes occur in regions where preexisting economic activities are not technologically related to the emerging industry, for instance, when user industries apply new technologies to their product portfolio. The importance of further investigating and disentangling different dimensions of relatedness and their impact on regional branching is stressed.","[Tanner, Anne Nygaard] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Tanner, AN (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, Prod Torvet 426,Room 033B, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",anny@dtu.dk,"Tanner, Anne/ABF-7112-2021","Tanner, Anne Nygaard/0000-0002-3145-908X",,,,,83,115,130,5,87,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

These include policy limitations which may result in increases in accident risk, and CO2 emissions at traffic network level. In addition, the limitations of certain Eco-Driving technology are also highlighted.

A key goal in doing so has been to increase transit ridership by extending the geographic area from which riders can easily and quickly reach transit stops and stations. While it is widely hypothesized that being able to travel on transit vehicles with bicycles allows riders to access transit stops and stations from a larger geographic area, the empirical evidence of this is scanty. Information available for Northeast Ohio, where the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) operates rail, bus and demand response transit, presents an opportunity to address an important aspect of this issue. The availability of detailed long-term bicycle-on-bus boardings (BoBBs) data and the implementation of a series of service reductions in 2008, 2009 and 2010 offer an opportunity to ask the question: Do significant changes in geographic access to transit services result in significant changes to the numbers of cycle-transit users accessing transit buses? The evidence from GCRTA's service area provides some support for this conclusion, with the rates of utilization of bus bicycle racks increasing significantly over time and in slightly higher numbers for routes that saw the largest reductions in bus transit service.

Actual policy, which had been much more restrictive, adopted Bork's recommendation in the early 1980s. This paper examines the connection between this policy shift and concentration in the manufacturing sector. I find that concentration, which had been unchanged on average for all of the 20th century, began rising at the same time that merger policy changed. Concentration has increased steadily over the entire post-Bork period. The increase has been especially pronounced in consumer goods industries, which were already becoming more concentrated in the pre-Bork era. I find little difference in the underlying trends between already highly concentrated industries and the rest of manufacturing.

It focuses upon developments in seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century England, a site-specific genealogical moment in the broader history of state power/knowledges. Addressing a tendency in Foucauldian work to neglect pre-eighteenth-century governance, the analysis reveals a set of interrelated processes which gave rise to an innovative technique for anticipating hazard and opportunity for the state. At the intersection of raison d'etat, the evolving art of government, widespread routines of secrecy and a post-Westphalia field of European competition and exchange, intelligence was imagined as a fundamental solution to the concurrent problems of ensuring peace and stability while improving state forces. In the administrative offices of the English Secretary of State, an assemblage of complex and interrelated procedures sought to produce and manipulate information in ways which exposed both possible risks to the state and potential opportunities for expansion and gain. As this suggests, the art of intelligence played an important if largely unacknowledged role in the formation and growth of the early modern state. Ensuring strategic advantage over rivals, intelligence also limited the ability of England's neighbours to dominate trade, control the seas and master the colonies, functioning as a constitutive feature of European balance and equilibrium. As the analysis concludes, understanding intelligence as a form of governmental technique - a way of doing something - reveals an entirely novel way of thinking about and investigating its myriad (historical and contemporary) formations.","Univ Leeds, Sch Law, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Hutchinson, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Law, 2-01 Liberty Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",lawsh@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,5,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

An individual 'history' is a possible life that some person (a subject) might lead. Harsanyi supposes that a given spectator, formulating her ethical preferences, can rank histories by empathetic projection: putting herself 'in the shoes' of various subjects. Harsanyi then suggests that interpersonal comparisons be derived from the utility function representing spectators' (supposedly common) ranking of history lotteries. Unfortunately, Harsanyi's proposal has various flaws, including some that have hitherto escaped scholarly attention. In particular, it ignores the limits of personal identity. If the subject has welfare-relevant attributes that the spectator cannot acquire without changing who she is, full empathetic identification of the latter with the former becomes impossible. This paper proposes instead to use sympathy as the attitude on a spectator's part that allows us to make sense of her extended preferences. Sympathy - an attitude of care and concern - is a psychological state quite different from empathy. We should also allow for hetereogeneity in spectators' extended preferences. Interpersonal comparisons emerge from a plurality of sympathetic spectators, not (as per Harsanyi) from a common empathetic ranking.","Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Adler, MD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",adler@law.duke.edu,,,,,,,72,16,18,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

Comparatively, members of adult families' use public transport and walking more often than the private car and bicycle. And inhabitants of danwei neighbourhoods walk more often than residents in commodity housing estates.

We discuss their performances for nowcasting the quarterly growth rate of the Euro area GDP and its components, using a very large set of monthly indicators. We investigate the behaviors of single indicator models, forecast combinations and factor models, in a pseudo real-time framework. MIDAS with an AR component performs quite well, and outperforms MF-VAR at most horizons. Bridge equations perform well overall. Forecast pooling is superior to most of the single indicator models overall. Pooling information using factor models gives even better results. The best results are obtained for the components for which more economically related monthly indicators are available. Nowcasts of GDP components can then be combined to obtain nowcasts for the total GDP growth. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The economic conditions in early life are characterized using cyclical variations in annual real per capital gross domestic product during pregnancy and the first year of life. Exposure to recessions in early life appears to significantly increase cancer mortality risks of older males and females. It also significantly increases other mortality risks especially for older females. The residual life expectancies are up to about 8 and 6 % lower for male and female cancer mortality, respectively, and up to about 5 % lower for female cardiovascular mortality. Our analyses show that cardiovascular and cancer mortality risks are related and that not taking this association into account leads to biased inference.","[Yeung, Gary Y.

Even though corporatized firms are fairly common, little empirical work has tried to quantify the effects of corporatizations. This paper tries to fill this gap by analyzing the effect of corporatization on the price-setting behavior of public firms. The theoretical prediction that corporatization decreases political interference in price setting is tested using a dataset of Austrian water providers. The empirical evidence largely corroborates this hypothesis. Specifically, the results show that the impact of electoral cycles and intense political competition on price setting is significantly restrained in corporatized firms.","IAE Sorbonne Business Sch, F-75240 Paris 05, France",,"Klien, M (通讯作者)，IAE Sorbonne Business Sch, 21 Rue Broca, F-75240 Paris 05, France.",mcl.klien@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,14,15,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

J,"Murphy, S; Walsh, PP",,,,"Murphy, Susan; Walsh, Patrick Paul",,,Social Protection Beyond the Bottom Billion,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Most conceptualisations of the bottom billion assume that the poor are a minority group in a state of continuous dependency, identifiable by region and demographic. Using a flow analysis (inflow and outflow) of poverty, rather than a stock analysis, we explain why poverty is more appropriately understood as a dynamic, with the majority of people flowing in and out of poverty for short durations. Distinguishing between structural and transitory poverty gives rise to a focus on the identification of multiple constituencies in the wider population including the permanently poor; sometimes poor; and non-poor. External shocks, including economic and environmental shifts, and risks such as ill-health, can affect any individual, household, or population in a non-predictable way, and can lead to loss of livelihood and a decent into poverty for various durations. At any point in time the bottom billion is made up of a blend of both transitory and structural elements with the former reflecting poverty as a risk for a much wider population than is often assumed. Using this analysis, the total stock of poverty potentially entails up to 5.1 billion people who do not have access to comprehensive social protection systems and are therefore vulnerable to spells in poverty. To protect against shared risks and mutual vulnerabilities, this paper argues that global insurance instruments, regulated through domestic institutions, would provide an efficient solution to transitory poverty. Further, it argues that these instruments could provide a foundation for investment in more equitable and extensive social protection measures that could target the multiple dimensions of structural poverty thereby seeking to ensure that no one is left behind.","[Murphy, Susan] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Walsh, Patrick Paul] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Murphy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dublin 2, Ireland.",susan.p.murphy@tcd.ie; ppwalsh@ucd.ie,"Murphy, Susan/Q-4691-2019; Walsh, Patrick Paul/AAG-5085-2019; Murphy, Susan P/N-4611-2015","Murphy, Susan/0000-0002-2270-9198; Walsh, Patrick Paul/0000-0003-0739-8835; Murphy, Susan P/0000-0002-2270-9198",,,,,24,2,2,0,8,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The theory of the consumerism life cycle shows that the CAC as the spearhead of grassroots consumer activism in Canada was able to address effectively consumer concerns at both the administrative and policymaking levels of government. Analysis of the rise and fall of consumerism in post-WWII Canada from the perspective of the consumerism life cycle also might well have implications for the further development of that theory.,"[Sadovnikova, Anna] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Mikhailitchenko, Andrey] Calif State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Long Beach, CA USA; [Shapiro, Stanley J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Beedie Sch Business, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",McMaster University; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Simon Fraser University,"Sadovnikova, A (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",sadovna@mcmaster.ca; mikhaili@csus.edu; sshapiro@sfu.ca,"Mikhailitchenko, Andrey/I-4976-2017","Mikhailitchenko, Andrey/0000-0002-6795-3098",,,,,75,5,5,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Based on the embedded nature of ASW, the role of Japanese automobiles in the USA and the advantage of using patenting in large third countries as a good proxy measure for national innovation activities, we employ ASW-related patents in the USPTO patent database as an indicator of ASW product innovation. Through analysing the heterogeneities of product innovation in terms of function and actors' innovation activities over the period 1981-2010 by classifying ASW functions into fields of power train control, battery and electric power control, safety control, body control and information communication and telecommunication system, we extract the product innovation typology of ESW and conclude that the heterogeneous requirements for real-time operation and accumulation of specific knowledge are the main reasons of heterogeneity of product innovation in ESW.

The findings suggest that some Chinese airports experienced productivity regress, and should improve their efficiency both in terms of management and scale. By identifying the individual airports that experienced a bias in the production of the relative output of passengers and cargo, this research found that some airports are suitable for developing passenger services, while others might be more suitable for cargo. The empirical results also show that 22 airports experienced runway-using and terminal-saving input bias, 15 airports experienced runway-saving/terminal-using input bias, and 4 airports experienced neutral technological change.","[Chang, Yu-Chun; Yu, Ming-Miin] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Transportat Sci, Coll Maritime Sci & Management, Keelung 202, Taiwan",National Taiwan Ocean University,"Yu, MM (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Transportat Sci, Coll Maritime Sci & Management, Keelung 202, Taiwan.",yumm@mail.ntou.edu.tw,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,14,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

We explore this possibility using historical variation in federal judicial rulings regarding whether Chapter 13 bankruptcy filers could reduce the principal owed on a home loan to the home's market value. The practice, known as cramdown, was definitively prohibited by the Supreme Court in 1993. We find that home loans closed during the time when cramdown was allowed had interest rates 12-16 basis points higher than loans closed in the same state when cramdown was not allowed, which translates to a roughly 1 percent increase in monthly payments. Consistent with the theory that lenders are pricing in the risk of principal modification, interest rate increases are higher for the riskiest borrowers and zero for the least risky and higher in states where Chapter 13 filing is more common.","[Goodman, Joshua] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Levitin, Adam] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Harvard University; Georgetown University,"Goodman, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Goodman, Joshua/K-9256-2019","Goodman, Joshua/0000-0002-3650-2075; Levitin, Adam/0000-0002-1680-0788",,,,,23,10,10,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Using independent methodologies, we distinguish between the scientific knowledge set and the technical knowledge set, and separate these from other kinds of prior expertise. We find that the patents of the inventors who have a prior scholarly knowledge of the topic are on average more important (more cited after 6 years). Conversely, we find an inverted U-shape relationship between prior technical relatedness and patent importance. These results are potentially useful to support the work of practitioners such as university technology managers, which often face difficulties in identifying the importance and perspective value of the disclosed inventions, amid high market and legal uncertainty and budget shortages.","[Mohammadi, Ali; Franzoni, Chiara] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Mohammadi, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, P Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",ali.mohammadi@polimi.it,"Mohammadi, Ali/M-8274-2014; Mohammadi, Ali/AAP-9433-2021; Franzoni, Chiara/AAH-3119-2019","Mohammadi, Ali/0000-0001-9348-7505; Mohammadi, Ali/0000-0001-9348-7505; Franzoni, Chiara/0000-0002-6092-0074",,,,,54,6,6,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The suitability of cost benefit analysis (CBA) for answering this need has been studied in recent research: an analysis of participant perceptions in the Netherlands showed several problematic process issues when assessing integrated transportation plans with CBA (Beukers et al., 2012). CBA was perceived by the participants as a final test, in contrast to the desired outcome of using CBA as a learning tool to optimize the plans. Furthermore, the two main groups of participants (plan owners and evaluators) appeared to hold different and sometimes clashing rationales. This clash was expressed through lack of communication and mutual trust. Using a literature review of the fields of deliberative planning and organizational learning to explore how to improve communication and build trust, this paper provides a deeper understanding of the process issues at hand and contends that strong communication and trust between plan owners and evaluators are crucial conditions for employing CBA as a learning tool. Finally, based on these theoretical insights, this paper proposes an approach for supporting the practical use of CBA as a learning tool. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a variety of models explaining relationship between income and wellbeing, but results sometimes are not complimentary, many authors indicate that additional research is needed Therefore, we have chosen to examine the relationship between household income and subjective wellbeing in two countries, which differ in levels of happiness and income significantly. Various studies, including World Value Survey, indicate Lithuania is among the countries demonstrating the lowest scores on happiness of population, while Denmark demonstrates the highest scores of happiness. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between income and subjective wellbeing in Lithuania, and to compare it with the relationship between income and subjective wellbeing in Denmark. This paper presents some results of the survey which was conducted in 2014 in Lithuania (n=916) and Denmark (n=1282). The results demonstrated some positive correlations between income and subjective Wellbeing factors in both samples, even though some significant differences were found. The analysis of Lithuanian data has demonstrated that the higher the net income is per month, the higher the subjective wellbeing is, overall satisfaction with life. Respondents in the higher net income groups reported stronger and more frequent positive emotional states and weaker / less recurrent negative or suicidal states, to compare with the lower net income groups. The results showed similar emotional wellbeing tendencies in the Danes' sample. However, the differences in he satisfaction on the whole between low and high household net income groups were not statistically significant in the Danish sample. This research contributes to the income - happiness relatedness model, and the results are in line with the findings that the relationship between income and wellbeing is more strong and significant in poorer groups or societies. However, the deeper analysis of related factors and comparison of the highest and lowest income groups in both samples could contribute to better understanding of the relationship between income and subjective wellbeing.","[Dirzyte, Aiste] Mykolas Riomeris Univ, Inst Psychol, Fac Social Technol, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Nygaard, Simon Elsborg] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Rakauskiene, Ona] Mykolas Riomeris Univ, Inst Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Finance Management, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Aarhus University; Mykolas Romeris University,"Dirzyte, A (通讯作者)，Mykolas Riomeris Univ, Inst Psychol, Fac Social Technol, Ateities Str 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",aiste.dirzyte@gmail.com; Simon.Elsborg.Nygaard@psy.au.dk; ona.rakaus@mruni.eu,"Nygaard, Simon/G-6248-2019; Dirzyte, Aiste/ABH-6807-2020","Dirzyte, Aiste/0000-0003-2057-3108",,,,,54,1,1,3,35,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

DAELasso achieves variable selection and coefficient shrinkage in a databased manner. It deals constructively with explanatory variables which tend to be highly collinear by encouraging the grouping effect. In addition, it also allows for different degrees of shrinkage for different coefficients. Rewriting the multivariate Laplace distribution as a scale mixture, we establish closed-form conditional posteriors that can be drawn from a Gibbs sampler. An empirical analysis shows that the forecast results produced by DAELasso and its variants are comparable to those from other popular Bayesian methods, which provides further evidence that the forecast performances of large and medium sized Bayesian VARs are relatively robust to prior choices, and, in practice, simple Minnesota types of priors can be more attractive than their complex and well-designed alternatives.

Moreover, the traditional association of private labels solely with a price focus, to the detriment of quality, appears to be diminishing. This research aims to clarify the effect of price sensitivity toward and quality perceptions of private labels on private label consumption. It analyzes the role of a retailer's price positioning as a moderator of the importance of these effects as determinants of private label purchases. With household panel data and survey information, this study investigates private labels' share of wallet as the dependent variable; thus the logit-type model is adapted to a resource allocation context. Five sequential models specify and test the four hypotheses. In support of the hypotheses, price sensitivity and quality perceptions relate positively to private label consumption. For the moderating effect of retailer's price positioning, a negative moderating effect arises for price sensitivity, whereas a positive moderating effect appears for quality perceptions of private labels. The findings indicate that retailers' efforts to convert private labels into tools to support positioning strategies are effective.","[Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar; Martos-Partal, Mercedes] Univ Salamanca, Dept Adm & Econ Empresa, Salamanca 37007, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Martos-Partal, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Adm & Econ Empresa, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",oscargb@usal.es; mmartos@usal.es,"Martos-Partal, Mercedes/W-4166-2019; Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar/K-4673-2014","Martos-Partal, Mercedes/0000-0002-0390-3358; Gonzalez-Benito, Oscar/0000-0002-0586-556X",,,,,66,5,5,5,52,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The aim of this paper is to analyse to what extent do the fluctuations of the rate of exchange impact on the dynamics of the commercial flows, in reference to the evolution of Romanian imports and exports. Analysing these connections, we will notice the ambivalent link between the nominal and real economy. Using both the quantitative and qualitative approach, we will try to answer the following question: Have competitive devaluations integrated or disintegrated commercial flows? The results of this research are statistically significant, accentuating the liberal noninterventionist optics regarding the evolution of the exchange rate.","[Ignat, Ion; Iavorschi, Mihaela] Al Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Ignat, I (通讯作者)，Al Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania.",,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,2,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93691-3-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,624,634,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BC6CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353772100084,0

The aim of this paper is to introduce and describe the changes of the Slovak industrial structure in details from the times of the federative Czechoslovakia, which existed before the change of regime in 1989, to the current period when there is an independent Slovak Republic. Special attention is given to the analysis of transformation with regards to sectoral and ownership changes as well as to changes in the types of goods produced along with the transformation of the spatial and employment structure in Eastern Slovakia. The degree of industrial development or in some cases underdevelopment can be different in each region. These phenomena and their causes are analysed in this paper on the basis of regional macroeconomic indicators. The results of the research prove our basic hypothesis that there are significant disparities between the different regions of Slovakia, which are based on the presence or non-presence of industrial production in a concrete area. In spite of efforts to obtain a better position in industrial hierarchy, Eastern Slovakia still lags behind other Slovak regions in development and will have to deal with and solve several issues in order to catch up.","[Machova, Renata; Hevesi, Andrej] J Selye Univ, Fac Econ, Bratislavska Cesta 3322, Komarno 94501, Slovakia; [Balintova, Monika] J Selye Univ, Komarno, Slovakia",J.

Observations carried out in developed markets show that dividend initiation decisions result in an increase of abnormal returns. The main objective of this paper is to present results of shareholders' reaction to the dividend initiation decisions and an impact of market cycles on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). At the beginning, a review of similar studies is made. Next, the sample selection and methodology were discussed. The shareholders' reactions for the whole sample were positive but abnormal returns under two models were different and not homogeneous in the event window (-60, +60). In the case of over 45% of dividend initiations the reaction was negative. Moreover, the author have indicated that observed market business cycles may influence shareholders' reactions and abnormal returns.","Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Financial Management, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Perepeczo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Financial Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",agnieszka.perepeczo@wneiz.pl,"Preś-Perepeczo, Agnieszka/ABA-3361-2020","Preś-Perepeczo, Agnieszka/0000-0002-1080-7989",,,,,15,3,3,0,9,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The debate raises questions regarding the fairness of the patent system, the validity of many types of patents, the rights of the haves versus the have nots, and whether patents are fostering or harming innovation. The debate focuses on a handful of issues: are there too many patents, are there non-navigable patent thickets, do these thickets cause a holdup problem for new innovators and implementers, do the royalties that need to be paid for several patents covering a single product stack together to form prohibitive royalty rates, how should reasonable licensing terms and damages for patents be defined, and so forth.

Therefore, social capital can be seen as an instrument in the activation of endogenous development potential of local communities, especially in peripheral regions.","[Pilecek, Jan; Chromy, Pavel; Jancak, Vit] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Fac Sci, Prague 12843, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Pilecek, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Fac Sci, Albertov 6, Prague 12843, Czech Republic.",hopilec@atlas.cz; chromy@natur.cuni.cz; jancak@natur.cuni.cz,"Chromý, Pavel/GWR-1895-2022",,,,,,74,23,24,5,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Where and how older people live will affect patterns of travel associated with their lifestyles and needs. They may remain in their own homes, those of relatives or in residential care homes. They may make minimal or extensive use of technologies. As such, assistive technologies represent an example of technological developments and their social uptake outside the field of transport. Such developments may, nevertheless, have an indirect impact on travel demand and one which may be quite substantial. This paper aims, through a series of expert interviews, to examine: (i) to what extent the mobility effects of technological developments (outside transport) are being considered within the transport sector; (ii) how important or relevant it is for such consideration to be given; and (iii) ways in which such impacts can be accounted for in travel demand analysis and policy decisions. What emerges is that such indirect impacts are considered very important but rarely are they examined. The transport experts interviewed noted various ways of increasing the integration between transport and other domains. Several saw more emphasis on these issues in the education of transport professionals as an important starting point. The paper concludes with the case for using scenario planning as a means to emphasise how the living arrangements for older people, facilitated through assistive technologies, could produce distinct and significant consequences for travel demand.

While concluding that these benefits could not be given standing, Elvik resorted to argumentation from normative theories outside the schools of economic theory. In this article, we present arguments for omitting violators' benefits, or lost benefits, based on normative stands within economics school of thought. By means of two examples, we illustrate the distinction between a project of increased/improved enforcement of existing speed limits, where violators' time losses should not be included - compatible with Elvik's point of view - and a project of reduced speed limits, where the time loss should be included. This clarification of standing in cost-benefit analysis of road safety measures is based on the economics school of thought, where cost-benefit analysis is regarded as a decision tool operating within social constraints and where speed limits are considered as absolute institutions.

It focuses on Italian municipalities, where a single ballot system applies to municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabitants, while a dual ballot system applies above that threshold. By exploiting this discontinuity, the paper finds that the dual ballot increases participation at the local polls by about 1 percentage point. The increase in voter turnout is associated with broader political representation, higher quality politicians, and greater fiscal discipline.

Yet there is still no consensus on which are the effects of such type of activism on child labor in developing countries. In fact, if some agreement is to be found in the recent economic literature, it is that the boycott does not reduce child labor. We contribute to this discussion presenting a simple model which shows that there are conditions under which a consumer boycott reduces child labor. We consider a small country two-factor economy populated by heterogeneous households. The boycott affects both the adult and the child labor markets. We show that the effects are heterogeneous and depend on household characteristics and on the income distribution. We derive the conditions under which the consumer boycott reduces child labor not only for nonpoor households but also for some of the households whose' income is-before the boycott-under the subsistence level.","[Di Maio, Michele; Fabbri, Giorgio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, Naples, Italy; [Di Maio, Michele; Fabbri, Giorgio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Fabbri, G (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ Studies, Naples, Italy.",giorgio.fabbri@uniparthenope.it,"Fabbri, Giorgio/O-9848-2019","Fabbri, Giorgio/0000-0003-3316-8929; Di Maio, Michele/0000-0003-2622-6780",,,,,34,3,6,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The filing of a PI and the court's ruling generate information that can impact settlement. We find that some plaintiffs request a PI to signal bounds on their damages in order to elicit better settlement offers. As a result, the parties are more likely to come to an out-of-court agreement permitting the disputed activity, compared to when a PI is motivated solely by defensive reasons to avert immediate damages during trial. Although the grant of a PI reduces ex post incentives for potential litigants to settle, this is more than offset by an increase in settlement upon a denial. Thus, ex ante, learning leads to more settlement. Nevertheless, the anticipation of learning and increased chances of settlement do not affect the initial filing decision.","[Jeitschko, Thomas D.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kim, Byung-Cheol] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Michigan State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,,jeitschk@msu.edu,"Jeitschko, Thomas/O-7318-2019; Jeitschko, Thomas/G-3290-2013","Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235; Jeitschko, Thomas/0000-0001-5903-3235",,,,,23,7,7,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

The outputs for each scenario were used as input in weighted goal programming. By using the significance of goals which determined by opinion of experts, the pair-wise comparison procedure has been done. The results of WGP determine the scenario with the highest possible utility. This integrated methodology has been applied in the city of Isfahan (Iran).

Meanwhile Dutch geographers took note of the efforts of Haushofer and his circle. Around 1930, their initial reaction to this project took various forms - constructive criticism, co-operation and indignant dismissal - but the attention waned over the decade. During the occupation Nazi-friendly geographers discussed the launching of a new geopolitics. The generally shared Dutch preference for aloofness, neutrality and recourse to international law as the way to approach international relations precluded the formation of a large, responsive public for German geopolitics.

Despite the rich theoretical discourse on these 'wars', it remains unclear which territories are competing with each other over which types of investments. Combining insights from international economics, international business, and urban geography, we develop an indicator to measure revealed competition between territories for investments based on the overlap of investment portfolios of regions. Taking competition for greenfield investments between European regions as a test subject, we identify competitive market segments, derive the competitive threat a region faces from other regions, the competitive threat regions pose to other regions, and the most important market segments in which regions compete. We show that European regions with similar locational endowments pose a fiercer competitive threat to one another. Regions that are sufficiently large and distinctive face the smallest average competitive threat from all other regions.","[Burger, Martijn J.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Tinbergen Inst, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Burger, Martijn J.] ERIM, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Knaap, Bert] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wall, Ronald S.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies IHS, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Burger, MJ (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, H13-11,POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mburger@ese.eur.nl,"Wall, Ronald/AAF-2228-2019","Wall, Ronald/0000-0003-2783-4294",,,,,86,48,49,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This paper provides for the first time an insight into the magnitude of the effects of this kind of commuting subsidy under different funding schemes. The economic and spatial effects are calculated by applying a spatial CGE approach calibrated to a German urban area. The findings suggest that effects on urban sprawl characterized by suburbanization, spatial expansion of the city, and increasing commuting distance are surprisingly small. Concerning welfare, we found that the current level of tax deductions in Germany is too small in the case of income tax funding. If one considers further changes in the tax system welfare can be considerably enhanced by raising tax deductions above that level. In particular this refers to a tax structure where energy taxes are used to make traveling by car less attractive and tax deductions are used to lower the negative impact of taxes on labor supply.

This survey was undertaken in order to be able to understand how congestion pricing could be used to help manage airspace capacity. This is an important question since a 2008 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress suggested that domestic air traffic delays in 2007 cost the economy as much as $41 billion, including $19 billion in increased operational costs for the airlines and $12 billion worth of lost time for passengers. The paper begins by surveying roadway congestion approaches throughout the world. We survey the successes that peak pricing charges have had on reducing congestion. We also report the other benefits that such practices have had: improving the public transportation network, improving the economy of the region, reducing carbon emissions, and creating new urban living spaces. We next examine other applications of congestion pricing, including managing demand for canal and bridges passage, port usage, access to city centers, and peak use of energy resources. The paper ends with a proposal for a two-staged approach to the management of air space and runway congestion. The first stage imposes a service standard on runway access that is consistent with an airport's capacity during good weather days. Then, when weather reduces capacity either in the airspace or on runways, we propose a congestion pricing mechanism that charges flights based on the amount of congestion the flight imposes on the entire system.

What explains the difference? Focusing primarily on the French case and its Belgian facsimile, we seek to underscore the role of social theorists in legitimizing bans on the full veil. Ironically, this role has been largely disregarded by Anglophone theorists who write on the veil, and who often oppose its prohibition. This article suggests that Europe tends to be more repressive towards full veils because its political process is more open to multiple theoretical representations of the phenomenon of veiling. Conversely, the United States is more open to the provocative display of religious symbols in public because the political process is pre-structured by legal conventions that tend to filter out social theory. The push to ban the burqa in France principally derives from its brand of republicanism rather than being a product of racism and Islamophobia. Of particular significance in the French case is the emphasis on reciprocity as a political principle, a principle that is elongated into an ideal of sociability by French theorists in different disciplines. The arguments of these theorists are described, their rationale is explained and the impact of their intervention on the policy process is documented. The French case, where the popular press and legislature play a major role in shaping policy towards the burqa, is contrasted with that of the United States, where the judiciary, defending religious freedom, remains the most influential collective actor. Each country has correspondingly different attitudes to democracy. In France, the mission of democracy is to extend political equality to the social realm whereas in the United States it is religion that is prioritized so as to protect that which is deemed most sacred to the individual.","[Baehr, Peter] Lingnan Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Baehr, Peter] Lingnan Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gordon, Daniel] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Hist, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Lingnan University; Lingnan University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Baehr, P (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, Castle Peak Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",pbaehr@ln.edu.hk; dgordon@history.umass.edu,,"BAEHR, William Peter/0000-0001-7921-7162",,,,,69,15,18,0,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

According to the property rights theory, the allocation of residual rights of control (decision and ownership rights) in franchise firms depends on the contractibility of system-specific and local market assets (LMA). We develop and test the following hypotheses: Multi-unit franchising (MUF) is positively related to the franchisor's intangible system-specific assets and negatively to the franchisee's intangible LMA. In addition, we argue that impact of financial assets on the tendency toward MUF depends on the contractibility of LMA. Empirical results from the German franchise sector provide partial support of the hypotheses. Compared to the agency theory, which focuses on (complete) incentive contracts that specify residual income rights between the franchisor and franchisee, property rights theory focuses on incomplete contracts that allocate residual control rights between the franchisor and network partners. Furthermore, compared to the resource scarcity theory, property rights theory explains the impact of contractibility of resources/assets on the ownership strategy of the franchise firm.","[Hussain, Dildar] ESC Rennes Sch Business, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Windsperger, Josef] Univ Vienna, Ctr Business Studies, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business; University of Vienna,"Hussain, D (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert Arbrissel, F-35000 Rennes, France.",dildar.hussain@esc-rennes.fr; josef.windsperger@univie.ac.at,,"windsperger, josef/0000-0002-3413-5160; Hussain, Dildar/0000-0002-2431-6312",,,,,66,8,9,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Areas served by Transmilenio, especially those in the periphery that have been provided with feeder bus routes, have a higher growth than zones without access to this system. Using a similar methodology for assessing the growth of newly built areas, we have not found a clear relation between the BRT and recent evolution of residential, commercial, or work areas.

This is remarkable, as entrepreneurs often suggest that real estate characteristics at the property level provide an explanation for firm relocation behaviour in addition to more-frequently tested drivers of firm relocation. We assess the role of real estate determinants, focusing on firms in urban residential neighbourhoods, differentiating between firms located in residential and commercial properties. We find that property ownership is negatively related to relocation likelihood, while being located in property with multiple users is positively related to relocation likelihood. For firms in residential properties high property age and large property size limits firm relocation. Our findings confirm that real estate characteristics are important determinants for relocation likelihood of firms, suggesting that the structure of neighbourhood housing stocks can be linked to the mobility pattern of local firms.","[Risselada, Anne; Schutjens, Veronique; Van Oort, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, URU, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Risselada, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, URU, P Box 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",A.H.Risselada@uu.nl; V.A.J.M.Schutjens@uu.nl; F.G.vanOort@uu.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X",,,,,64,14,19,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Applying the European Community Merger Regulation valid at the time of decision and empirical evidence available in 2001, the relevant markets are defined taking into account demand-side substitutability and supply-side substitutability. The worldwide bidding markets for large regional jet aircraft engines, corporate jet aircraft engines and small marine gas turbines are characterised by potentially volatile market shares, high importance of after-sales revenue and profitable outside options. According to the two-level approach of the European Commission, the analysis considers firstly the competitive situation of the engine manufacturer in relation to its direct customer, the aircraft or marine vessel manufacturer, and secondly the competitive effects in the respective market of end-use applications.

The results quantify the losses suffered by Toyota vehicle owners in secondary markets due to the 2009-2010 safety recalls of more than 9 million Toyota Motors vehicles. The treatment effect of a recall is measured using panel data with a difference-in-differences estimation approach that allows for time-varying treatment effects and serial correlation. I find that this recall episode had negative effects in the resale market for automobiles that were quantitatively small (less than 2% of the vehicle's resale value), statistically indistinguishable from zero, and short lived (did not persist beyond December 2009). A comparison with Audi's recalls in the 1980s of vehicles with sudden unintended acceleration suggests that the extent to which a company's reputation is established is more important than whether or not a company has a reputation for producing high-quality products.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Hammond, RG (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",robert_hammond@ncsu.edu,,,,,,,36,5,6,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The merging companies based their economic model of the merger on estimates of efficiencies derived from AT&T's engineering model, without addressing the credibility of the results of the latter in the context of the economics literature on the telecommunications sector. This article argues that the economics literature on economies of scale (especially) and economies of density in mobile telephony and elsewhere suggests caution in expecting such massive cost reductions from increasing the size of an already very large firm.

Nonetheless, more than nine million families still do not participate in the financial mainstream, and roughly half these unbanked families previously held a traditional bank account. This study uses the 2004 longitudinal Survey of Income Program Participation to examine the dynamic process within which changes in families' circumstances contribute to their becoming unbanked. Our findings suggest that families are significantly more likely to become unbanked when there is a decline in family income, loss of employment, or loss of health insurance coverage. Race and ethnicity, level of education or family income, and marital or housing status are also important determinants of whether families participate in the financial mainstream or not.

Over 50% of land sales concerned land areas below 0.50 hectares, whereas just 1% of the overall land sold was larger than 10 hectares. Nearly 75% of sample observations were represented by land sales smaller than 1 hectare. The average land area per purchase was just over 1 hectare. The overall money exchanged in the whole period amounted to nearly 6 million euro, with an average price per sale equal to 16,339.45 (sic), and an average unitary price of 15,000 (sic)/hectare. The results of regression analysis showed that the adopted model explained around 2/3 of land price variability, and the estimates of the regression coefficients concerning land use areas were statistically significant. The unitary price analysis did not provide acceptable results, apparently because some independent variables were missing, due to their tied links with some physical factors of the investigated area. The use of a GIS-based analysis allowed us to gain an insight into Corleone land market activity through a graphical representation of several images concerning spatial and time dynamics of land sales, represented by size, land use and unitary market price.","[Asciuto, Antonio; D'acquisto, Marcello; Di Gesaro, Mariarosa; Schimmenti, Emanuele] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento DEMETRA, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,,antonio.asciuto@unipa.it,"Asciuto, Antonio/ABB-3819-2020; Asciuto, Antonio/IAM-2785-2023; Schimmenti, Emanuele/L-8917-2015","Schimmenti, Emanuele/0000-0001-7376-7606",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MEDIMOND S R L,40128 BOLOGNA,"VIA MASERATI 5, 40128 BOLOGNA, 00000, ITALY",,,978-88-7587-690-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,13,26,,,,,,14,Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Geography,BA8IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000338155900002,0

It also examines how ownership types moderate the HR slack-performance relationship. The longitudinal data-set of 11,985 firms-year observations from 2000-2009 were used and generalized linear models (GLMs) employed for analyzing data. The findings reveal that (1) absolute HR slack (AHRS) leads to enhance firm performance; (2) AHRS is positively and relative HR slack (RHRS) is negatively affected firm performance; (3) both AHRS and RHRS have inverse U-shaped effects on firm performance. (4) AHRS is positively influenced on performance of both state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and private-owned enterprises (POEs). RHRS is negatively affect performance of SOEs. It can be concluded that both absolute and relative HR slacks lead to increase the firm performance up to a certain level, thereafter, firm performance is declined (Curvilinear relationship).

Findings showed that most heads of the families of obese children were also obese; extremely poor families and children over 15 years old revealed a more sedentary lifestyle; lastly, the mothers generally did not participate in deciding on the food purchases and had no notions whatsoever about balanced nutrition that would allow them to plan the purchase of food.

After the introduction of copayments the number of prescriptions filled decreased by 29%. At the same time, however, total expenditures on prescription drugs dropped only in the first quarter of the post-introduction period and then returned to previous levels. This was partially due to behavioral responses of patients and physicians: strategic shift of prescription purchases to the time right before the introduction of reform, prescription of more packages on one prescription and an upward shift in the price composition of prescribed drugs. Moreover, patients in general decided to forego those types of drugs that did not cause immediate worsening of health status.","[Hromadkova, Eva] Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hromadkova, Eva; Zdenek, Michal] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Zdenek, Michal] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Hromádková, E (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic.",Eva.Hromadkova@cerge-ei.cz; michal.zdenek@cerge-ei.cz,,,Wilhelm Keilhaus's Fund; Norges Bank Research Fund,Wilhelm Keilhaus's Fund; Norges Bank Research Fund,"The authors would like to thank Randall K.

The main novelty of this study is threefold. First, the underlying dataset is based on monthly wood supply. This enables an analysis of seasonal supply behavior, which is found to be different in relation to the size of the forestland. Second, it represents an original study with a dataset from a Central European country whose forest owners are apparently much more fragmented than their Scandinavian or North American counterparts. And third, the study introduces a windfall variable that effectively corrects for a market-relevant storm event. With respect to methodology, a random effects Tobit model is applied. Additionally, a Chamberlain-like term is included in the regression to deal with a possible bias generated through the correlation of regressors and unobserved heterogeneity.

The results show that, for particular data series, hierarchical shrinkage dominates factor model forecasts, and hence serves as a valuable addition to the existing methods for handling large dimensional data.

The demand in each intraday period is modeled using semiparametric regression smoothing to account for calendar and weather components. Residual serial dependence is captured by one of two multivariate stationary time series models, with a dimension equal to the number of intraday periods. These are a periodic autoregression and a dynamic factor model. We show the benefits of our approach in the forecasting of (a) district heating demand in a steam network in Germany and (b) aggregate electricity demand in the state of Victoria, Australia. In both studies, accounting for weather can improve the forecast quality substantially, as does the use of time series models. We compare the effectiveness of the periodic autoregression with three variations of the dynamic factor model, and find that the dynamic factor model consistently provides more accurate forecasts. Overall, our approach combines many of the features which have previously been shown to provide high quality forecasts of energy demand over horizons of up to one week, as well as introducing some novel ones.

Despite ample empirical evidence pointing out to service quality, customer satisfaction, perceived value as the main drivers of customer loyalty and numerous examinations of their interrelatedness and relative impact on customer behavioral intentions, vast majority of previous studies have been conducted in the U.S. and western country context, whereas developing economies have largely been neglected. This especially pertains to Serbia and its increasingly competitive retailing industry. Therefore the overriding objective of this paper is to examine complex interrelationships among service quality, satisfaction, value and their relative impact on customer behavioral intentions in Serbian grocery retail context. In line with frequently highlighted context and culture-specific nature of service quality construct and due to the dearth of empirical studies of service quality in Serbian retail setting, literature review and group discussions with retail customers were perfomed first. Qualitative research yielded initial pool of service quality items, which was later on refined on the basis of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and validated applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Quantitative analysis proceeded with the examination of structural relationships among key service evaluation constructs. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.80. According to the study's findings customer satisfaction, influenced by perceptions of service quality and value, exerts the strongest total effect on customer behavioral intentions, followed by perceived value and service quality.

Publicly traded timber REITs have better liquidity and tax efficiency than private ownership, but at the same time, they are exposed to higher market risk as public firms. In this study, copula modeling is employed to assess the joint distribution between daily returns of five timber REITs and a stock market index. Both constant and time-varying symmetrized Joe-Clayton copulas are estimated to evaluate the dependence of timber REITs on the equity market from 1994 to 2010. In most cases, there exist lower tail dependence for market stresses, upper tail dependence for market booms, and tail asymmetry between individual firms and the market. On average, the dependence measure becomes larger after a firm is converted into a REIT. Each firm has smaller volatility of tail dependence after the conversion, except for Plum Creek. These findings reveal that the REIT structure has introduced non-diversifiable market risk into its ownership, and thus the diversification benefit of publicly traded timber REITs in a portfolio may be limited.

Understanding the possible reasons for any bias is important if information is to be extracted from earnings forecasts and used optimally by investors. Extant research into the shape of analysts' loss functions explains optimism bias as resulting from analysts minimizing the mean absolute forecast error under symmetric, linear loss functions. When the distribution of earnings outcomes is skewed, optimalforecasts can appear biased. In contrast, research into analysts' economic incentives suggests that positive and negative earnings forecast errors made by analysts are not penalized or rewarded symmetrically, suggesting that asymmetric loss functions are an appropriate characterization. To reconcile these findings, we exploit results from economic theory relating to the Linex loss function to discriminate between the symmetric linear loss and the asymmetric loss explanations of analyst forecast bias. Under asymmetric loss functions optimal forecasts will appear biased even if earnings outcomes are symmetric. Our empirical results support the asymmetric loss function explanation. Further analysis also reveals that forecast bias varies systematically across firm characteristics that capture systematic variation in the earnings forecast error distribution.

J,"O'Riain, S",,,,"O'Riain, Sean",,,The Crisis of Financialisation in Ireland,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper explores the intersection of national and transnational processes in shaping Ireland's financial crisis. It uses insights from economic sociology to reconcile the analytical tension between an understanding of Ireland's crisis in terms of the unfolding of an international process and explanations that focus on specific national features. A series of significant policy decisions in the late 1990s favoured financial markets in allocating capital and opened up significant institutional space for speculative lending. Underneath the apparently consistent expansion of the property lending bubble since the mid-1990s, there was a significant shift in investment logics from the early 2000s as both residential and commercial real estate spending became detached from underlying demand. This shift in logic was based on two significant translations of investment rationalities into justifications of lending and investment that underpinned the bubble. Irish banks' own conceptions of risk and rational investments shifted subtly over time so that property lending was translated into a rational investment, encouraged by market dynamics such as increased bank profits, rising share prices and concentration of decision making power in the banking system. At the same time, and in the context of the establishment of the euro, investing in the assets of Irish banks was translated into a rational investment for international banks, in large part through the metrics of the credit ratings agencies. The paper concludes by revisiting the question of how we should understand the specifics of particular financial crises in conjunction with the general dynamics of financialisation - pointing to the importance of translation processes in creating social rationalities and the significance of market liberalism as a social formation in enabling these translations and promoting financialisation.","Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"O'Riain, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",Sean.ORiain@nuim.ie,,"O Riain, Sean/0000-0001-9839-6397",,,,,42,25,27,0,26,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

J,"Koterski, J",,,,"Koterski, Joseph",,,Human Nature from a Catholic Perspective,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Catholic views on personhood and human nature include emphasis on the dignity of each person, from womb to tomb. The claims made for this inviolable dignity invariably stem from the recognition that all human beings, regardless of their state of dependency, are made in the image of God and are thus the bearers of certain moral rights. But in our fallen state that image is wounded and needs to be repaired. Hence, Christians need to learn to recapitulate the life of Christ in their own lives by growing through the stages of human life according to the model that He presents to us. There are not only individual but corporate aspects to this growth. Catholic Social Teaching offers insights on the corporate and social condition in which we find ourselves. It has a healthy respect for the economic laws of the market and for the technical intricacies of efficient decision-making processes in local, national, and world economies, but out of respect for human nature there are moral norms that need to be respected and that may never be violated. On the topic of property and private ownership, considerable attention is given to the very purpose of private property (namely, to provide individuals with a kind of independence that enhances their ability to do their duties to their dependence and that extends their freedom). But always correlated with this defense of private property is a sense of the social demands on private property that come from the common good and the communal purpose of all earthly goods.","Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Fordham University,"Koterski, J (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

However, some areas still needing improvement include relatively neutral views that their diet is very healthy and that they only snack on healthy foods. While there are a number of improvements in parents' attitudes and behaviors regarding a healthy diet, the majority of the ground gained was early, from 2002 to between 2003 and 2006.

The radical innovation may yield lucrative financial returns but entails significant technological and market-related uncertainties. It is also particularly attractive to the rival entrant: if the market for it pans out, such an innovation obsoletes the existing technology and any incremental improvements to it. Each firm has its own assessment of the market potential for the radical innovation, and the reliability of these market forecasts can differ. We show that when the entrants market-assessment capability is weak, the incumbent will pursue incremental innovation and postpone its plans to develop radical innovation even when it thinks highly of the market potential for the radical innovation. The incumbent does so to avoid validating the high market potential to the entrant, who may otherwise be encouraged to invest aggressively. The incumbent thus prefers to look soft with respect to its innovation strategy in order to discourage entry. Even if its innovation strategy is not observable, we show that an incumbent that assesses the commercial potential for a radical innovation favorably may pursue an incremental path and communicate its plans publicly; this strategy serves to reduce entry by affecting the entrants beliefs about the market potential of the innovation. Finally, we extend the model to investigate the entrants decision to communicate its innovation intentions. We find that the entrant communicates its plans to aggressively pursue radical innovation only if the incumbents market-assessment capabilities are strong. In doing so, the entrant acts preemptively to discourage the incumbent from pursuing the radical innovation, and is less concerned with validating market potential.","[Turut, Ozge] Sabanci Univ, Sch Management, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ofek, Elie] Harvard Sch Business, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Sabanci University; Harvard University,"Turut, O (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Sch Management, Istanbul, Turkey.",ozget@sabanciuniv.edu; eofek@hbs.edu,,,,,,,47,4,5,0,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

We analyze weekly price data for approximately 250 goods from 18 Iraqi cities between 2005 and 2008. Our paper suggests four empirical regularities associated with price dispersion and market development in postwar Iraq. First, the degree of intracountry price dispersion in Iraq is higher than that reported for a typical industrialized nation. Second, the degree of price dispersion decreased significantly during 2007, coincident with the change in U.S. security strategy known as the surge. Third, the economic impact of the surge is geographically uneven but loosely follows patterns of U.S. deployment-with price dispersion decreasing by roughly one-third in areas targeted during the surge but remaining relatively static in other areas. Finally, we find that internal ethnoreligious divisions have relatively modest effects on price dispersion.","[Blomberg, S.

Our analysis is based on a highly tractable continuous-time overlapping generations model in which the population is divided into three groups (youth dependents, workers, and elderly dependents) and lifecourse transitions take place in a probabilistic fashion. We show that the consumption-maximizing response to greater longevity in highly developed countries is an increase in fertility. However, with larger transfer payments, the actual fertility response will likely be the opposite, leading to further population aging.","[Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Weil, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hock, Heinrich] Mathemat Policy Res, Washington, DC 20024 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Mathematica,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",david_weil@brown.edu,,"Hock, Heinrich/0000-0002-7896-3080","NICHD NIH HHS [R24 HD041020, T32 HD007338] Funding Source: Medline",NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,34,40,44,5,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The new model is constructed by replacing the constant coefficients of firm-specific predictors in the discrete-time hazard model (DHM; see Shumway, 2001; and Chava & Jarrow, 2004) with the smooth functions of macroeconomic variables. Thus, it allows the effects of those firm-specific predictors on the default prediction to change with the macroeconomic dynamics (Pesaran, Schuermann, Treutler, & Weiner, 2006). The coefficient functions in the new model are estimated by a local likelihood approach. One real panel dataset is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. Using an expanding rolling window approach, the empirical results confirm that DVHM has a better and more robust performance than the usual DHM, in the sense that it yields more accurate predicted numbers of defaults and predictive intervals through out-of-sample analysis. Thus, the proposed model is a useful alternative for studying default losses on portfolios. (c) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Landowners make a decision between fixed rent, fixed wage, and sharecropping contracts to hire tenants to operate their land. The choice of tenure contract affects the share of output going to tenants, and within a simple unified growth model, this affects the relative price of food and therefore fertility. Fixed wage contracts elicit the lowest fertility rate and fixed rent contracts the highest, with sharecropping as an intermediate case. The implications of this for long-run growth depend on the assumptions one makes about scale effects in the aggregate economy. With increasing returns to scale, as in several models of innovation, fixed rent contracts imply higher growth through a market size effect. Without such increasing returns, though, fixed rent contracts reduce output per capita through a depressing effect on accumulation.","Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Vollrath, D (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, 201C McElhinney Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",devollrath@uh.edu,,"Vollrath, Dietrich/0000-0003-2532-2009",,,,,36,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Bringing a novel perspective to this debate, we analyze litigant status at the Supreme Court's agenda-setting stage.

The protection of property rights, the enforcement of contracts and an efficient legal system are the pillars of the contemporary rule of law. However, formal institutions cannot function without being internalized by the citizens and without the strong backing of social norms. Morality and social norms are the major elements of the informal institutional structure, the social capital, which is also critical for social welfare and economic development. In this paper we will discuss both the formal and the informal institutional framework of Ancient Athens, which was a free market society with economic problems similar to contemporary market societies. Athenians developed a highly sophisticated legal framework for the protection of private property, the enforcement of contracts and the efficient resolution of disputes. Such an institutional framework functioned effectively, cultivating trust and protecting the security of transactions. This entire system however was based on social norms such as reciprocity, the value of reputation and widely accepted business ethics. Conformity to social norms as well as moral behavior was fostered by social sanction mechanisms (such as stigma) and moral education. The Athenian example is a further proof of the importance of morality and social norms as transaction cost-saving devices even in quite sophisticated legal systems. Their absence or decline leads inevitably to the need for more regulation and litigation and to a growing preference for clear-cut rules instead of discretionary standards. Athenian law was pioneering in the development of rules and institutional mechanisms suitable for the reduction of transaction costs, many of them surviving in the most complex contemporary legal systems.","[Hatzis, Aristides N.] Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Athens, Greece; [Karayiannis, Anastassios D.] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Piraeus,"Hatzis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Athens, Greece.",ahatzis@phs.uoa.gr,"Hatzis, Aristides/AAA-1514-2020",,,,,,126,18,24,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Rapid expansion in the organic foods market led to changes in the regulatory structure, which in turn, made possible the transition of organics from something considered exclusive and value-laden, to something that is conventional and void of many of the original substantive characteristics. Moreover, this process of conventionalization has contributed to a decline in product literacy. Despite a standardized label, consumers generally know less about the products' attributes once conventionalization has occurred. Using the case of organics, we show how the current governance structure for gluten might also be in the process of conventionalization. Yet, this trajectory is not inevitable. Transmutation of the market, which is accomplished via critical analysis and consumers' active engagement in defining gluten-free, may provide an antidote to product dilution and may improve product literacy for those who need or desire gluten-free products most.","[Worosz, Michelle R.; Wilson, Norbert L.

Protective investments are extremely costly and risks are distributed in space and time, which poses important decision problems to the public sector decision makers. In an economic prospective, the evaluation of infrastructure vulnerability is oriented on the estimation of direct and indirect costs of hazards. Although the estimation of direct costs is straightforward, the evaluation of indirect cost involves factors non-directly observable making the approximation a difficult issue. This paper provides an estimate of the indirect costs caused by a two weeks closure of the north-south Gotthard road corridor, one of the most important infrastructure links in Europe, and implements a cost-benefit analysis tool that allows the evaluation of measures ensuring a full protection along the corridor. The identification of the indirect cost relies on the generalized cost estimation, which parameters come from two stated preference experiments, the first based on actual condition whereas the second assumes a road closure. The procedure outlined in this paper proposes a methodology aimed to identify and quantify the economic vulnerability associated with a road transport infrastructure and, to evaluate the economic and social efficiency of a vulnerability reduction by the consideration of protective measures.

This inefficient departure from marginal cost pricing allows gas utilities to cover their fixed infrastructure and operating costs. Proposals for recovering these costs instead through fixed monthly fees are often opposed because of a widespread belief that current rate schedules have desirable distributional consequences. Using nationally representative household-level data, we show that the correlation between household income and natural gas consumption is indeed positive but surprisingly weak, so current rate schedules are only mildly progressive. In part, we argue that this is because poor households tend to have larger families and less energy-efficient homes. We calculate bill impacts under a variety of scenarios and show that even a modest energy assistance program would more than offset the distributional impact of tariff rebalancing for most low-income households.","[Borenstein, Severin; Davis, Lucas W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Borenstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,39,44,48,1,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

This article empirically analyzes this gender gap and explores several explanations. In the United States, the gender gap cannot be explained by differences in education, income, and other socio-demographics or by differences in preferences and job benefits of news consumption. However, the dual burden of paid and household work appears to be one of the drivers of the gender gap. In a cross-country comparison, the gender gap is linked to measures of gender equality in the economy and in politics.","[Benesch, Christine] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ & Appl Econ Res, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Benesch, Christine] Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen; University of St Gallen,"Benesch, C (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ & Appl Econ Res, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",christine.benesch@unisg.ch,,,,,,,31,42,48,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-7764,1532-7736,,J MEDIA ECON,J.

So the desire of people plays a leading role when people make decisions. The insuring process of an applicant is much alike to the process the prospect theory has represented. So the prospect theory is used to count the risk attitude of applicants in this thesis. Based on prospect theory and the results of the status of commercial health insurance in Beijing, transfer the incalculable risk attitude to calculable expect value of different applicants' in the same financial and other situation when facing loss. And then analyze and compare how the gender differences affect the applicants' risk attitude of the commercial health insurance in order to get a conclusion. The search result reflects that: among those who have social insurance male tend to be risk averse but female tend to be risk lover; among those who have no social insurance male tend to be risk lover and female tend to be risk averse.

In addition to its other impacts, FDI changed the operation of developed market economies and integrated them more in the global economy. At a broader level, FDI also influenced undercapitalised transition economies after the fall of the communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe and the transformation process itself. What is more, foreign direct investment influenced transition economies at a national level and in the regions into which it flowed. The first part of the paper considers the theoretical background of FDI and the effects of FDI on a transition economy, especially its effects on the labour market. We consider labour market conditions to be a key in taking decisions on FDI. The second part analyses labour market development in the Liberec region, where the authors are based, and follows its development over the long term. We analyse sectoral and educational structures in the Liberec region and compare these with national figures. The final section focuses on a dependence analysis, applying a statistical method to describe the correlation between FDI and employment in the Czech Republic and in the Liberec region. The aim of this paper is to compare the labour market situation in the Liberec region and that of the national economy in order to demonstrate the specifics of particular regions within the national economy and to analyse the impact of FDI on the regional labour market.","[Demel, Jaroslav; Potuzakova, Zuzana] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Int Trade, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Demel, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Int Trade, Liberec, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.demel@tul.cz; zuzana.potuzakova@tul.cz,"Demel, Jaroslav/HLP-4946-2023","Demel, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6634-2263",,,,,24,8,8,0,11,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

They contribute to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), to the gross fixed capital formation and to the balance of payments. Over time, there have been a number of empirical studies that have shown a positive link between higher levels of the GDP and FDI flows, although this link does not remain valid for all regions. The bidirectional relationship between the foreign direct investment and the economic growth is due, on the one hand, to their impact on the economic environment in each country and on the other hand, to the positive influences which the sustained and sustainable economic growth has on the perceived foreign capital inflows.","[Popa, Lucia Ramona; Vechiu, Camelia; Culita, Gica; Mihailescu, Mariana] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ, Pitesti, Romania",Constantin Brancoveanu University,,lucia_ramona10@yahoo.com; cameliavechiu@yahoo.com; ggculita@yahoo.com; mihailescumariana@yahoo.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,4,"EDITURA UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, ROMANIA",BRASOV,"B DUL IULIU MANIU 41A, BRASOV, 500091, ROMANIA",,,978-606-19-0104-3,,,,2012,,,,,,,110,113,,,,,,4,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BEN34,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000317437100023,0

In this paper, we made a detailed comparative analysis for claim cost assumption which is one of the key assumptions behind the compensation hospitalization insurance by the four population groups (the general hospital population, specific hospital population, social health insurance population and commercial health insurance population). Finally, we use the generalized linear model to do empirical research. It shows that commercial hospitalization insurance premium structure is generally too simple and there is some room for price cuts. We suggest that the commercial health insurance should further optimize the rate structure and properly lower premium to meet more people's meet for health insurance.

From the group of unsupervised learning methods the two step cluster analysis was chosen. This paper analyzes the results obtained using these methods. It aims to create classes of respondents harbouring similar opinions with respect to tuition fees to be paid by foreign students. We have used various tests for the hypotheses such the as Chi-square Test of Independence and the Kruskal-Wallis Test. The research sample consisted of more than one thousand students from six countries. A perfect type of person as candidate was profiled in terms of willingness and the financial means to pursue their studies in the Republic invested and this survey formed the basis of the profiling. Our research shows that an acceptable level of fees depends on several factors such as: the amount of travel involved, family and teachers at the school, then on the assumption that the study stay abroad would improve knowledge of foreign languages, practical work experience offered in the foreign country and the subsequent acquisition of a diploma with Europe-wide validity. There exists an acceptable level of tuition and this in turn reveals that the most acceptable level of tuition fees may be dependent upon the viewpoint of potential practical work experience abroad and then from the viewpoint of improvement in a foreign language. The amount of annual tuition fees that students are willing to pay depends too on the number of university-educated parents the students possess.",,,,marta.zambochova@ujep.cz,,,,,,,11,5,5,0,12,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In the recent past, economic geographers have paid little attention to earlier regional economic analysis and concentrated for the most part on detailed examination of production structures, the chains linking upstream and downstream activities into production and value networks, clusters, institutions and more recently, economic evolution. As a result, existing economic geography is ill-equipped to deal with the impact of some aspects of the evolution of costs, exchange rates, trade and capital flows on regional development and pays relatively little attention to economic calculation. Geographical economics includes an underlying theory of trade and micro-foundations, yet its supply-side approach neglects the role of monetary and demand-side (except in gravity models of trade) factors. The aim of this article is to argue for an extension of existing theoretical frameworks to embrace these issues in the light of recent trends in global economic geography and successive financial and debt crises that have stricken the developed world.","[Dunford, Michael] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England; [Dunford, Michael; Liu, Weidong; Liu, Zhigao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yeung, Godfrey] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117548, Singapore","University of Sussex; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; National University of Singapore","Dunford, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton BN1 9QN, E Sussex, England.",M.F.Dunford@sussex.ac.uk,"SUN, Ye/KBC-8159-2024; Yang, Fei/JLM-3367-2023; Dunford, Michael/J-8306-2019; Yeung, Godfrey/D-3122-2013","Dunford, Michael/0000-0002-0028-3130; Yeung, Godfrey/0000-0002-7027-5005",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020701/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G020701/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,70,11,11,2,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In the former system, the judge makes a decision based on her own acquired information, whereas in the latter system, the advocates are required to present their acquired information to the uninformed judge. Within the binary decision framework, I study the circumstances in which one system is superior to the other in terms of accuracy. The following two effects are notable in the adversarial system: The advocates exert more effort regarding information acquisition than the judge, and the adversarial judge gleans additional information from non-disclosure events. However, one inherent weakness of the adversarial system is its communication problem. In cases in which such a problem is more pronounced, the inquisitorial system should prevail despite its lack of incentives for information collection.

The advantage of this model over existing one-phase models is that it allows for one to obtain not only a unique ranking list of all of the projects but also ranking lists for individual project clusters. The second essential advantage is that the application of this model eliminates the shortcoming of some of the high-ranked projects on the unique ranking list not being high-ranked on the cluster ranking list. Due to the frequency of situations in which projects contain a dualism of interests (e.g., local-global, individual-general, regional-national and national-European), based on the proposed model, a universal model for a two-phase ranking of projects was developed.

In support of motivating, developing, and evaluating such policies, the impacts various transportation infrastructure and use, population density, and policy variables have on passenger travel related carbon dioxide (CO2) the primary GHG - emissions are assessed and resulting policy implications are discussed. A methodology for integrating data from multiple sources in a consistent manner is developed and implemented, producing a rich dataset consisting of 146 of the largest urbanized areas in the US. The magnitudes of the impacts that changes in certain variables have on CO2 emissions in select urbanized areas are quantified. The results indicate that the variable used as a proxy for the presence of policies aimed at addressing environmental concerns and travelers' attitudes and behaviors towards such concerns influences the impacts changes in transportation characteristics and population density have on CO2 emissions. Depending on these effects, the impacts of changes in average private vehicle occupancy and freeway lane-miles per capita are found to be the largest. In addition, changes in average travel time have a substantial impact on CO2 emissions. While the explanatory effect of transit share is found to be statistically significant, the magnitudes of the impacts of changes in this variable are less appreciable in comparison to those of the above variables, which is understandable in light of the fairly low values of transit share and transit service utilization across most US urbanized areas. Furthermore, the impacts of changes in population density are the smallest among all the variables that are found to have statistically significant explanatory effects. However, this finding does not undermine the role land-use policies could play as increased density could have a direct or an indirect effect on reduced travel times and increased transit use, which in turn contribute to reduced CO2 emissions. In addition to quantifying the impacts, several policy implications stemming from the findings are identified and discussed. Notably, the relative magnitudes of the impacts corresponding to the different variables are found to vary appreciably across urbanized areas, implying that policies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions should focus on different sets of variables depending on the overall characteristics of the specific urbanized area and any existing policies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions.

Starr",,,The trade-offs between population density and households' transportation-housing costs,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Density; Housing costs; Smart growth; Transit,AREAS,"As metropolitan area governments and others promote density-promoting smart growth policies, finer analysis is needed to quantify the impact of such policies on households transportation and housing costs. Existing research suggests that households in urban areas trade-off between housing costs and transportation costs, but does not explore how policies to increase urban densities might explicitly impact this balance. Furthermore, the research does not adequately distinguish between the effect of urban area density and the effects of other factors associated with urban area density (e.g metropolitan area size and household incomes) on housing costs. This paper uses the 2000 Census Public Use Micro Sample (PUMS) person and household data from 23 of the nation's most densely populated states to identify the impact of increased population density on three housing cost measures: household rents, housing unit values, and monthly mortgage payments. Log linear models were estimated for each housing cost measure using least-squares regression. Dependent variables included household, housing unit, and geographic area characteristics, including population density. The models were found to be very similar to one another in terms of the statistical significance and values of estimated model parameters. Population density (measured at the PUMS area level) was found to be statistically significant at the 0.01 level for all housing cost measures. Although significant, the parameter estimates show that the elasticity of housing cost with respect to population density is low, ranging from 0.041 to 0.05. This research also explores the relationship between housing costs and accessibility. Results show that households living in areas closer to jobs (as indicated by shorter average commute times) and households utilizing fixed route transit systems have marginally higher housing costs.

This study surveyed a sample of 610 older people in Taipei City. The respondents rated the degree of importance of 18 indicators, and their degree of satisfaction with 35 items, which were derived from these 18 indicators relating to age-friendly transportation. Rough Sets Theory (RST) and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) were used as qualitative and quantitative data mining approaches. Useful and simple decision rules regarding the perspective of age-friendly transportation can be obtained using RST. These decision rules involve policy implications. The application of IPA further facilitated the focuses of improvement strategies. Subsequently, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to evaluate improvement strategies. The results showed that the focuses and the priority ranking of the strategy scenarios were (1) training for bus drivers; (2) enhancing the universal design of transport stops and stations; (3) enhancing the quality of transit information and providing more pedestrian scrambles; (4) education for drivers and enforcement of driving rules; and (5) providing more age-friendly vehicles. Two out of five strategy scenarios are related to driver behavior. We strongly recommend that the future policy focus be on requiring people to be competent and courteous drivers.

We offer a solution that permits an empirical test of this relationship while accounting for reverse causality and potential omitted variable bias. Our approach is illustrated by evaluating the causal impact of family size on infant mortality using genealogical data from 13 German parishes spanning the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.

However, these inspections incur various costs, including imposing delays on legitimate traffic and increasing expenditures to operate the crossings. In this study, we quantify the economic impacts of delays related to movement of passenger and commercial vehicles across 17 major land border crossings and international air travelers at 4 major US airports. We estimate the value of time spent in these delays, and how this changes if one inspection officer is added to each crossing's staff. We quantify how the transportation cost for shipping goods by truck into the US changes if wait time falls, and use the GTAP CGE model to estimate the change in macroeconomic activity in the US, Canada, and Mexico caused by the decrease in transportation cost. We also determine how many new cross-border passenger-vehicle trips result from a fall in wait time, and quantify the increase in economic activity in the US and its border regions associated with these new trips. Our results indicate that changes in US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) staffing would have significantly positive impacts on US GDP, trade balances, and employment, and would also significantly reduce the opportunity cost of waiting by passengers and truck drivers.

Building on recent theoretical research, we construct a model of the leasing decision in which leasing mitigates adverse selection and reduces transaction costs, but moral hazard limits its use. In our model, the prevalence of leasing is related to new-car reliability, which suggests that the recent growth in leasing is at least partly due to improvements in new-car reliability. We use this model to derive testable implications and then conduct an empirical analysis to investigate whether the operation of the new- and used-car markets is consistent with the predictions of this theoretical approach. Our empirical results support the theoretical predictions of our model. In particular, we provide direct evidence that leasing mitigates adverse selection and that an important factor in the growth in new-car leasing rates has indeed been the growth of new-car reliability.","[Johnson, Justin P.; Schneider, Henry S.; Waldman, Michael] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Johnson, JP (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Waldman, Michael/AAC-8242-2019","Schneider, Henry/0000-0002-4050-687X",,,,,44,6,7,1,28,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The model, which is built in the New Keynesian tradition, contains real and nominal rigidities such as habit formation in consumption, price and wage stickiness as well as rich stochastic structure. The framework also incorporates the theory of unemployment, small open economy aspects and a nominal interest rate that is set exogenously by the area-wide monetary authority. As an illustration, the model is estimated on Luxembourgish data. We evaluate the properties of the estimated model and assess its forecasting performance relative to reduced-form model such as vector autoregression (VAR).

These models typically have many factors of different character, such as operational, design-based, technological, and economics-based. Such factors generally contain uncertainty, which leads to uncertainty in model outputs. For such models, it is critical to both the application of model results and the future development of the model that a formal approach to the assessment of uncertainty in the model be established and carried out. In this paper, a comprehensive approach to the uncertainty assessment of complex models intended to support decision-making and policy-making processes is presented. The approach consists of seven steps, which are establishing assessment goals, documenting assumptions and limitations, documenting model factors and outputs, classifying and characterizing factor uncertainty, conducting uncertainty analysis, conducting sensitivity analysis, and presenting results. Highlights of the approach are demonstrated on a real-world model intended to estimate the impacts of aviation on climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While there is evidence for a negative correlation between income inequality and a population's average life expectancy, it is not clear whether this is due to an aggregation effect based on a non-linear relationship between income and life expectancy or to income inequality being a health hazard in itself. The proposed correction method is general and independent of measures of income inequality, functional form assumptions of the health production function, and assumptions on the income distribution. We apply it to data from the Human Development Report and find that the relationship between income inequality and life expectancy can be explained entirely by the aggregation effect. Hence, there is no evidence that income inequality itself is a health hazard.","[Mayrhofer, Thomas; Schmitz, Hendrik] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Mayrhofer, Thomas; Schmitz, Hendrik] Hlth Econ Res Ctr, D-45127 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Mayrhofer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Schuetzenbahn 70, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",thomas.mayrhofer@uni-due.de,,"Schmitz, Hendrik/0000-0002-0253-102X; Mayrhofer, Thomas/0000-0001-6287-5185",,,,,27,8,9,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This involves searching out advanced producer service (APS) firms that constitute strategic networks, from whose activities strategic places can be defined. Twenty-five out of 175 APS firms are found to be strategic, and from their office networks, 45 cities out of 526 are designated as strategic places. A measure of strategicness of cities is devised, and individual findings from this are discussed by drawing on existing literature about how APS firms use specific cities. A key finding shows that New York and London have different levels of strategicness, and this is related to the former's innovation prowess and the latter's role in global consumption of services. Other cases of strategicness discussed in terms of the balance between production and consumption of APSs are Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; Palo Alto; Mexico City; Johannesburg; and Dubai and Frankfurt.","[Taylor, Peter J.] Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8SP, Tyne & Wear, England; [Derudder, Ben] Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Faulconbridge, James] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Org Work & Technol, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Hoyler, Michael] Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Ni, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Monash University; Lancaster University; Loughborough University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Taylor, PJ (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8SP, Tyne & Wear, England.",crogfam@yahoo.com; ben.derudder@ugent.be; j.faulconbridge@lancaster.ac.uk; m.hoyler@lboro.ac.uk; Ni_pengfei@163.com,"Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020; Hoyler, Michael/H-3731-2014; Faulconbridge, James/JZE-5154-2024; Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008; Liu, Qian/AAG-8996-2021","Liu, Qian/0000-0002-0756-4891; Faulconbridge, James/0000-0003-1809-4271; Hoyler, Michael/0000-0003-2683-6175; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544",,,,,56,122,145,5,185,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

To that end, it examines the apparent success of New Zealand's designer fashion industry in the first years of the twenty-first century. The paper critiques the conclusion that New Zealand's fashion success was the outcome of national industry policies that nurtured and promoted place-based creative talent. It also critiques the micro-scale, network-based research methodologies that produce such a conclusion. The paper deploys novel quantitative methods to show how retail market structures and trade regulations shaped competition in the isolated and newly integrated Australasian fashion market. New Zealand's creative success is shown to have relied on advantageous cost relativities and favourable macro institutional arrangements. The paper concludes that convincing explanations of creative industry success must consider the effects of higher order processes and structures that are not revealed by micro-scale, actor-based methodologies.","Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Weller, SA (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",sally.weller@monash.edu,"Weller, Sally/AAG-8467-2020","Weller, Sally/0000-0002-2791-5687",,,,,65,10,10,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Based on the usage levels of the target costing systems and information technology infrastructure, four forms of KM strategies were proposed: explorative, exploitative, mixed, and negative. Using cluster analysis, we empirically showed four types of KM strategies and three kinds of business strategies (i.e. differentiation, low-cost, and composite business strategies). From the results of this study, it was found that when a low-cost strategy is aligned with the explorative strategy, knowledge creation is relatively more activated, and the degrees of process innovations are more enhanced. The empirical results also showed that if the alignment of a differentiation strategy with an exploitative strategy is achieved, the levels of knowledge transfer or sharing and storage, and the degrees of product innovations increase more. In the case of the alignment of the composite business strategy with the mixed strategy, it was observed that with tight alignment, the levels of KM activities as well as the degrees of process and product innovations are more enhanced.","Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business, Taegu 702701, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Choe, JM (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Business, Sankyuk Dong 1370, Taegu 702701, South Korea.",choejj@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,30,9,9,1,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The easier divorce culture is defined as the introduction of no-fault including unilateral divorce reforms across the US. According to the results, the divorce revolution seems to have had some effect on trust levels across the US. While there are no discernible effects for the whole sample of men, there are statistically significant effects for women with an additional year of exposure being associated with a 4 percentage point lower generalized trust in the states with easy divorce culture compared to states with fault based divorce culture. An analysis by subgroup of women indicates that married and divorced/separated women have significantly lower levels of trust associated with exposure to easy divorce culture as a child. The findings are in agreement with the predictions of previous literature regarding no-fault divorce reforms reducing the security offered by marriage, in particular for women. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

By explicitly determining the allocation of prosecutorial resources endogenously from partisan and administrative considerations, we show that this specification leads to larger estimates of the effect of resources on convictions. We also control for and confirm in a panel context the effects of many previously identified correlates and causes of corruption. We find more limited, recent evidence for the deterrent effect of increased prosecutions.

The study area is the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) metropolitan region, which also has several initiatives to build/expand different competitive economic clusters export-oriented, interconnected firms in the region. We analyze current transit accessibility to the existing clusters in the region and find significant sector to sector differences that highlight both the poor level of transit access to some economic sectors and the need of automobile ownership to be able to reliably access these jobs. Further, given changes that are being made to the transit system, we conduct scenario analyses and ask which population and employment growth patterns the region should follow to maximize transit accessibility for its residents. The results suggest that a strategy which focuses growth along transitways, particularly the growth of jobs along transitway corridors, will achieve the best regional transit accessibility gains. The research helps to bridge the separate bodies of literature on competitive clusters and transit, tests alternative land use scenarios to enhance accessibility, and investigates the importance of transit for jobs in regional competitive clusters.

By interviewing predominantly Dutch, non-gentrifying customers in the rapidly gentrifying Indische Buurt neighbourhood in Amsterdam, we uncovered discourses which are both welcoming to, and cautious of the process. Three themes were examined: changes in the neighbourhood, changes in the role of pubs in daily life and changes in the interactions within pubs. In many respects, the process of gentrification is welcomed because it represents something 'Dutch' coming into the neighbourhood after years of immigration. Divisions between gentrifiers and non-gentrifiers are not experienced as starkly as is often portrayed in the literature; our respondents tended to be much more ambivalent than other non-gentrifying groups portrayed in studies elsewhere. This may be due to the more managed-nature of Dutch gentrification. However, there is a sense that one's pub is impervious to the changes in the rest of the neighbourhood, a discourse which must be taken into account when drawing any long-term conclusions from this study.","[Ernst, Olaf] NHTV Breda Univ Appl Sci, Acad Leisure, Breda, Netherlands; [Doucet, Brian] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Breda University of Applied Sciences; Utrecht University,"Doucet, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, POB 80115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",ernst.o@nhtv.nl; b.m.doucet@uu.nl,,,,,,,50,31,37,5,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Nevertheless, most of the work on cluster development has asserted benefits that accrue to a regional economy as a whole, with little or no focus on specific links between clusters and poverty alleviation. This article seeks to understand the degree to which economic clusters are associated with lower poverty rates. Specifically, using spatial regression analysis techniques, we examine patterns that link clusters to poverty rates while controlling for the presence of other factors that shape the distribution of poverty in the United States. When controlling for other economic and demographic factors in a multivariate framework, the presence of industrial clusters is associated with lower poverty rates. Moreover, regions with a higher share of employment in clusters, and with that employment dispersed across many industries within the same cluster, fare even better than those where employment is concentrated in a single industry. Furthermore, while there is evidence that particular clusters are associated with significantly altered poverty rates, not all of these associations are beneficial.","[Fowler, Christopher S.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kleit, Rachel Garshick] Ohio State Univ, Knowlton Sch Architecture, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Fowler, CS (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, 302 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",csfowler@psu.edu; kleit.1@osu.edu,"Kleit, Rachel Garshick/G-6559-2012; Fowler, Christopher S/H-3017-2012","Fowler, Christopher/0000-0001-8415-0441",,,,,79,20,27,0,98,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

His account of some commitments as goal-displacing gives rise to a dilemma given the standard philosophical theory of agency. Either commitment-motivated actions are externally motivated, in which case they are not expressions of agency, or such actions are internally motivated, in which case the commitment is not goal-displacing. I resolve this dilemma and accommodate his view of commitment as motivation by developing a broader descriptive theory of agency, which recognizes both agent goal-directed and goal-displacing commitments. I propose a type of goal-displacing commitment, which I call 'tacit commitment', that can be seen to fit between the horns. Tacit commitments regulate behaviour without being made conscious and explicit.

However the literature dealing with school travel is limited. Hence, a study of school-travel patterns can generate many important insights that may impact transport-system policy and management. This paper focuses on school-commuting patterns and related perceptions of schoolchildren's parents among the Jewish and Arab populations of Israel. The study aims at understanding the commuting behavior of these children, ages 9-15. It examines the relationship between gender and socio-economic characteristics in the commuting behavior of Jewish and Arab schoolchildren. The basic hypothesis is that there are differences in school commuting patterns because of various differences between these two groups. The study is based on a questionnaire administered to 1755 students from various cities and villages in Israel and their parents. Descriptive statistic and multinomial logit model were used to study the differences in travel behavior within two population groups. The results show differences in school-travel patterns between Jewish and Arab schoolchildren. Age, gender, car availability, and parents work status were found to impact their travel behavior, including walking time to school. The differences appear in morning commuting behavior, commuting mode used by boys and by girls, and their preferred mode. For both population groups, the older the child and the fewer private automobiles in the household, the more likely it is that they will walk to school as opposed to being driven by car. Arab children with employed mothers were more likely to be driven to school than to commute by school bus or on foot, whereas no significant impact was found among the Jewish children having working mothers. In addition, the results indicated also that there are differences in parental behavioral patterns and perceptions concerning their children's mode of arriving to school, aspects that should be taken into account when dealing with planning policies which aim to increase children walking. The results of the study provide insights into policies and campaigns that may help to promote walking and bicycling and generate the development of healthier and greener travel behaviour.

By creating the foreseeable possibility (not certainty) of a shortage, a prohibition on price gouging may cause rational consumers to increase consumption. This has particularly interesting implications for markets with external benefits - expectations about policy-induced shortages may increase socially beneficial preparedness for times of acute scarcity (e.g., obtaining vaccinations prior to epidemics, keeping goods on hand in preparation for natural disasters). Thus, under some conditions, laws against price gouging may increase total surplus. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Recent theoretical literature shows that central regions with large clusters of economic activity are able to set positive tax rates without fear of losing firms to peripheral regions as the firms would forego 'rents' from agglomeration economies. We study whether local policy makers effectively tax such agglomeration rents. We test this with data from Swiss municipalities. We find that municipalities in large urban areas indeed set higher tax rates than those in small ones. Within urban areas, however, municipal tax rates are unrelated to the size of economic activity in and around municipalities while they are positively related to the size of the political jurisdiction.

We also find that higher education level (human capital) and family involvement (social capital) are likely to bring better business performance.","[Atmadja, Adwin Surja; Su, Jen-Je; Sharma, Parmendra] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,,adwin.atmadja@griffithuni.edu.au; j.su@griffith.edu.au; p.sharma@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,123,2,2,0,19,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-7-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,101,123,,,,,,23,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB2XI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342457200008,0

We also comprise the information contained in components of GDP and obtain short-term GDP projections from disaggregated perspective. We run out-of-sample forecasting procedures to evaluate GDP projections and to assess forecasting accuracy of all individual statistical models. We conclude that factor and bridge models are among the best individually performing models in the suite. Forecasting accuracy obtained using disaggregated models of factor and bridge models is noteworthy and might be considered as a good alternative to aggregated ones. Furthermore, weighted combination of the forecasts of the statistical models allows obtaining robust and accurate forecasts which leads to a reduction of forecasted errors. (c) 2014 The Authors.

More importantly, much of the reported research has focused on managerial mechanisms under the direct control of service managers. This study shows that by viewing their responsibilities more broadly than only their narrow service-related goals, service managers can do much to prevent disgruntled clients from switching to competing service providers. A thousand clients of a commercial bank who complained about a service failure completed an online questionnaire. Following a thorough assessment of the construct validity of the measurement model, the mediating role of brand superiority and corporate reputation was assessed by means of structural equation modeling. The results reveal that both brand superiority and reputation mediate the relationship between negative word-of-mouth and intentions to switch to a competing service provider, following a service failure. The results show that by enhancing the firm's brand superiority and corporate reputation, service firms can build a 'buffer' that can deter clients who have suffered a service failure from switching to a competing service provider. In other words, service managers should broaden their organisational involvement by participating in activities such as strategic planning, corporate reputation management, and the planning of brand strategies and positioning strategies, as these variables can prevent complaining clients from ending their relationship with the offending service provider. The results, by implication, caution service managers against a myopic view of their role in the service organisation.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Boshoff, C (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Business Management, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",,,"Boshoff, Christo/0000-0002-8340-2034",,,,,57,1,1,0,17,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The national level of innovation is measured by expenditure on R&D as an input/catalyst of the whole innovation process. Finally, analytical findings are reported with the accompanying discussion.

Although held to be untrue for European cities at the time, some such growth did emerge in London a decade later than first reported for New York. The question is whether there was simply a delay before London conformed to the global city model or whether another distinct cause was at work in both cases. This article proposes that the critical factor in both cases was actually an upsurge of immigration from poor countries that provided an elastic supply of cheap labor. This hypothesis and its counterpart based on the growth in elite jobs are tested econometrically for the British case with regional data spanning 1975-2008, finding some support for both effects, but with immigration from poor countries as the crucial influence in late 1990s London.","[Gordon, Ian Richard] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Gordon, Ian Richard; Kaplanis, Ioannis] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kaplanis, Ioannis] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Tarragona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Gordon, IR (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",I.R.Gordon@lse.ac.uk; I.Kaplanis@lse.ac.uk,"Gordon, Ian R/B-8892-2008","Gordon, Ian Richard/0000-0002-2170-8193","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1, ES/G005966/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,6,6,1,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Furthermore, the study proposes that both a structural and relational/experiential dimension of closeness, enables micro-entrepreneurs to create meaning and knowledge collaboratively with other entrepreneurs and actors.

The study is based on in-depth interviews with 150 households of Forest Protection Committees (FPC) in Paschim Medinipur district in the West Bengal state of India. Based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of 14 participatory indicators, it follows that social aspects of participation are considerably less important in West Bengal than as found elsewhere in India, while the perception of the environment (first and third factor) stand out as the most important aspects of participation in JFM, jointly explaining almost half of the variance. Regression analyses indicate that household size, the number of forest committee meetings, religion of the household, willingness to pay of the household for the forest protection and the size of land holding are important variables for explaining variation in levels of participation. Results from estimating game theoretic models on participation among villagers in JFM indicates that in two out of the four possible situations, harmonious sharing of the benefits is an (Nash) equilibrium, but not unique. In all cases, institutional checks and balances are needed to guarantee mutual participation, which is possible only by strengthening the JFM management body.

Market orientation is based on marketing conception and is described by many researchers as a method that helps to contribute to the better management of a company. The perception of the implementation of market orientation is evolving. However, the main principle is still the same - market orientation has a positive impact on business performance. Nowadays, a lot of authors deal with the implementation of market orientation. From this reason, we have undertaken research entitled: Research on implementation on market orientation in Hi-Tech Firms (GA 402/07/1493). The paper deals with market orientation and strategic behavior at hi-tech firms. The objective of the paper is to assess relationships between market orientation and strategic behaviour at high-tech companies. The data was acquired via a New Method questionnaire, which measured market orientation in a company. The New Method questionnaire, containing a 7-point Likert scale created by Tomaskova [54] was used for the research. The complete database was analyzed by using standard statistical methods (correlation analysis, Spearman correlation coefficient, chi-square) as well as other sophisticated techniques (Cronbach alpha). The main results of the research show that the level of market orientation at hi-tech firms in the Czech Republic is high and confirms the importance of obtaining information and using this information inside the company for market orientation. The main results of the research findings show that market orientation has a significant influence on strategic behaviour. It is possible to say that strategic behaviour is a part of market orientation. This strategic behaviour can be divided into two parts: Firstly gaining information for strategic company decision-making and, secondly, ways of using the information obtained in a company. Both these parts have a significant influence on business performance.","[Kanovska, Lucie] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic; [Tomaskova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Fac Law, Dept Financial Law & Econ, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno,"Kanovská, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",kanovska@fbm.vutbr.cz; eva.tomaskova@law.muni.cz,"Kanovska, Lucie/AGA-2051-2022; Tomaskova, Eva/D-3973-2014","Tomaskova, Eva/0000-0002-0579-4976; Kanovska, Lucie/0000-0003-2797-7973",,,,,63,7,8,2,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Based only on financial data, five failure processes are detected for Finnish and six for Estonian firms. Established failure processes associate with different failure reasons. The study contributes to literature by showing that for similar companies failure processes can differ across countries.

Most medium and large scale organisations spend large amounts of money and reserves on HR software, but unfortunately many of them utilise it only for HR administrative purposes rather than for effective and efficient human resource planning (true HRP). This study aims to explore the extent of usage of a Human Resource Information System (HRIS) in mid to large sized organizations and the advantages they derive from the implementation of the same in the Human Resource Planning (HRP) sub-functions. HRIS outline the integration between Human Resource Management (FIRM) and Information Technology (Gerardine deSanctis, 1986). Primary data was collected by means of questionnaires from 50 senior and junior HR executives/managers in three organizations in Pune. It was found that the greatest uses of HRIS were its contribution to the efficiency and effectiveness of HR planning through HRIS skills' inventory, HRIS training needs analysis, HRIS succession planning and HRIS labour demand and supply analysis. Results showed that identification of unfilled job positions accurately is the most frequently accepted HRIS feature. Organisations can record good BR planning efficiency and effectiveness if HRIS aligns with information system strategy and BR strategy. Organisations need to integrate HRIS functions with other business functions. The study revealed that HRIS needs to offer more intelligent capabilities to increase the effectiveness of BR planning.

The Czech Republic is one of twenty EU Member States that have implemented a statutory minimum wage. Since its introduction in 1991, the gross minimum wage was increased sixteen times by the government. In addition to increases in the gross minimum wage, the purchasing power of the minimum wage is affected by the development of price levels and also by changes in tax and social security and health insurance. In the Czech Republic three periods in the development of the minimum wage can be distinguished. In the first years after its introduction, the gross minimum wage did not increase significantly and its real value declined. The period 1999-2006 is a period of rapid growth in both the nominal and the real minimum wage. In the period 2007-2012, the nominal wage was constant and its real value gradually decreased. These three phases correspond to the political orientation of Czech governments. Leftist governments raised minimum wages faster than right-wing governments. The article also provides an analysis of the motivational function of the minimum wage. It compares the net minimum wage with the living minimum. It appears that the motivational function of the minimum wage has been reducing in recent years. This is true especially for persons with dependent children. The last part of the article includes an analysis of the relationship between the increase in the minimum wage and the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic. In addition to total unemployment, the impact of the minimum wage on unemployment of young people and people with low levels of education is analyzed. It shows that there is no clear relationship between the minimum wage and the unemployment rates in the Czech Republic.","[Pavelka, Tomas] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague, Czech Republic; [Skala, Marek] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec, Czech Republic; [Cadil, Jan] Univ Econ, BIRC, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Technical University Liberec; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavelka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague, Czech Republic.",pavelkat@vse.cz; marek.skala@tul.cz; jcadil@bivs.cz,,"Cadil, Jan/0000-0001-7043-796X",,,,,20,22,22,4,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Results based on the dynamic panel model estimates confirm the presence of the competition effect of inward FDI, as well as show that the effects of foreign firms' entry and activity on domestic firms' performance and the nature of the induced competitive process depend strongly on the initial industry market structure. No evidence of the horizontal productivity spillover effects is found. Results, however, suggest that geographical proximity plays an important role in the ability of local firms to benefit from foreign firms presence and show that the inter-industry productivity spillover effects are most pronounced in the medium-concentrated industries.","[Ponikvar, Nina; Kejzar, Katja Zajc] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Ponikvar, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",nina.ponikvar@ef.uni-lj.si; katja.zajc@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Ponikvar, Nina/0000-0003-3976-211X",,,,,40,2,2,0,12,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The results indicate that companies within clusters easily access government supports, attach importance to learning effects, demonstrate greater capabilities to absorb skills and know-how spilled over from foreign investment companies, and experience less impact due to crowd-out effects caused by foreign capital. Endogenous creation within clusters with little contribution to performance implies that superiority of resource agglomeration and learning networks have not converted into creative superiority. Companies outside clusters place greater emphasis on exogenous innovation driven by foreign capitals than do companies within clusters. We propose that, lacking capital and technical stock, governors should pay more attention to exogenous creative sources, accelerate the industrialization process of creative achievements through training and technical exchange and establish technical service platforms.","[Qu, Tao] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Res Natl Econ, Dept Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Shan-Min] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Hang] China Construct Forth Engn Div Corp, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiao-Hui] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; Sun Yat Sen University; Guangdong University of Finance & Economics,"Qu, T (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Res Natl Econ, Dept Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",qutaokathy@163.com; mnslsm@mail.sysu.edu.cn; xianghang33@163.com; 513025660@qq.com,,,"National Social Science Funding Committee; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Science Funding Committee [14BGL015, 11JZD020, 2012YB10]","National Social Science Funding Committee; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China); Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Science Funding Committee","Tao Qu, San-min Li, Hang Xiang and Xiao-hui Wu are grateful to the National Social Science Funding Committee, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China and Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Science Funding Committee for financial support under Project 14BGL015, 11JZD020 and 2012YB10.",,16,0,0,0,3,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-7-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,124,142,,,,,,19,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB2XI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342457200009,0

However, with changing economic, social and demographic scenario, the situation has undergone a change. Substantial research has found that children have influence in family purchase decisions. McNeal (1987) categorized children as three markets in one: they are current market that spends money on their desires, they are a future market for most goods and services and they are markets of influential that cause billions of dollars of purchase among their parents. A study by Nickelodeon (2013) states that power of kids influence over purchasing decisions has increased significantly over the years and decision making among families is collaborative. McNeal (1998) reported that children's indirect purchase through influencing parents decisions soared from USD 5 billion in 1960s to USD 188 billion in 1997. Today children are not passive users but influential buyers and are socialized in this role from an early age. The topic gains special relevance from Indian context due to various reasons. The influence of children in decision making is still an unexplored topic in India. The study specially gains relevance as India has witnessed huge cultural, social and economic changes in the past decade. With compounded annual growth rate of 5.36% predicted for average household disposable income between 2005-2025 (McKinsey Global Institute, 2007) the financial position of families is much stronger. As per Census 2010 of India, demographically India is a young nation with 30% of the population below the age group of 15 years. According to consumer socialization theory family, peers, media are important socialization agents. Also according to research, child's influence is effected by product category, age of child, family communication pattern (Ahuja and Stinson, 1993, Caruana and Vassallo, 2003, Haynes et al, 1993; Ozgen, 2003). The model integrates these two different areas of research to develop a conceptual model to explore the relation of influence of children with respect to different factors. The model introduces the concept of parent's re-socialization. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Competition keeps growing on the current market, and small or medium companies have increasingly more difficult position in establishing themselves against the international chains. If such companies wish to succeed in this struggle, they must utilize all means leading to creation of long-term relationships with their customers. Social media represent one way of building such relationship, since it is activity, creativity, idea, or thought, and not financial means, what matters. However, there is still a question regarding how companies should utilize social media so that they satisfy individual wishes and needs of customers and stay on the market. Proposal of a certain communication method standard that would provide small and middle companies with a general instructions how to build a relationship with a customer can be the solution. Therefore, this study's objective rests in a proposal of a marketing communication model that respect specifics of small or medium companies and social media. The communication model was built especially on identification of dimensions that are the most important in a user's perception of the social medium. At first, this study summarizes existing knowledge on utilization of the social media, communication modeling, and the current relationship of a sender and a recipient toward social communication. These concepts were subjected to the comparative analysis and summarized in the final synthesis. For the purpose of achieving the study's objective, empirical evaluation of social media users had been carried out. Data was evaluated using one-dimension and multiple-dimension statistic analysis.

A positive flat toll, for maximising the highway owner's profit, leads to shortening and extension of the departure time intervals using auto and transit modes, respectively.","[Huang, Hai-Jun] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wen-Xiang] North China Univ Technol, Beijing Key Lab Urban Intelligent Traff Control T, Beijing 100041, Peoples R China",Beihang University; North China University of Technology,"Huang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",haijunhuang@buaa.edu.cn,"Huang, Hai-Jun/AAP-2269-2020","Huang, Hai-Jun/0000-0002-9001-9172",,,,,35,28,30,1,16,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

Existing rules have not resulted in economically unreasonably cumulative royalty levels, nor in holdup that has identifiably impeded the uptake of any new technology. The article offers hypotheses about the causes of this disconnect between theory and the real world, and cautions that inadequately considered changes imposed on SEP licensing systems may have unintended harmful results. Existing SSO patent licensing rules are the result of truly ex ante negotiations among industry participants of differing interests that must cooperate to create new value. A diverse sequence of investments is necessary for the creation of a commercially successful standard; the effect of any proposed change to SEP licensing rules on each class of necessary investor must be carefully considered. Rather than promising assured returns for all participants, standardization changes the nature and allocation of risk, potentially increasing the risk facing pre-standardization investors while decreasing the risks facing post-standardization investors. Even the mechanisms available to resolve disputes concerning SEP licensing can have substantive impact; the introduction of the possibility of antitrust remedies for violations of what began as contractual FRAND undertakings strongly changes bargaining power in license negotiations, and hence reduces incentives to invest in basic RD. In studying all these issues, models built around the development and licensing of a single invention may have little relevance to industries characterized by portfolio licensing.",,,,rgbrooks@cravath.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The results show that Cambodian clothing firms show a strong participation in innovation; in addition, the relationship between exports and innovation intensity is strong and positive.

We argue that shifts in the Senate's or President's preferences (e.g., a new majority party in the Senate; a new president) reshape House members' expectations about which legislative outcomes are achievable. Reshaped expectations, in turn, can alter House members' perceptions of the consequences of reallocating power among themselves. We prove that such reshaped expectations can induce House members to change power-sharing rules. To evaluate this claim, we examine major rule changes from 1879 to 2009. We find that the House was far more likely to change rules after elections that shifted partisan control of the Senate or Presidency than after elections in which no such shift occurred. Since the existing literature does not anticipate this finding, this work clarifies an important attribute of how power is distributed within the House.

This paper studies product and process innovation and investment in technologies and management practices as industry upgrading. Firm-level evidence from Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam suggests that there are not significant differences in innovation and investment between firms with foreign affiliates and firms without foreign affiliates, but there are sizable differences in organizational changes across locations of foreign affiliates. Firms' self-reported buyer and supplier data also suggest spillover effects between downstream and upstream firms within a single global or local production chain. We establish five facts about intra-firm management practices and inter-firm relationships in production networks within southeast Asia as follows: (1) Firms are more likely to extend the geographic scope of their foreign platforms if they run both exporting and importing; (2) firm size and R&D sales ration play a role of foreign platforms in ASEAN, Europe, and the USA, but these have no effects on foreign platforms in east Asia; (3) emerging multinationals do not achieve product development if they have foreign platforms in east Asia while they achieve product development if they establish foreign platforms in Europe and the USA and (4) the type of organizational process improvements vary with locations of foreign platforms, i.e. foreign platforms in Europe and the USA can deliver knowledge about higher quality products instead of prohibiting new intermediate inputs; (5) emerging multinationals are more likely to share information with supplier for quality control within a production chain if they have foreign affiliates in Japan. These facts first serve as a basis of the intra- and inter-firm managerial practices of a global production chain in emerging markets.","[Ishida, Masami] Japan External Trade Org, Bangkok Res Ctr, Inst Developing Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Machikita, Tomohiro] Asia Res Ctr, Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Econ & Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Machikita, Tomohiro] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ueki, Yasushi] Japan External Trade Org IDE JETRO, Interdisciplinary Studies Ctr, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan",Copenhagen Business School; Stanford University,,tomohiro_machikita@ide.go.jp,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023","Ueki, Yasushi/0000-0002-2893-8864","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730233, 25380559, 22330087] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,36,3,3,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Accordingly, pension funds worldwide devise laws that preserve and improve these key objectives. Laws that failed to take into account these objectives not only impose extra financial burden on the pension system, but also may pose undesirable social and economic effects. In this respect, economic analysis of pension laws would help lawmakers to make workable and implementable laws. Generally, economic analysis of law seeks to answer two basic questions regarding legal rules: what are the effects of legal rules on the behavior of relevant actors? And are these effects socially desirable? This paper examines the pension law of Iran's civil servant pension fund (CSPF) for female heirs in light of the afore-mentioned key objectives of pension system, and from social justice point of view. The results from the analysis reveal that this does not only adhere to social justice and pension system's main purpose, but also it imposes economic and social costs. The weak side of the law also creates financial burden on the pension fund, the young generation (paying pension benefits to the considered heirs from its contribution) and the public at large. The study also shows that life time payment of pensions to heirs by CSPF encourages late or informal marriages hence defecting acceptable social norms and may increase informal labor supply, creating a further problem in the labor market. The study thus recommends the need for reforming the existing law and rules of CSPF for female heirs.","Univ Siena, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Ghasemi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",ghasemi@unisi.it,"Ghasemi, Mojtaba/R-1877-2019",,,,,,3,0,0,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

However, most tend to focus on industrialized countries, just one mode of globalization of innovation and often one traditional indicator of innovation, such as patents or R&D investment, thus ignoring the complexity and multiple aspects of the phenomenon. This paper explores empirically the linkages between different modes of globalization of innovation and firms' micro-characteristics in two of the fastest growing emerging economies. We analyze three distinct modes of globalization of innovation: the global exploitation of innovation, the global sourcing of technology and global research collaboration. We then use primary data from Chinese and Indian firms belonging to three sectors (automotive components, software and green biotech) to explore the differences in the ways in which the firms located in these two economies globalize their innovatiton activities.","[Plechero, Monica] CNR, Inst Res Populat & Social Policies, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Chaminade, Cristina] Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Lund, Sweden",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Lund University,"Plechero, M (通讯作者)，CNR, Inst Res Populat & Social Policies, Via Palestro 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",m.plechero@irpps.cnr.it,"Chaminade, Cristina/JDD-3357-2023; Plechero, Monica/AFO-7951-2022","Chaminade, Cristina/0000-0002-6739-8071; Plechero, Monica/0000-0001-8854-1343",,,,,73,10,11,0,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

A natural consequence of such an apprehension probability is the possible multiplicity of the equilibrium due to strategic complementarity, and the actual offense rate is realized by the self-fulfilling nature of the offense rate. If people believe that lowering the fine will lead to a lower offense rate, each individual will be less inclined to commit an illegal activity due to their expectation of a higher apprehension probability.

The two kinds of workers regard themselves as distinct kinds of people and are now best seen as distinct social classes. While the sociology of India has broadly accepted the manual/non-manual labour distinction as the crucial marker of the boundary between the working and the middle classes, what is suggested here is that that between naukri (secure employment) and kam (insecure wage labour) - which cuts right across that distinction and is broadly congruent with that between formal- and informal-sector employment - is a more important marker of difference. At work, the two kinds of workforce are sharply distinguished by the material rewards of their jobs and by their security and conditions of employment; outside it by differences in life-style and attitudes - a gap that has grown with the liberalization of the Indian economy. The composition of the work groups to which the two kinds of labour characteristically belong are sharply differentiated by gender, by regional ethnicity and by urban or rural residence. Interactions within the work group are again very different, while interactions between regular and contract workers are largely confined to the work itself. Outside it they are kept to a minimum, testifying to a shared sense that socially the two kinds of workforce are profoundly different.","[Parry, Jonathan] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Parry, J (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",jpparry@ndirect.co.uk,,,,,,,28,47,50,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0308-5147,,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Commercial airline safety has improved dramatically since the industry's birth over a century ago. Fatal accident rates for large scheduled jet airlines have fallen to the level where (along many dimensions) aviation is now the safest mode of commercial transportation. However, safety performance has not been evenly distributed across all segments of commercial aviation, nor among all countries and regions of the world. The finding that developing countries have much poorer safety records has been a persistent conclusion in aviation safety research and continues to be the case. Unfortunately, operations data are not available for many of the airlines that experience fatal accidents, so it is not possible to calculate reliable fatality rates for many segments of the worldwide aviation industry. Without more complete information, it will likely be difficult to make substantial improvements in the safety of these operations. Challenges to improving aviation security include: how much to focus on identifying the terrorists as opposed to identifying the tools they might use; determining how to respond to terrorist threats; and determining the public versus private roles in providing aviation security. The next generation of safety challenges now require development and understanding of new forms of data to improve safety in other segments of commercial aviation, and moving from a reactive, incident-based approach toward a more proactive, predictive and systems-based approach.

Using institutional knowledge, I extend the existing theory on explicit and implicit contracts to include learning, a critical element of contracting in the movie industry. Subsequently, I show results consistent with the theory using a unique data set from a Spanish movie exhibitor with detailed information on the use of formal contracts and ex post contractual adjustments. My results show that distributors are more likely to use formal contracts for movies of higher expected value. Consistent with well-established results of the relational contracting literature, distributors use formal contracts to deter exhibitors' opportunistic behavior since their reneging temptations from implicit agreements are strongest for this type of movies. Conditional on using a formal contract, I find that ex post renegotiation is more likely to occur when the movie performs below expectations.","[Gil, Ricard] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Gil, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rgil@ucsc.edu,,"Gil, Ricard/0000-0003-3627-0988",,,,,34,20,22,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

By the time the NSW government abruptly cancelled the entire Metro project in early 2010, the authority had conceived and designed a contract that was proceeding to procurement. This paper examines the nature of the proposed Sydney Metro contract in relation to its performance framework and compares this to the frameworks in current contracts for bus, rail and ferry public transport in Sydney. Against this background, the paper examines the extent to which the Sydney Metro approach has had an impact on subsequent public transport contracts in the context of the literature on public private contracting and incentives for public transport procurement. The paper concludes that little has been implemented, although the other mode contracts now enable more performance measurement and incentivisation. In particular, the decision to award contracts to existing (and mostly public sector) operators appears to have acted as a brake on developing these performance elements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research has focused on whether a forecast is rational, meaning that the forecasts are unbiased and the actual forecast errors are uncorrelated with information available at the time of the forecast. These traditional tests assumed that the forecast loss function is quadratic and symmetric. The literature has found that budget forecasts often under-predict revenue and use the available information inefficiently. Using Californian data, I reach the same conclusion using similar tests. However, the rejection of forecast rationality might be the result of an asymmetric loss function. Once the asymmetry of the loss function is taken into account using a flexible loss function, I find evidence that under-forecasting is less costly than over-forecasting California's revenues. I also find that the forecast errors that take this asymmetry into account are independent of information available at the time of the forecast. These results indicate that a failure to control for possible asymmetry in the loss function in previous work may have produced misleading results. (C) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters.

However, the widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICT) may lead to a higher degree of decentralisation. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the geographical distribution of KIS across European regions, highlighting some important patterns. Our results confirm that the location of KIS remains linked to regions with a high international profile but, contrary to what some previous studies have suggested, the relative concentration of KIS is rather low. However, important differences exist depending on the type of KIS, the country analysed and the comparative statistical level. Recent trends also present uneven results, but show a higher concentration of business services-related KIS. The importance of tacit knowledge may play a role in explaining this result.","[Merino, Fernando] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Empresa, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Rubalcaba, Luis] Univ Alcala de Henares, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain",University of Murcia; Universidad de Alcala,"Rubalcaba, L (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Plaza Victoria 2, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain.",fmerino@um.es; luis.rubalcaba@uah.es,"Rubalcaba, Luis/AAQ-8219-2020; Merino, Fernando/C-3234-2012; Rubalcaba, Luis/AAW-9204-2020","Merino, Fernando/0000-0002-4426-6623; Rubalcaba, Luis/0000-0001-5724-9091",,,,,56,16,19,1,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

According to special formulas developed for the analysis of high capacity BRT corridors, the critical section of TransMilenio has a practical capacity of 48,000 passengers per hour per direction with its existing infrastructure and 150 passengers per bus 35,000 passengers per hour per direction with 110 passengers per bus. Changes in existing infrastructure, such as additional platforms, higher capacity vehicles, non-grade facilities at critical intersections, among other improvements, may increase the capacity, speed, reliability and quality of service of the system.

The analysis will be performed using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) with annual data from 1986 to 2009 for 26 Swedish counties. The analysis shows how the efficiency of the individual counties has changed over time. The results are used to provide a ranking (in terms of efficiency) of the Swedish public transport authorities that can provide a basis for benchmarking. It is concluded that the efficiency of the public transport providers in all counties fell during the observed time period. Defining cost efficiency as the ratio of minimum cost to observed cost, the overall (average) cost efficiency for the industry fell from 85.7% in the eighties to 60.4% for the period from 2000 to 2009. Possible explanations for the development include increased emphasis on route density as well as higher environmental and safety requirements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the impact of the policy, I exploit variation in the timing of the policy adoption across local courts.

This question is by no means new or surprising; but what is really puzzling is that dedicated research efforts have failed to provide consistent evidence on this issue. Therefore, the 'business case' for sustainability is controversial, despite the fact that companies are more and more under pressure to standardize and expand their voluntary ethical practices. The research design serves the purpose of answering some of these questions: 77 large industrial European companies were included in a highly-relevant new dataset, containing aggregated greenhouse gas emission figures, as well as universally-accepted financial performance indicators. On these balanced panel data we conducted several types of analyses, tailored to capture the sign and strength of the relationship between environmental and financial performance. We also introduced an innovative measure of responsible governance, as an interaction term between board-level innovations and the level of independent assurance. Our results are mixed, largely dependent on different model specifications and the several procedures to obtain robust standard errors. As expected, there is no definitive conclusion on the aforementioned relationship. Responsible governance seems to have an insignificant contribution to real sustainability performance, as well as to the economic welfare of the firm. Overall, we support the results to be found in the prior literature, in that CSR attributes - here including emission reduction efforts - will bear higher costs, but also higher revenues, resulting in a neutral relationship between CSR activity and firm financial performance. Owing to the uniqueness of the database in use and to the complexity of the econometric analysis, our findings are another proof of the controversy surrounding the relationship between firm financial and environmental performance.","Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Int Accounting & Financial Reporting, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragomir, VD (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Fac Accounting & Management Informat Syst, Dept Int Accounting & Financial Reporting, Bucharest, Romania.",voicudragomir@gmail.com,"Dragomir, Voicu D./B-6745-2012","Dragomir, Voicu D./0000-0003-3704-6996",,,,,38,5,5,0,61,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The evaluation of projects is usually done in isolation, without any connection to other projects or without taking into account dependencies between the projects. This paper aims to specify the problem of optimization of development of a project portfolio under risk (optimal allocation of scarce resources). The article offers two approaches to the optimization. The first approach is based on deterministic equivalents with application of bivalent programming (multi-criteria and mono-criteria optimization). The second one uses stochastic optimization based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The application of these model approaches can greatly improve the quality of the project portfolio development under risk.","[Fotr, Jiri; Svecova, Lenka] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Prague, Czech Republic; [Plevny, Miroslav; Vacik, Emil] Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Fotr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Prague, Czech Republic.",jiri.fotr@vse.cz; plevny@kem.zcu.cz; lenka.svecova@vse.cz; vacik@kpm.zcu.cz,"Švecová, Lenka/AAE-5194-2021; Plevny, Miroslav/J-9489-2015","Švecová, Lenka/0000-0002-0329-2921; Plevny, Miroslav/0000-0003-4774-0877; Fotr, Jiri/0000-0003-3698-7516",,,,,34,10,10,6,32,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

By analysing contractual practices in the provision of natural gas to manufacturing industries (pricing, take-or-pay clauses, contract duration), we show that complex agreements are becoming formalized, with a high degree of customization (menu of contracts). We argue that the aim is to gain private information about customer preferences (e.g., attitude toward risk) in order to better match offers with customer needs. Not all firms, however, have the same level of contractual competencies so the most capable ones are able to use their distinctive competencies to achieve a competitive advantage.

Estimates from rolling window method show that FDI and RIR are negatively related to economic growth for the years 1987-1988, 1992-1999, 2002-2006, 2008 and 2009; and 1986-1998, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

While subject to a considerable amount of uncertainty, the prospect of such a dramatic weakening of public finances is likely to trigger demands for welfare reforms characterized by a more individualized system of public transfer and tax payments, in addition to measures already taken to address the fiscal effects of population ageing.","[Jacobsen, Rasmus Hojbjerg] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Econ & Business Res, DK-2000 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,,rhj.cebr@cbs.dk; shj.eco@cbs.dk,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,"SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES, INST ECONOMIC RESEARCH",BRATISLAVA 1,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA 1, 811 05, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-7144-214-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,104,116,,,,,,13,Demography; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Demography; Business & Economics,BA4JV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000335871100008,0

Two monetary DSGE models are estimated, namely, a standard CIA model and a CIA model with a Taylor rule. This article uses the Bayesian method to estimate the model, and the estimated and inferred results are credible due to the Markov chain reaching convergence. The results show that the augmented model outperforms the standard CIA model in terms of capturing inflation persistence. Further studies show that inflation persistence mainly comes from the persistence of the money supply, while money supply uncertainty, the reaction coefficient of monetary growth to productivity, productivity persistence and productivity uncertainty have a smaller impact on inflation persistence. Changes of monetary policy have little effect on inflation persistence.","[Liao, Ying; Hu, Ridong] Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Fujian, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University,"Hu, RD (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Fujian, Peoples R China.",j_rdhu@hqu.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,1,1,2,22,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

However, there are deficiencies within the local automotive component manufacturers' (ACMs) supplier base and therefore automotive assemblers, or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), have to import many of their parts requirements. These deficiencies are caused by ACMs' lack of technology, global supply capability, cost competitiveness and their geographic location (ACMs are scattered across the country). A study was conducted to explore the supply chain challenges South African ACMs face and whether the location, size and age of participating ACMs have a bearing on whether they face the same challenges. The results revealed that the most significant supply chain challenges in South Africa were in the customer relationship category. From the hypotheses testing, the conclusion could be drawn that, in general, participating ACMs face common supply chain challenges, irrespective of their location, age and size.

Stopping rules affect both the number of children and the sex composition of these children. Parents whose first child is male will stop having children sooner than parents whose first child is female. On average, parents of a first-born son will have fewer children and will have a higher proportion of sons compared to parents of a first-born daughter. An economic model in which sons bring economic benefits and daughters bring economic costs, shows the importance of sex composition on child outcomes: holding the number of siblings constant, boys are better off with sisters and girls are better off with brothers. Empirical evidence using the sex outcome of first births as a natural experiment shows that stopping rules can exacerbate discrimination, causing as much as a quarter of excess female child mortality. Another implication of the research is that the use of sex-selective abortion may lower female mortality, but raise male mortality.","[Rosenblum, Daniel] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Rosenblum, Daniel] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Toronto, ON M5B 1W8, Canada",Dalhousie University; University of Toronto; Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto,"Rosenblum, D (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",Daniel.Rosenblum@dal.ca,,"Rosenblum, Daniel/0000-0003-0056-9734",,,,,54,48,57,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

For each single passenger, the algorithm builds a ranked list of available targets (seats and standing areas) according to their preferences and selects the most convenient one. The algorithm is fitted to work with a generic parametric passenger model and allow differentiating several passenger types managing their preferences regarding the entry door, seat location and standing area, among others. The differences in these preferences allow us to distinguish the types of bus passenger. The algorithm also takes into account the variation of preferences according to the amount of passengers onboard. Four fill-in modes from a nearly empty bus to maximum capacity have been implemented. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, two case studies have been implemented within the XJTEK AnyLogic simulation environment. The decision making algorithm has been used to model the behaviour of the eight types of passengers in two different bus layouts, one with three doors and the other with five. The types of passengers were defined by Chalmers University of Technology in a previous work from 100 observations at bus stops and onboard buses in Gothenburg, Bremerhaven and Rome. The results prove that the passenger decision making algorithm can be effectively used to evaluate a new design of a bus layout using agent-based simulation techniques estimating the parameters that measure quality of service (passengers' satisfaction and dwell time among others).

In addition to the professional service items and quality, the adjustment of business strategies aimed at the changeable environment are considered as key success factors in the tourism industry. This study analyzes the effect of business strategies on organisational performance in the tourism industry. Owners, managers, and employees from the top ten travel agencies in Taiwan were selected as the research subjects and a total of 600 questionnaires were distributed. Within the retrieved 438 surveys, 43 were incomplete and removed to yield a total of 395 valid questionnaires. Within the empirical analyses business strategies appear to have significant positive correlations with job satisfaction, organisational objective and job performance in organisational performance. Moreover, organisational culture presents a partially moderating effect for the relations between business strategies and organisational performance.","[Wu, Yueh-Hsin] Cheng Shiu Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Niaosong, Taiwan; [Lin, Mong-Mei] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan",Cheng Shiu University; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Lin, MM (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan.",mmlin@nutc.edu.tw,,,,,,,17,4,6,0,46,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The firm-level mechanisms of how such institutional changes have affected firm behaviours are not well understood, however. This study examines the relationship between the shareholder value orientation of firms and financial rewards for the executive managers who run those companies. Using compensation data for 290 CEOs for an 11-year period, I demonstrate that CEOs at the firms with the appearance of shareholder value orientation - such as monitoring and incentive-alignment mechanisms - receive greater compensation than non-shareholder-value-orientation CEOs. Moreover, when the firms strengthen the appearance of shareholder value orientation, CEO pay increases the subsequent year. This suggests that firms adopt monitoring and incentive-alignment mechanisms in order to gain the appearance of shareholder value orientation rather than to curb executive compensation. By employing such symbolic management tactics, top managers at such firms earn greater legitimacy, a better reputation, and a higher valuation of the firms and executive talent. The findings suggest that executive compensation has played an important role in providing incentives for top managers to make strategic decisions that conform to the shareholder value maximisation principle.","Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Shin, T (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",tshin@illinois.edu,"Shin, Taekjin/P-8448-2019","Shin, Taekjin/0000-0001-8247-5541",,,,,67,11,16,0,30,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The model captures the main linkages between the demand for freight transport, the characteristics of the vehicle fleet, and the demand for fuel. Results include the following. First, we precisely define and estimate a rebound effect of improvements in fuel efficiency in the trucking industry: behavioural adjustments in the industry imply that an exogenous improvement in fuel efficiency reduces fuel use less than proportionately. Our best estimate of this effect is approximately 10% in the short run and 17% in the long run, so that a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency reduces fuel use by 0.90% (short-run) to 0.83% (long-run). Second, we find that higher fuel prices raise the average capacity of trucks, and they induce firms to invest in newer, typically more fuel efficient, trucks. Third, these adjustments and the rebound effect jointly imply that the effect of higher fuel prices on fuel use in the trucking industry is fairly small; estimated price elasticities are -0.13 and -0.22 in the short run and in the long run, respectively. The empirical results of this paper have implications for judging the implications of fuel efficiency standards and regulations with respect to larger trucks in the EU. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show through ethnographic fieldwork in Uttar Pradesh how a shared sense of young male limbo sometimes erodes caste divides. While waiting in poorly provisioned north Indian universities, young men develop novel cultures that bridge caste, class and religion. They also collaborate across class, caste and religious boundaries in protests against the state and university bureaucracies. At the same time, some students have responded to a sense of waiting by developing collusive relationships with local government and university bureaucrats. Waiting emerges not as a passive condition but as a seed-bed for new cultural and political forms.","[Jeffrey, Craig] Univ Oxford St Johns Coll, Oxford OX1 3JP, England; [Young, Stephen] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Oxford; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Jeffrey, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford St Johns Coll, Oxford OX1 3JP, England.",craig.jeffrey@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Jeffrey, Craig J/A-4740-2013","Jeffrey, Craig/0000-0001-7263-8992",,,,,63,35,37,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using a tailor-made panel database for regions in these two countries, we show that both countries exhibit increasingly strong polarization of innovative capacity in a limited number of urban areas. But the factors behind this polarization and the strong contrasts in innovative capacity between the provinces and states within both countries are quite different. In China, the concentration of innovation is fundamentally driven by agglomeration forces, linked to population, industrial specialization and infrastructure endowment. Innovative areas in China, rather than generate knowledge spillovers, seem to produce strong backwash effects. In India, by contrast, innovation is much more dependent on a combination of good local socioeconomic structures and investment in science and technology. Indian innovation hubs also generate positive knowledge spillovers to other regions.","[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres; Storper, Michael] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Crescenzi, Riccardo/0000-0003-0465-9796",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J021342/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,86,102,112,4,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Another parameter of competition is innovation. This raises the question of how competition law should assess potential restraints of competition in innovation. Modern competition policy advocates an effects-based approach that analyzes cases in light of the economic effects on relevant markets. Firms also compete in existing markets when they try to improve their products sold in these markets or optimize processes for manufacturing those products. However, as it was first discussed in merger control law, an analysis limited to the effects on existing markets may fail to assess cases appropriately when firms are not yet competitors but dispose of innovation capacity for future markets. Whereas a merger among such firms will not harm existing price competition, it may well have a negative effect on the new firms incentives to innovate. For addressing this phenomenon, the U.S. agencies in particular started to analyze cases also in the light of so-called innovation markets in the 1990s. Yet this new approach was also criticized. Indeed, the idea of an innovation market remained at best a metaphor, since there are no transactions between suppliers and customers of innovation before tradable technologies and products emerge from RD efforts. Therefore, both the most recent U.S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines and the EU Guidelines on Horizontal Cooperation Agreements have now given up the idea of an innovation market concept in favor of a U.S. innovation competition and EU competition in innovation concept. This change confirms that competition in innovation takes place outside and before the emergence of markets. If this is so, modern competition law, which strongly focuses on market analysis, may face a major problem in addressing restraints of competition in innovation appropriately. The following article analyzes this problem against the background of EU competition law for the different fields of enforcementmergers, agreements, and unilateral conductby also taking into account most recent cases. The article highlights that an analysis based on the effects on existing markets can only work as a rough proxy in such cases. Most importantly, in the field of unilateral conduct, the requirement of market dominance at the time of the abuse under Article 102 of the TFEU considerably limits the capability of enforcers to act against restraints of competition in innovation.","[Drexl, Josef] Max Planck Inst Intellectual Property & Competit, Munich, Germany; [Drexl, Josef] Univ Munich, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Munich,"Drexl, J (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Intellectual Property & Competit, Munich, Germany.",josef.drexl@ip.mpg.de,,,,,,,34,11,11,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

During this entry process, capability gaps arise that need to be bridged to exploit the commercial opportunity and grow the business. Using a global retailer, Tesco plc, as a case study and employing grounded theory development techniques, we find that to achieve growth, two organizational attributes become critical-structural coherence of the firm's capabilities and organizational identity. We identify three processes of capability development during market entry-transference, splicing and enhanced imitation. Further, actions and processes that maintain or adapt organizational identity serve as moderators of the relationship between these processes and the capability deployment and internalization necessary for entry into international markets. We discuss the study's implications for theories of capability development, organizational identity and foreign market entry.","[George, Gerard; Alexy, Oliver] Imperial Coll London, Sch Business, Kensington SW7 2AZ, England; [Lowe, Michelle] Univ Southampton, Sch Management, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Alexy, Oliver] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Management, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Imperial College London; University of Southampton; Technical University of Munich,"George, G (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Sch Business, Kensington SW7 2AZ, England.",g.george@imperial.ac.uk,"Alexy, Oliver T/E-9819-2010; GEORGE, Gerard/J-4061-2012","GEORGE, Gerard/0000-0002-6963-5085; George, Gerard/0000-0002-9898-0566",ESRC [ES/H046569/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H046569/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,16,17,0,87,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In particular, a unique database was used, created by reading eight hundred sentences pronounced by the Italian Regional Administrative Courts of first instance (Tribunali Amministrativi Regionali), located in each of the 20 regions in Italy, between 2000 and 2007. After a preliminary analysis of the data, regarding the duration of disputes, their objects and other relevant variables, an econometric study was performed to verify whether the length of administrative disputes may be explained, together with other causes, by the complexity of the legal system. The indicator used as a proxy of normative complexity was developed in previous studies in this field. Different kinds of models were used and specifications performed to render the empirical results more robust. The outcome of the analysis appears to support the idea that normative complexity may be a burden on the activity of courts, and that this could contribute to explaining the slowness of justice proceedings.","Univ Catania, Fac Law, I-95124 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Di Vita, G (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Fac Law, Via Gallo N 24, I-95124 Catania, Italy.",gdivita@lex.unict.it,"Di+Vita, Giuseppe/AAD-9924-2020","Di Vita, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1916-1544",,,,,30,12,12,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

While China has shown a very fast learning capability in conducting competition analysis, further capacity building in China is crucial. There is no clear evidence of industrial policy considerations being at the forefront in the eight published decisions by the Ministry of Commerce to date, except for its very early decisions. We propose a competition-neutral principle, which requires that a competition test be conducted before, and independently from, any consideration of industrial policy and argue that industrial policy matters only for competition-neutral mergers. On a more technical level, if China adopts the total welfare standard, then its treatment of efficiencies and the meaning of sufficiency of entry post merger should be modified accordingly from the US/EU consumer-oriented model.","[Lin, Ping] Lingnan Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jingjing] Norton Rose Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University,"Lin, P (通讯作者)，Lingnan Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, 8 Castle Peak Rd, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",plin@ln.edu.hk; Jingjing.Zhao@nortonrose.com,"Zhao, Xujun/IRZ-4119-2023","LIN, Ping/0000-0002-0641-6440",,,,,18,8,9,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

An alternative approach to fighting corruption is to rely on bottom-up monitoring. This article investigates the effectiveness of an accountability system that combines bottom-up monitoring and top-down auditing using data from a specifically designed bribery lab experiment. I compare public officials' tendency to ask for bribes under: (1) no monitoring, (2) conventional top-down auditing, and (3) an accountability system that gives citizens the possibility of reporting corrupt officials, knowing that reports lead to top-down auditing with some low probability (the same as in (2)). The experimental results suggest that combined accountability systems can be highly effective in curbing corruption, even when citizens' voice leads to formal top-down punishment with a relatively low probability.","Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Serra, D (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",dserra@fsu.edu,,,,,,,24,62,67,0,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Research focuses on the impact of foreign immigration on three specific dynamics: population growth and distribution/segregation of both Spanish and foreign populations within the metropolitan area; their respective residential mobility patterns; and consequences on their age and sex structure. Results show that there are remarkable differences between the two populations: foreign immigrants have preferably settled in the core city's least affluent neighbourhoods and, in a second phase, in inner ring municipalities, while the Spanish population continues to move to suburban municipalities.","[Bayona-Carrasco, Jordi; Gil-Alonso, Fernando] Univ Barcelona, Dept Geog Humana, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Bayona-Carrasco, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Geog Humana, Barcelona, Spain.",jordibayona@ub.edu; fgil@ub.edu,"Bayona, Jordi/JMR-0884-2023; Gil-Alonso, Fernando/AAL-4794-2021","Gil-Alonso, Fernando/0000-0002-8910-1881; Bayona-i-Carrasco, Jordi/0000-0003-2819-9085",,,,,59,64,64,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

The present study applies this argument to an analysis of women's self-employment in the U.S. South during the Great Depression. Census data show that in large southern cities in 1940, the unemployment of black women was meaningfully reduced by the self-employment of these women in domestic service. These data further suggest that dynamics of race, unemployment, and the self-employment of women in domestic service can be represented by an inverted-U-shaped labor absorption curve. These results make several contributions to research on race, labor-market disadvantage, and self-employment in the informal sector.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Sociol, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Boyd, RL (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Sociol, 207 Bowen Hall,Hardy Rd, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",boyd@soc.msstate.edu,"Boyd, Robert L./ABF-2610-2020","Boyd, Robert L./0000-0001-8729-7430",,,,,24,4,11,1,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

First, workers growing up in intact families during childhood earn more during their adulthood because they acquire more years of schooling, which in turn affect their wages positively. Second, intact family background acts as an instrument for numerous factors that contribute to workers' happiness during adulthood. Since happier workers, with other characteristics held constant, are known to have higher earnings, workers raised in intact families during childhood by leading a relatively happier life during their adulthood earn more than their otherwise identical non-intact counterparts. Both these hypotheses find strong support from the US data. The evidence of simultaneous relationships between wage and happiness and between happiness and schooling confirms that the true effect of INTACT on wage may be much larger than what is envisaged by a simple one-step process. Regardless of whether this relationship is due to causation or correlation, the study simply demonstrates that the US evidence of higher earnings associated with workers raised in intact families may be attributed partly to their higher levels of schooling and happier lives. By demonstrating a significant positive relationship between the stability of parental family structure during childhood and earnings during adulthood, the current study highlights the importance of responsible parenthood as a means of improving the child's future economic performance.","[Mohanty, Madhu S.] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Econ & Stat, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Ullah, Aman] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Mohanty, MS (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Econ & Stat, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",mmohant@calstatela.edu; Aman.ullah@ucr.edu,"ullah, aman/JQW-5104-2023","ullah, aman/0000-0002-7822-9222",,,,,48,9,11,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The mechanism underpinning this outcome results from the fact that counterfeiters can generate net revenues for the luxury monopolist because (1) sanctions imposed to counterfeiters are shaped and pocketed by the luxury monopolist under cover of deterrence (2) costs and profit loss due to counterfeiters and incurred by the luxury monopolist can be less than what is usually assumed. Moreover, the presence of counterfeits can be considered as promotional devices that signal the true luxury cachet, increases the snob value of the counterfeited brand and rewards high-end designers in a non-monetary way.

An 8% increase in densities experienced over the 2002-2007 period implies a welfare loss of at least 75 M(ss)/year.

These large, city-wide transportation projects are often central to larger urban revitalization plans intending to foster economic growth and alter city images to both residents and to outsiders. Crucial to the success of such ambitions is a system that provides equitable access to all residents and one that provides access to a large number of urban opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatial accessibility landscape created by newly implemented BRT system in Cali, Colombia in terms of both access to the system itself and access to three distinct activities around the city. In particular, the equitable distribution of accessibility patterns is explored in relation to neighborhood socio-economic strata. Findings indicate that walking access to the BRT system is greatest for middle income groups and most limited for neighborhoods in the highest and lowest socio-economic strata. Accessibility values to activities are largely bound to the spatial distribution pattern of activities; most equitable for intentionally dispersed recreation site, and least for spatially clustered hospitals.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate this proximity by analyzing Calabresi's works published in the 1960s. The argument we develop is that differences, and similarities, are deeper than what is usually assumed. First, methodologically, it can be said that Calabresi envisaged an economic analysis of liability rules while Coase adopted a law and economics perspective. Then, analytically, it can be shown that Calabresi proposed an invariance thesis. We compare it to Coase's results and to Stigler's Coase theorem and show that the invariance thesis can indeed be found in Coase's The Problem of Social Cost but was absent from Stigler's version of the Coase theorem that was restricted to an efficiency thesis. We also show that Calabresi moved from the invariance to the efficiency thesis when he established a Coase axiom. However, Calabresi, just like Coase and Stigler, but for different reasons, believed that the axiom is theoretically valid but in fact inaccurate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The problem is highly significant because of the fact that the common European Union policy does not include many questions of animal welfare, such as variety of systems for agricultural production, climate conditions or others. One of the main mechanisms of the CAP is cross-compliance. It was found that the principles of cross-compliance are closely related and are important in the implementation of measures for the sustainable development of agriculture. These requirements should be met by beneficiaries in order to obtain financial aid for production, for maximal reduction of a negative impact of agricultural activities on the environment and the health safety of humans and animals, animal welfare and food security.

The development of the insurance offer government a financial method which, by using the market mechanism, can strengthen the economic security of the low-income groups. The supply of rural micro-insurance helps, to enhance self-protection ability of the low-income groups, to build and improve a harmonious social security mechanism, to improve the rural financial system. This is the purpose of our study. The essay can be divided into four parts. Part I, we introduce the domestic and international research literature and the development of Chinese rural micro insurance. We evaluate the research result from the demand factors and empirical survey analysis mode of operation external environment construction. We also give a description to the try outs and development status of rural micro life insurance. Part II, Analysis on the demands of micro life insurance. We analysis the demand factors of micro life insurance by using the social questionnaire and quantitative method. We got 453 questionnaire from the farmers of shandong, hebei and tianjin county. Data processing results show that there is disparity between the potential demand and the real demand. Then we use the Logistic regression to examine whether the factor like the level of income, age, educational level, whether or not have commercial insurance and the level of the willingness to pay premium, have a significant association with the rusult. Our result suggests that the first four factors have a significant association of 90% with the rusult ,howerer,the last is not significant to the demand. PartIII, Analysis on the supplies of micro life insurance. We introduce the present situation of the incurance supply and point out that the supply of the micro life insurance is a breakthrough which adjusts the limitation of the traditional insurable by using the homogeneous risk, stratification of consideration, low rate method ,which has the combination function of commercial insurance and social insurance. We analysis the advantages and disadvantages of the three operation mode,point out the problems in operation. Then we puts forward that Government support, business operations,diversified,broad coverage is a better way to supply micro life insurance. We also analysis the economic and empirical feasibility.

The results show that South African firms have target leverage ratios and adjust their capital structures from time to time to achieve their respective targets, that the relationship between firm age and debt financing is non-monotonic, and that firms with higher collateral value are likely to face fewer constraints on borrowing and therefore have greater access to medium-term and long-term debts. Robustness tests also reveal that during start-up and maturity stages, a firm's access to debt markets is significantly influenced by investments in assets that are acceptable to external creditors as collateral. These findings suggest that debt financing policies could be more critical for firms in the start-up and maturity stages.","[Ezeoha, Abel; Botha, Ferdi] Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Ezeoha, A (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Grahamstown, South Africa.",,,,,,,,43,16,17,0,16,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

J,"Graham, P; Mulley, C",,,,"Graham, Peter; Mulley, Corinne",,,Public transport pre-pay tickets: Understanding passenger choice for different products,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fares; Ticketing; Prepayment; Cashless; Public transport,,"Growing cashless services in the Sydney metropolitan region are motivated by the clear supply-side benefits associated with the prepayment of public transport fares. This paper examines the effect on prepay following the 'MyZone' fare and ticket reform in New South Wales introduced in April 2010. 'MyZone', introduced two new discounted and standardised prepay products, including a new, multimode ticket. Whilst these changes had implications for all public transport providers in the Sydney Metropolitan area, it had significant ramifications for the many private bus operators who, for the first time, could provide and accept tickets, which integrated their services with the state-run rail, ferry and bus network. With empirical data collected from two surveys of passengers of a private bus operator in northern Sydney this study analyses the ticket purchasing behaviour of passengers both before the fare reform, when passengers only had access to operator-specific prepay products, and post-MyZone, when the new standardised prepay products were available. The results clearly show there are significant differences in the characteristics of passengers using multi-modal versus pay-as-you-go tickets and that this difference is driven largely by age, income and whether or not the journey involved interchange. Prior to MyZone, prepay users were easily predicted and the fare and ticket reform was successful in transitioning some cash users to prepay but prepay users were no longer predictable unless separated into prepay product groups. This suggests that a policy designed to exploit the supply-side benefits associated with cashless services needs to consider that introducing only one prepay product will not address the market need of frequent users. Passengers who continued to pay cash after the fare and ticket reform showed high sensitivity to public transport cost and are those passengers with the lowest incomes. This raises policy questions of how to mitigate against the upfront costs often associated with prepay to transition less affluent, but frequent passengers, onto cashless ticketing.

Technological changes are important for effective supply chain management (SCM). However, the main cause of SCM improvements are organizational changes and an integration of business processes that lead to more mature processes in all involved companies and at the supply chain level. In the paper it is analysed how SC efficiency is related to business-process orientation (BPO) which is measured by SCM maturity level. On one side higher level of BPO is a prerequisite for significant changes, integration, and efficiency improvements of SC business processes.

Knowledge as a part of companies' and the whole society intangible assets have been getting fundamental importance during last years as they have been perceived to be important source of the competitive advantages The main interest is focused on people oriented knowledge management in this paper. Possibilities for development were explored in methods and practices of strategic human resource management. There was revealed what kind of procedures, activities and processes are being perceived as important and useful to develop. The respondents assigned Teams, Cooperation, Activity, Culture and Strategy as the domains being the most important for knowledge potential development in the future. Next data were acquired by comparing the evaluation of the present situation and the future needs. There was found a difference between the present estate and the future estate (chance for future) and between the present importance and present use of opportunities (chance at present). Methods and activities of human resource management could be used for resolving of actual problems and for future knowledge potential development. The knowledge potential development can be also perceived as application field, where specific instruments of knowledge management as well as instruments of human resources management can be put into effect.","Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Podnikove Ekonomiky & Managementu, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Jermár, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Katedra Podnikove Ekonomiky & Managementu, Plzen, Czech Republic.",jermar@kpm.zcu.cz,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,13,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In addition, although research has identified transport disadvantaged groups based on their size of activity space, these studies have, however, not empirically explained such differences and the result is often a poor identification of the problems facing disadvantaged groups. Research has shown that transport disadvantage varies over time. The static nature of analysis using the activity space concept in previous research studies has lacked the ability to identify transport disadvantage in time. Activity space is a dynamic concept: and therefore possesses a great potential in capturing temporal variations in behaviour and access opportunities. This research derives measures of the size and fullness of activity spaces for 157 individuals for weekdays, weekends, and for a week using weekly activity-travel diary data from three case study areas located in rural Northern Ireland. Four focus groups were also conducted in order to triangulate quantitative findings and to explain the differences between different socio-spatial groups. The findings of this research show that despite having a smaller sized activity space, individuals were not disadvantaged because they were able to access their required activities locally. Car-ownership was found to be an important life line in rural areas. Temporal disaggregation of the data reveals that this is true only on weekends due to a lack of public transport services. In addition, despite activity spaces being at a similar size, the fullness of activity spaces of low-income individuals was found to be significantly lower compared to their high-income counterparts. Focus group data shows that financial constraint, poor connections both between public transport services and between transport routes and opportunities forced individuals to participate in activities located along the main transport corridors.

The level and nature of collaboration between academic research and industry in the Indian automotive sector can be explained by the nature of the technology, the locus of technical decision making in this sector, the maturity level of Indian companies, and the maturity of academic research itself. The study finds that the most prevalent form of collaboration between companies and academia is competency development and training while the second most prevalent form is the provision of research services (testing and analytical services). Research partnerships between industry and academia are uncommon. In such a context, government support for research partnerships can bring industry and academia closer together, and create a stage for future collaboration, but commercialization of technology is unlikely.","[Krishnan, Rishikesha T.; Jha, Srivardhini K.] Indian Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Krishnan, RT (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",rishi@IIMB.ERNET.IN,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The furniture manufacturers form a close partnership with their immediate business environment (the suppliers, customers, retailers and support industries) to enhance the process of interactive learning. The mutual exchange and shared learning process in the cluster are best described as socially constructed and socially embedded processes that are highly associated with the element of trust within the cluster; in addition, tacit knowledge tends to become embedded in the local milieu. The relationship among the community and the furniture industry players is also close. There is a strong social capital and mutual understanding among competitors to see one another as partners, especially in advancing their knowledge in the international markets. The achievement of the Muar furniture cluster is built upon the collective efforts of the entire Muar furniture industry. Firms are always ready to share business opportunities and information. However, the cluster still lacks the design and technological capabilities to move to the original design manufacturing and original brand manufacturing stage.","[Ng, Boon-Kwee; Kanagasundram, Thiruchelvam] Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Chandran, V.

The sample of the study includes all the voting stocks traded at CSE. Stocks are selected for the strategies implemented in this study based on their returns over the past 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and hold the selected stocks for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively This gives a total of 16 strategies. In order to identify the relation between market states and momentum effect, the entire sample is divided into two sub periods, January 1995 to September 2001 and October 2001 to July 2008. The first sub period was mainly bearish and the second sub period was mainly bullish. For the overall sample, all the strategies show positive and statistically significant momentum effects. When there is a time lag between the formation period and the holding period, the most successful momentum strategy is the 12 months/3 months strategy where stocks are selected based on their returns over the past 12 months and then holds them for next 3 months. This strategy yields returns of 0.728 percent per month. Further, the momentum effect is stronger in the down market stance than in the up-market stance. In the up-market, virtually all the portfolios are winners since difference between return on the winner portfolios and return on the loser portfolios are negligible. By contrast, in the down-market stance, all the winner portfolios are positive while all the loser portfolios are negative. Hence the winner portfolios significantly outperform the loser portfolios.","[Pathirawasam, Chandrapala] Univ Kelaniya Sri Lanka, Fac Commerce & Management Studies, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka; [Kral, Milos] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",University Kelaniya; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Pathirawasam, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kelaniya Sri Lanka, Fac Commerce & Management Studies, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka.",Pathi3@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,1,2,0,9,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Considering the anxiety existing in the Latvian society, the aim of the paper is research and analyses of the conditions of building a sustainable pension system. In order to achieve the above mentioned aim, the authors describe the impact of economic and social factors on the sustainability of pension system, analyze the legislation regulating Latvian pension system, and formulate the criteria of sustainability. The following scientific research methods have been used in work: analytical method, comparative method, historical method, logically and abstractedly constructive method. As a result the authors conclude that, with the existing system, 70% replacement rate for old age pensions in Latvia is not a realistic goal and in order to reduce replacement rate administrative policy must stimulate reduction of bureaucracy and increasing of productivity of both private and public sectors. Social policy must stimulate increasing of the role of family to ensure welfare of retired persons.

With the implementation of the 3D CAD software (Three Dimensional Computer Aided Design) the world of engineers seemed to become a completely new and fascinating one in which the engineer is a 100% creative part in the New PD process of an innovative company - with all supporting activities taken over by a marvelous software, automatically and completely [1, p. 11]. Technical draughtspeople who did supporting activities so far declined rapidly and engineers have more or less lost their righthands, the technical draughtspeople [2], especially in mechanical development departments of medium-sized companies. Recent analysis of the workload of engineers under 3D CAD-conditions revealed -unsurprisingly - that at least one third of the hours of work are related to supporting activities, to distributable work [3, p. 189]. According to that situation these companies more or less lost the advantages of coherent work distribution and as a consequence of that the opportunity to overlap creative and routine activities between engineers and technical draughters. Based on the discussion of two important properties of the information to be exchanged, sensitivity and evolution [4, p. 440], this paper will show how overlapping can be processed from the creative to the executive phase between engineers and technical draughtspeople. Coherent work distribution plus overlapping procedures should finally increase the economic and socio-psychological efficiency of the development department and the company as a whole, measured by lead time, costs - including opportunity costs, quality and various soft facts. The subject of this paper is, to elaborate the reasoning for a cause-effect analysis which is in preparation by the author (see Addendum).","[Staita, Christoph] Kathrein Werke KG, D-83098 Brandenburg, Germany",,,christoph.staita@kathrein.de,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-519-8,,,,2012,,,,,,,657,667,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5EN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343750100059,0

Amsterdam has reached its rank thanks to a successful, global hub-and-spokes strategy led by KLM and its partners.

It is estimated by 2050 the population of African cities will triple from 410 million in 2010 to 1.23 billion. The ensuing travel demand is expected to aggravate chaos in transport systems for almost all major African cities. This paper analyses the emerging paradoxes in the BRT system in Dar as Salaam city where the provision of an organized, affordable and cost-effective public transport system has been eagerly awaited by city residents. However, the Dar Rapid Transit (DART) system, recently established, has astonishingly witnessed opposition from some of the city residents. Findings reveal that the underlying reasons for this paradoxical situation include absence of a current land use plan, ineffective land use control and little adherence to the legal provision for property compensation and resettlement. Lack of common understanding between the government and the affected people, deters the implementation of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in the city. A well organised and inclusive framework of stakeholders and a well structured information dissemination system are the pillars on which successful MRT system can be built. Compensation payment to affected people, at market price, cannot be avoided in MRT development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conceptually, between-mode differences in VTTS can be decomposed into the user type effect (UE) that accounts for differences in characteristics of user groups (e.g. income differences) and the mode effect (ME) that accounts for differences in travel modes (e.g. the comfort level). Several studies have disentangled and quantified these two effects. However, their potential use for project appraisal has not been thoroughly discussed in the literature. Two opportunities of using information about ME and UE in appraisal are discussed: (i) Removing the UE from national mode-specific VTTS in order to obtain a set of VITS that only differs by the comfort level of the modes (ii) Provide the VTTS in travel modes taking into account user type effects of travellers that switch modes after project implementation. The former arguably improves on the equity approach in project appraisal under the normative argument of valuing individual's time saving equally. The latter can improve the overall precision of user benefit representation in project appraisal compared to the standard mode-specific approach, where mode switchers are assumed to have the same VTTS in the new mode independent of which original user group they belong to.

We find that cash collateral is most likely to be used when the contract is governed by law that is favorable to debtors and that out-of-state borrowers who use favorable law pay higher yield spreads. In addition, when the law is favorable to lenders, there are significantly fewer covenant violations, and the repercussions of covenant violations-measured as changes in the borrower's investment policy-are more severe.

The primary feature of this method is to consider historical operations records by road management equipment type and weights by work type based on subjective preferences of the public agencies. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed as the main tool to reflect the relative importance of a day-to-day road management activity. In order to examine the appropriateness of our method, we performed a case study with 18 regional transportation offices in South Korea. The estimated cost of equipment purchases across these offices was approximately 41 million US dollars based on the 2011 year (when apply average unit cost by equipment), while the actual equipment purchase costs during the same one-year period were about 44 million US dollars. The main reason for the differences of estimates across offices is due to unit cost by equipment, road conditions, relative importance of management tasks, and omission of unused equipment in inventories and use of labor. We also developed estimates using the maximum unit costs by equipment, in order to provide an upper bound to the authorities. Using those values we estimated the annual cost at approximately 60 million dollars. The estimates developed can provide useful information to road authorities when they establish annual plans for road management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the intellectual heritage of this thesis, in the 'functional theory' of G.D.H. Cole and Otto Bauer and in the writings of Eduard Bernstein. It scrutinizes Polanyi's relationship with Bernstein's 'evolutionary socialism' and charts his 'double movement' vis-a-vis Marxist philosophy: in the 1910s he reacted sharply against Marxism's deterministic excesses, but he then, in the 1920s, engaged in sympathetic dialogue with Austro-Marxist thinkers. The latter, like Bernstein, disavowed economic determinism and insisted upon the importance and autonomy of ethics. Yet they simultaneously predicted a law-like expansion of democracy from the political to the economic arena. Analysis of this contradiction provides the basis for a concluding discussion that reconsiders the deterministic threads in Polanyi's oeuvre. Whereas for some Polanyi scholars these attest to his residual attraction to Marxism, I argue that matters are more complex. While Polanyi did repudiate the more rigidly deterministic of currents in Marxist philosophy, those to which he was attracted, notably Bernstein's 'revision' and Austro-Marxism, incorporated a deterministic fatalism of their own, in respect of democratization. Herein lies a more convincing explanation of Polanyi's incomplete escape from a deterministic philosophy of history, as exemplified in his masterwork, The great transformation.","Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Brunel University,"Dale, G (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Marie Jahoda Bldg, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",gareth.dale@brunel.ac.uk,"Dale, Gareth/AAV-7142-2020","Dale, Gareth/0000-0003-4991-6063",,,,,59,8,9,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The dynamic logit EWS is estimated using an exact maximum likelihood estimation method in both a country-by-country and a panel framework. The forecasting abilities of this model are then scrutinized using an evaluation methodology which was designed recently, specifically for EWSs. When used for predicting currency crises for 16 countries, this new EWS turns out to exhibit significantly better predictive abilities than the existing static one, both in- and out-of-sample, thus supporting the use of dynamic specifications for EWSs for financial crises.

These benefits can potentially allow countries to improve their comparative economic advantages. To better understand the impact of transportation infrastructure expenditures on national economies, the present paper undertakes an aggregate study of the relationship between transportation infrastructure expenditure and gross domestic product from economies in 40 countries. Three econometric frameworks (ordinary least squares, random-effects and random-parameters models) were used to investigate the impacts of transportation infrastructure expenditure across countries using data from 1992 to 2010. The random-parameters model was observed to adequately account for possible unobserved heterogeneity across countries. As expected, the estimation results showed considerable variability across countries, with the impact of transportation infrastructure expenditure varying greatly as a function of the country's existing transportation infrastructure and the reliance of specific economic sectors on transportation in each nation.

Based on the analysis of one type of functional linkage a region can appear to be integrated, but loosely connected based on another. We demonstrate the occurrence of multiplexity for the polycentric Dutch Randstad region, and focus particularly on the presence of individual level heterogeneity. Commuting patterns in the Randstad are strongly related to socio-demographic variables and firm characteristics largely determine the scale of buyer-supplier relationships. We present studies into functional coherence in the Randstad, and assess whether methods, including the interlocking network model, are sufficiently capable of accounting for multiplexity and individual level heterogeneity.","[Burger, Martijn J.] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Tinbergen Inst, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Burger, Martijn J.] ERIM, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Meijers, Evert J.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Van Oort, Frank G.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Delft University of Technology; Utrecht University,"Meijers, EJ (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",mburger@ese.eur.nl; e.j.meijers@tudelft.nl; f.g.vanoort@uu.nl,"Meijers, Evert/C-2143-2012; Meijers, Evert/AAW-1909-2021; Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020","Meijers, Evert/0000-0002-0031-6828; Meijers, Evert/0000-0002-0031-6828; Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X",,,,,58,34,36,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

These transactions are executed outside the continuous trading system and single price system, and involve trading of large volumes of shares at an agreed price. This paper investigates the information content of equity block trade transactions for companies constituting the WIG20 index from the Warsaw Stock Exchange in Poland. Two research methods are used: literature review and event study analysis. In the empirical part of the paper two approaches are used to model shares' returns: simple linear regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines. From the conducted research it is concluded that equity block trade transactions carry an important signal for investors acting on a stock exchange: significant abnormal positive (negative) returns follow the execution of the equity block trade, the price of which is higher (lower) than the closing price 2 days before the execution of the transaction.

Then an econometric approach is taken using empirical data for production and costs from 2007 to 2009 in order to derive long-run marginal costs for passengers and air traffic movements at Norwegian airports using panel data analysis. The marginal costs are then applied as the basis for a revised airport charge scheme designed to meet the principle of maximizing social benefits. The results suggest that there should be a shift towards a relatively higher charge for passengers compared to air traffic movements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"[Mathisen, T.

Durables also affect bequests and thus induce intergenerational transfers. We show that allowing explicitly for durables has important implications for retirement decisions and responses to various changes in the environment. An improvement in the possibility of freeing housing capital makes the old retire earlier (income effect) while the young plan to retire later since they increase housing demand and reduce financial savings. Considering welfare in stationary equilibrium, we find that a reduction in wealth locking-in in durables is not necessarily welfare improving due to the effects on bequests. From a social welfare perspective, individuals tend to choose too much financial savings, too little durable acquisition and too early retirement.","[Andersen, Torben M.; Hermansen, Mikkel Norlem] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Hermansen, MN (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk; norlemhermansen@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,2,3,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

It relies on the bounce-back effects which were first analyzed in a Markov-Switching setup by Kim, Morley, and Piger (2005), and were recently extended by Bec, Bouabdallah, and Ferrara (2011). This approach is then applied to the post-1973 quarterly growth rates of French, German, Italian, Spanish and Euro area real GDPs. Both the linear autoregression and the standard SETAR without the bounce-back effect null hypotheses are strongly rejected against the Bounce-Back augmented SETAR alternative in all cases but Italy. The relevance of our proposed model is further assessed by a comparison of its short-term forecasting performances with those obtained from a linear autoregression and a standard SETAR. It turns out that the bounce-back model's one-step-ahead forecasts generally outperform the other ones, particularly during the last recovery period in 2009Q3-2010Q4.

As a practice, urban agriculture is beneficial in both post-industrial and developing cities because it touches on the three pillars of sustainability: economics, society, and the environment. Historically, as well as currently, economic and food security are two of the most common reasons for participation in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture not only provides a source of healthful sustenance that might otherwise be lacking, it can also contribute to a household's income, offset food expenditures, and create jobs. Social facets are another reason for populations to engage in urban agriculture. A garden or rooftop farm is a place where people come together for mutual benefit, often enhancing the common social and cultural identity for city residents. Larger urban farms also participate in community enrichment through job training and other educational programmes, many of which benefit underserved populations. Finally, urban agriculture can play an important role in the environmental sustainability of a city. As a form of green infrastructure, urban farms and community food gardens help reduce urban heat island effects, mitigate urban stormwater impacts and lower the energy embodied in food transportation. This paper will describe a multi-year study undertaken by the Urban Design Laboratory at the Earth Institute to assess the opportunities and challenges associated with the development of urban agriculture in New York City (NYC). The paper will present metrics on potential growing capacity within the City inclusive of both rooftop and land-based options, results from a survey of New York City based urban farmers that gathered information on the challenges and barriers to food production in NYC, with a focus on rooftop farming, and data from an environmental monitoring study on a commercial rooftop farm in Brooklyn. The paper will use the results of the multi-year study to provide insight into the potential role of urban agriculture to creating a more sustainable food system for New York City and cities elsewhere.","[Ackerman, Kubi; Conard, Michael; Culligan, Patricia; Plunz, Richard; Sutto, Maria-Paola; Whittinghill, Leigh] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Culligan, Patricia] Columbia Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Plunz, Richard] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Architecture Planning & Preservat, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Ackerman, K (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,44,144,181,9,389,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

With a Discrete Choice Experiment implemented in Lyon, France, we find evidence that even in this very emotionally charged market, consumer behavior has changed in favor of a better assessment of the different possibilities of services supplied and of their relative prices (e.g., high price elasticities). We also implement simulations in local markets and show that with good consumer information the market power of supposedly dominant firms is far less important than generally believed. Lastly, simulations stress the procompetitive effects of any business setting up a new storing facility.","[Blayac, Thierry] Univ Montpellier I, Rue Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Blayac, Thierry] LAMETA, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Bougette, Patrice] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06189 Nice, France; [Bougette, Patrice] GREDEG CNRS, Nice, France; [Montet, Christian] Univ Montpellier I, Univ Polynesie Francaise, GDI, Punaauia, France; [Montet, Christian] LAMETA, Punaauia, France",Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Blayac, T (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier I, Rue Raymond Dugrand,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",blayac@lameta.univ-montp1.fr; patrice.bougette@gredeg.cnrs.fr; christian.montet@upf.pf,,"Bougette, Patrice/0000-0003-3108-9522",,,,,18,1,1,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

First, the cost of reconstructing all existing Interstate lane-miles is estimated, using FHWA HERS unit cost data. The cost of adding lanes, where indicated by projected growth in light and heavy vehicle travel, is estimated using HERS unit costs. The revenue that could be generated by an inflation-adjusted per-mile tolling system (to be implemented via all-electronic tolling) on this rebuilt and modernized system is estimated. Finally, the net present value of toll revenues is compared with the net present value of modernization cost as an initial estimate of financial feasibility.

The data available consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity loads for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the locations of either the zones or stations. We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand.

The government invests in public health, and an individual's survival probability at the end of youth depends on health expenditure. We show that multiple development regimes can exist. However, poverty or prosperity does not necessarily depend on the initial conditions, since they are the result of how a child policy is designed. A child tax, for example, can be used effectively to enable those economies that were entrapped in poverty to prosper. There is also a long-term welfare-maximising level of the child tax. We show that a child tax can be used to increase capital accumulation, escape from poverty and maximise long-term welfare also when (a) a public pay-as-you-go pension system is in place and (b) the government issues an amount of public debt. Interestingly, there also exists a couple child tax-health tax that can be used to find the second-best optimum optimorum. In addition, we show that results are robust to the inclusion of decisions regarding the child quantity-quality trade-off under the assumption of impure altruism. In particular, there exists a threshold value of the child tax below (resp. above) which child quality spending is unaffordable (resp. affordable) and different scenarios are in existence.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Gori, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Law, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",University of Pisa; University of Genoa,"Gori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Law, Via Balbi 30-19, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; luca.gori@unige.it,,"Gori, Luca/0000-0003-1967-0840",,,,,92,22,22,1,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Seldom is participation viewed as a means to legitimate disruptive practices of states. However, participation can become a tool for the effective implementation of policy rather than a means to enhance justice, if no power is transferred to citizens. Displacement in Amsterdam is a case in point. Here the local council together with housing corporations yearly forces over 2,000 households to leave their houses, a consequence of an ambitious policy of state-led gentrification. Following Foucault, I explore the rationalities and techniques employed to ensure compliance. The promise of influence lures tenants into lengthy discussions with power holders. Investment choices are presented as objective facts and so provide a rationale for the disruptive interventions. Participation thus provides government a platform to impose its views in a context of severe power asymmetries, while alternatives are marginalised and dissent is disciplined.","[Huisman, Carla] Univ Amsterdam, Grad Sch Social Sci, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huisman, Carla] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Groningen,"Huisman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Grad Sch Social Sci, Kloveniersburgwal 48, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",carlahuisman@soweto.nl,,"Huisman, Carla Jacqueline/0000-0002-4399-0126",,,,,51,20,22,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Yet, pedestrians are a vulnerable group of people and safety concerns are a significant barrier in one's decision to walk. Multiple signal related pedestrian countermeasures have been proposed to promote pedestrian safety. Although the safety impacts of individual strategies have been investigated, their relative effectiveness is little known. Furthermore, those effective in reducing pedestrian crashes may be at odds with motorist safety. Purpose: In this study, we evaluate the relative effectiveness of four signal related pedestrian countermeasures in New York City - increasing the total cycle length, Barnes Dance, split phase timing, and signal installation - and examine potential trade-offs in their reducing pedestrian crashes and multiple vehicle crashes. Methods: We adopted a rigorous two-stage design that first identifies a comparison group, corresponding to each treatment group, and then estimates a negative binomial model with the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method to further control confounding factors and within-subject correlation. Built environment characteristics are also accounted for. Results: Set in a large urban area, this study shows trade-offs between improving pedestrian safety and motorist safety. The study finds that two of them - split phase timing and signal installation - are effective in reducing multiple vehicle crashes. Increasing total cycle length is most effective in promoting pedestrian safety, but its effect on motorist safety is insignificant. Among the four examined, Barnes Dance is the second most effective countermeasure in reducing pedestrian crashes and yet, it tends to increase multiple vehicle crashes, though the effect is insignificant. Takeaway for practice: The findings indicate that selection and implementation of countermeasures for urban intersections should consider the types of conflicts and balance the time for different groups of road users at the intersections so that the countermeasure is targeted to the problem and the improvement of the safety of one group does not compromise the safety of other groups. It is suggested that increasing cycle length be implemented at intersections with wide streets and areas where there is a higher percentage of elderly pedestrians; Barnes Dance is best installed at areas with many pedestrians and a modest amount of traffic; split phase timing is most desirable for locations with turning movements and relatively narrow streets; and installation of new signals depends largely on the volume of pedestrian and vehicle traffic at the intersections as warranted by MUTCD.

Prior theory recognizes that the effects of national revenues on sub-national revenue-raising are ambiguous. Earlier studies have focused on vertical relationships between particular tax bases, such as the impact of federal commodity taxes on state or provincial commodity tax rates. Using a panel of data from U.S. states over the recent decade, I find an economically and statistically significant degree of federal crowding in of state revenues. Also, employing a difference-in-differences design to study the impact of a 2004 change in the federal deductibility of state general sales taxes, I find modest evidence that deductibility increased state revenues in states more dependent on the sales tax. I note the potential implications of these results for fiscal federalism theory and legal controversies over federal conditional spending. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study was aimed at determining pedestrians' preferences of environmental and infrastructural attributes of crosswalks in order to improve the utility of the facilities and mode by promoting elements preferred by the majority of pedestrians. The survey involved interviewing pedestrians and the results indicated that the majority prefer to cross on level ground and medians, with females and younger pedestrians more willing to use non-level crossings. The most preferred viable options for controlling vehicles' speed and the crosswalk were humps on either side of the crossing and the use of signals (especially on higher class roads), respectively. The majority considered safety to be the most desirable improvement with females and those on utilitarian trips most in support. Also, pedestrians' preference of attributes in relation to different road classes highly agrees with current design principles. It was found that gender, age of pedestrian, purpose of trip and road class affect pedestrian preference and if considered in the planning and design of crossing facilities, they can result in improved safety, convenience and use of this Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) mode.

The Maryland Department of Transportation defines TOD as a place of relatively higher density that includes a mixture of residential, employment, shopping and civic uses and types located within an easy walk of a bus or rail transit center( Transit-Oriented Development Task Force, Maryland Department of Transportation, 2000). TOD is a fast-growing development strategy and is becoming more popular among city planners, land developers, and government officials for its potential to increase transit ridership and reduce VMT by shortening trips. However, there has not been enough research done on how successful TODs are in providing sustainable transportation modes, which will eventually result in less energy consumption, environmental pollution, and traffic congestion in urban areas. The present study tries to understand how travel behavior is different for TOD residents in the two metropolitan areas of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. This is done specifically by examining the changes in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in order to analyze the effectiveness of TODs on encouraging driving less and switching to transit, walking, biking, and other sustainable modes of transportation. The question of can transit-oriented development (TOD) reduce vehicle miles of travel? has been asked frequently, since TODswerefirst proposed and implemented in urban areas. This paper tries to find a viable answer to this question by analyzing the VMT of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore residents. Our results indicate that people living in TOD areas tend to drive less, reducing theirVMT by around 38% in Washington, D.C. and 21% in Baltimore, compared to the residents of the non-TOD areas even with similar land use patterns.

Work-related travel has a significant impact on both road and occupational safety. Implementing a long term, sustainable work-related road safety program is a complex process requiring careful management decision making. Despite an increasing interest in research, policy and practice, there remain few published studies of organisations that have effectively managed their travel risks. The aim of this paper is to review and evaluate the outcomes of a driver risk assessment, monitoring and improvement program undertaken by British Telecommunications throughout its UK operations. The material presented is based on a detailed case study of the policies, procedures and performance monitoring implemented to manage the road safety risks of approximately 95,000 workers over more than 10 years. From a review of processes and outcomes, a good practice data-led systems-based approach is identified, focusing on occupational health and safety principles, the Haddon Matrix, risk assessment and evaluation. The case, which has seen a halving of the company's collision rate and costs, provides access to large insurance claims and other data sets over a long term period. A number of potential lessons for researchers, policy makers and practitioners are identified relating to issues such as data, management, tools, frameworks and further opportunities to focus on improving both road and worker safety.

Several assessments of the theory have shown that tolerance and creativity cannot be ignored. However, as the focus in these assessments mainly has been to replicate the results of Richard Florida, they have put less emphasis on the issues the tolerance measures pose. This paper argues that tolerance has only been measured by diverse population and that this is insufficient. To solve this issue a variety of tolerance measures are introduced and underlying effects of other variables are tested for. Surprisingly, the only measure significant in the model is the bohemian measure. On the one hand, this renders support for the creative capital theory and suggests that attracting bohemian employees can gain economic growth. On the other hand, it problematises the tolerance concept and indicates that tolerance is hard to grasp and add to economic models.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Wimark, T (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Human Geog, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",thomas.wimark@humangeo.su.se,,"Wimark, Thomas/0000-0001-7272-1729",,,,,54,5,5,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

At first glance it may seem that if the overall economic development of the country, in which the individual lives, is good it also ensures growing trend in quality of life.

The article defines the BSC concept and its important shift from the basic system for measuring the performance of the BSC as a strategic tool for measuring and managing business and management performance. There are also analyzed the results of the empirical findings of foreign studies that examined the relationship between the use of BSC and financial performance of companies. An extensive questionnaire survey carried out by the Faculty of Management and Economics of TBU in Zlin (a total of 350 enterprises in the Czech Republic) revealed that the BSC is used by approximately 13% of enterprises. A company's size affects the use of BSC, which was confirmed by chi-square, and therefore we can state that the use of BSC grows with a company's size. Although the use of BSC in manufacturing and service-based businesses is higher than in trading companies, the use of the chi-square did not confirm the impact of company specialization on the use of BSC. The BSC concept is also more frequently used in companies established before 1990 than in those founded later, but not even in this case did the use of the chi-square verified the impact of company age on the use of BSC. It was also tested whether the use of BSC in corporate practice improves the financial performance of companies. As financial performance indicators were selected return on equity and return on assets. The testing was carried out by using Wilcoxon test. Although enterprises using the BSC are reaching higher mean profitability, the differences in the achieved performance can not be due to the results considered significant. The results are consistent with the results achieved by lttner et al. [22], and Griffith and Neely [15]. Different conclusions were then drawn by studies done by the following authors (Hogue and James, [16], Davis, Albright [8], Braam, Nijsen [6], Crabtree, DeBusk [7], DeGeuser, Mooraj, Oyon [9], which show that the concept of BSC use in the system for performance measurement and management is associated with higher performance. Using the Wilcoxon test, it was found that neither the level of satisfaction with the use of BSC has any effect on the financial performance of companies. There are specified benefits and limitations of this study in conclusion.","[Knapkova, Adriana; Pavelkova, Drahomira] Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu & Ekon, Ustav Financi & Ucetnictvi, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Homolka, Lubor] Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu & Ekon, Ustav Stat & Kvantitativnich Metod, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Knápková, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tomase Bati Zline, Fak Managementu & Ekon, Ustav Financi & Ucetnictvi, Zlin, Czech Republic.",knapkova@fame.utb.cz; homolka@fame.utb.cz; pavelkova@fame.utb.cz,"Homolka, Lubor/P-7714-2019; Nguyen, Ninh/GQH-2311-2022","Homolka, Lubor/0000-0002-6628-8241; Nguyen, Ninh/0000-0002-7375-8408; Pavelkova, Drahomira/0000-0003-1399-6129",,,,,48,16,16,1,36,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The prominent characteristic of the operators is that they cannot only consider the importance of the elements or their ordered positions, but also reflect the correlation among the elements or their ordered positions. We have studied some desirable properties of these operators, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity, and applied these operators to multiple attribute decision making with triangular fuzzy linguistic information.

Three options were given: a lower contribution rate, a higher contribution rate with governmental subsidy, and the exit from the second pillar system. The aim of this article is to evaluate the best rational choice for individuals of different gender and age, depending on the expected financial returns of their second pillar accounts. Results reveal that participation in the second pillar system is always more convenient than the abandonment, even under the conservative hypothesis of zero real rate of return. Because of the governmental subsidy, the higher contribution rate can be the best choice for young and middle-aged workers, and its convenience increases with higher expected returns. The higher contribution seems to offer favourable returns to Lithuanian workers, also when compared with similar estimates for pension systems in other countries.","[Maccioni, Alessandro Fiori] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ & Business DISEA, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Gudaitis, Tadas] Vilnius State Univ, Fac Econ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Sassari; Vilnius University,"Maccioni, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Econ & Business DISEA, Via Muroni 25, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",alex.fiori.maccioni@gmail.com; tadas.gudaitis@ef.vu.lt,,"Gudaitis, Tadas/0000-0002-2275-1388; Fiori Maccioni, Alessandro/0000-0002-2080-7405",,,,,38,2,2,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This means that rural to urban migrants are less likely than locals to be found in formal employment and more likely to be found in informal employment and among the unemployed. Using perspectives from Development Economics we explore the South African National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) panel datasets of 2008 and 2010, which only provide a perspective on what has happened between 2008 and 2010. We find that while migrants in general experience positive outcomes in informal labour markets, they also experience positive outcomes in formal markets, which is contrary to expectations. We also find that there are strong links between other indicators of performance in the labour market. Earned incomes are closely associated with migration decisions and educational qualifications (e.g. a matric certificate) for respondents between the ages of 30 and 60 years. The youth (15 to 30 years old) and senior respondents (over the age of 60) are the most disadvantaged in the labour market. The disadvantage is further reflected in lower earned incomes. This is the case even though the youth are most likely to migrate. We conclude that migration is motivated by both push (to seek employment) and pull (existing networks or marriage at destination) factors. For public policy, the emerging patterns - indicative and established - are important for informing strategies aimed at creating employment and developing skills for the unemployed, migrants and especially the youth. Similar policy strategies are embodied in the National Development Plan (NDP), the National Skills Development Strategy (NSDS), etc.","[Mbatha, Cyril N.] Univ S Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Mbatha, CN (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Grad Sch Business Leadership, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,42,5,6,0,12,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The recent Global Financial Crisis and the following European debt crisis show the significance of the country financial stability, consequently the efficiency of fiscal and monetary policies, and their impact on the private sector. The macroeconomic policies of a country affect the financial performances of the companies and their future sustainable development and growth. We analyze the influence of external determinants on the corporate capital structure of non-financial manufactured companies based on the evidence from European developed countries and emerging markets for the period 2006-2010, in order to compare the level of the impact on the capital structure according to the countries' specifics. The managers make their financial decisions according to the source of financing and capital structure based on the company's advantages and disadvantages, i.e. its internal characteristics, and doubtless on the macroeconomic conditions and country specifics, i.e. external factors. For the purpose of this study the macroeconomic factors are divided into two groups represented fiscal and monetary policies of a country. The correlation and regression techniques are used to identify the relations between these external determinants and capital structure.

This enormous amount of money obtained by perpetrators should be used in the legal way in the worldwide economy. The main problem is that, the money originated in illegal activities is not welcome in the legal economy. That is the reason this money should be undergo a recycling process. The money laundering is the process of creating the appearance that black money obtained from serious crimes, such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings or terrorist activity, are originated from a legal sources, after a complex recycling process. This criminal process by which money could be laundered is extensive and hundreds of billions of US dollars is yearly laundered through financial institutions. In the contemporary financial and banking world, money laundering could be understood only by analyzing it in correlation with global financial transactions and huge capital investments occurring in the world economy today. Contemporary world market includes daily transactions of about hundred billions of UD dollars, of which, paradoxically, only a small fraction (about 10%) is related to world trade. Most of the transactions taking place in the global market are the result of contemporary financial speculation and short-term investments often under the cover of anonymity. That's why one of the objectives of the Law Enforcement Bodies is to discover and punish individuals and organizations involved in assisting criminals to benefit from the proceeds of their criminal activity or to facilitate providing financial services to them. By volume of recycled money, money laundering can affect a country financial, economic, social and even political.

Based on a large sample of small firms and their owners, this study provides insights into what determines small firm financing and innovativeness.

Using annual reports of 152 non-financial listed companies in Vietnam in 2007, the study finds that factors influencing the extent of voluntary disclosure of Vietnamese listed companies are internal audit committee, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, firm size and external auditor type. The state-owned attribute, one of the specialties of Vietnamese corporates, does not affect to voluntary disclosure along with non-executive, dual leadership structure, ownership concentration, leverage, profitability and liquidity characteristics. The result could be considered as a reference source for shareholders, managers, creditors, regulators and those who are concerned about upgrading quality of Vietnamese corporate annual reports to improve the market transparency to help investors make a good and timely decision basing on the accurate and up-to-date data sources.","[Thong Tien Nguyen] HCMC Univ Technol, Sch Ind Management, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,,551017019@stu.hcmut.edu.vn,"Nguyen, Huy/AAF-9560-2019","Nguyen, Huy/0000-0002-5896-9661",,,,,32,0,0,0,12,EURASIAN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS SOC,ISTANBUL,"AKSEMSETTIN MAH KOCASINAN CAD NO 8-4, ISTANBUL, FATIH 34080, TURKEY",,,978-605-64002-7-8,,,,2014,,,,,,,172,188,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB2XI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000342457200013,0

A positive relationship between the CSR activities of SMEs and their enhanced competitiveness exists, at least if a long-term perspective is adopted (European Competitiveness Report, 2008:106; Mandl & Dorr, 2007:2). Despite the widespread practical and academic interest in CSR and its impact on the competitiveness of SMEs, few theoretical and empirical contributions could be found. The primary objective of this study was to identify and empirically test the CSR factors influencing the competitiveness of SMEs in Uganda. The outcomes of this study will assist SMEs to effectively and responsibly manage their activities to increase their competitiveness. A structured, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 750 potential SME respondents. The respondents were identified by means of a purposive sampling technique, and the data were collected from 383 usable questionnaires. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients calculated to determine the discriminant validity and reliability of the measuring instrument. Correlations were assessed using structural equation modeling. The empirical results of this study indicate that workforce-oriented CSR activities, society-oriented CSR activities, market-oriented CSR activities and regulated CSR activities significantly influence the competitiveness of SMEs.","[Turyakira, Peter] Makerere Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, Kampala, Uganda; [Venter, Elmarie; Smith, Elroy] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Business Management, Eastern Cape, South Africa",Makerere University; Nelson Mandela University,"Turyakira, P (通讯作者)，Makerere Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, Kampala, Uganda.",,"YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/F-1270-2019","YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/0000-0001-5240-1023",,,,,66,55,67,3,90,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Previous studies have shown that a small proportion of students are founding their enterprises before graduation and those enterprises are relatively small, primarily micro-enterprises with a modest turn-over (Fueglistaller et al., 2009). The purpose of this article is to study students' entrepreneurship in Estonia based on the information of international survey GUESSS (Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey), undertaken in 2011. The comparison of the experience of Estonian students with other European countries (e.g. Hungary, Finland) will be included. The research questions answered in this study are: 1) how is venture creation process organized by students, 2) how does university support students' entrepreneurship. The conceptual framework for describing the process of new venture creation is based on Cartner (1985) that integrates four major perspectives in entrepreneurship: the characteristics of the individual(s) starting the new venture; the organization they create; the environment surrounding the new venture; and the process by which the new venture is created. The methods of linear statistical analysis are utilized with the help of the computation package SPSS 20.0. The contribution of the paper is to improve our understanding of factors influencing students' venture creation process and how the environment in universities should be developed for activating students' entrepreneurship.

Among other things, it is associated with rising household indebtedness, which has certainly been true in Canada. Another widely recognized trait of neoliberal capitalism is growing social inequality and polarization. However, despite growing awareness and understanding of the relationships between debt and inequality at the household, national, and international scales, it remains unclear what role household debt may have in fashioning patterns of income segregation within the metropolis and how it may be related to processes of urban economic restructuring. This article seeks to fill this gap through an empirical analysis of the spatial distribution of household debt and its relationship to prevailing patterns of neighborhood income inequality within Canadian metropolitan areas. The effects of household debt in either ameliorating or exacerbating prevailing levels of income segregation are analyzed, after which the metropolitan-level factors that are associated with regressive neighborhood distributions of debt are examined. The implications of the results for understanding the relationship between financialization and predominant patterns of urban economic restructuring are then discussed.","Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Walks, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",alan.walks@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,144,25,30,1,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Our work benefits from recent developments in the dynamic factor literature related to the extraction of the common factors from a large panel of macroeconomic series and the estimation of the parameters in the model. We include these factors in a dynamic factor model for the yield curve, in which we model the salient structure of the yield curve by imposing smoothness restrictions on the yield factor loadings via cubic spline functions. We carry out a likelihood-based analysis in which we jointly consider a factor model for the yield curve, a factor model for the macroeconomic series, and their dynamic interactions with the latent dynamic factors. We illustrate the methodology by forecasting the U.S. term structure of interest rates. For this empirical study, we use a monthly time series panel of unsmoothed Fama-Bliss zero yields for treasuries of different maturities between 1970 and 2009, which we combine with a macro panel of 110 series over the same sample period. We show that the relationship between the macroeconomic factors and the yield curve data has an intuitive interpretation, and that there is interdependence between the yield and macroeconomic factors. Finally, we perform an extensive out-of-sample forecasting study. Our main conclusion is that macroeconomic variables can lead to more accurate yield curve forecasts.

Energy costs are becoming an increasing threat to the long-term survival of firms because of their more volatile nature. The distinct geographic structure of energy prices combines both international markets and intranational policies and supply structures. It is vital to understand how firms manage the risk that is generated from such a complex input. This article explores the adjustment process of intermediate metal-processing firms in the West Midlands U.K. and their wider supply chain to the energy price risk and its interaction with existing long-term adjustments to the pressure of globalization. Formal and informal relational agreements between customers and suppliers are identified as critical factors in determining the capacity of supplier firms to transfer energy price risks to their customers and to adapt to energy-related pressures.","[Mulhall, Rachel Ann; Bryson, John R.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Mulhall, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",r.a.mulhall@bham.ac.uk; j.r.bryson@bham.ac.uk,"Bryson, John/ABE-8229-2020","Bryson, John/0000-0002-6435-8402",,,,,80,7,8,1,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

In this contribution, we focus on the patent activity of Flemish universities (period 1991-2001). In Flanders, university patenting has become explicitly incentivized through policy measures (1996) and more recently even resource allocation schemes are resulting in a notably high share of universities in the overall patent portfolio of the regional innovation system. As a result, one might expect inflationary effects on the level of academic patents, especially in terms of quality. In addition, we analyze whether the impact of academic patents depends on the mode of university involvement (university-invented vs university-owned). Overall, we observe a considerable increase in both types of academic patenting without any deterioration (over time) of citation rates. Moreover, our findings indicate that university-owned patents receive more forward citations than university-invented (firm-owned) patents. Combined, these findings signal that the increase of academic patent activitystimulated by policies granting ownership rights to universitiesdid not coincide with a decrease in their value.","[Callaert, Julie; Du Plessis, Mariette] Katholieke Univ Leuven, INCENTIM ECOOM, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Van Looy, Bart] Univ Twente, Inst Governance Studies, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Van Looy, Bart; Debackere, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Management Strategy & Innovat, INCENTIM ECOOM, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Twente; KU Leuven,"Callaert, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, ECOOM, Waaistraat 6 Bus 3536, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",julie.callaert@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,50,9,9,1,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

While important criticisms of market-based regulation abound, recent research has suggested that this form of politics is not restricted to simple market signals or a singular market logic, so the question of what drives corporate responsiveness remains. Drawing on a statistical analysis of a large data set of marketplace campaigns and in-depth interviews with campaign proponents, consultants, and targeted executives, this article proposes a relational framework for understanding marketplace politics, situating campaign strategies in relation to targeted firms' brand vulnerabilities and corporate social responsibility (CSR) absorptive capacity, on the one hand, and parallel actions of key intermediariesincluding investment advisory firms and pioneering competitorson the other hand. I argue that it is influential minorities of consumers, investors, and intermediariesoften in dialogue with targeted executiveswho create change, rather than majority, arm's length market movements.

In total, 10,374 time series realizations are contrasted against competing short-, medium- and longer-term purely autoregressive and adjusted predictors.

The procedure is applied in order to obtain an aggregate estimation of the above variables at years 2006 and 2015 for countries facing the Mediterranean basin. This geographical area was defined to support a specific analysis of the transhipment hub ports of Gioia Tauro, Taranto and Cagliari. The procedure represents a useful tool for market analysts, who need aggregate estimates of demand variables, and for freight model developers, who need data to validate models.

We model a game between a potentially self-interested regulator enforcing insider trading laws and a trader who may be trading on inside information. We show that equilibrium strategies exist where despite active enforcement all inside information is used. Furthermore, we find that increased disclosure in order to reduce the amount of inside information does not necessarily lead to less insider trading as insiders may more frequently use their information. Increased disclosure decreases the contribution of public enforcement to reducing insider trading. We also show that improvements in the risk analysis system used by the regulator for monitoring purposes may prompt more insider trading. The results yield policy implications, contribute to explaining empirical observations, and suggest possible directions for future empirical research into the relationship between enforcement and the cost of equity.

Owing to this recognition, in recent years there has been a surge of interest among policy makers and practitioners in promoting non-motorized commuting in Ireland. This paper presents an investigative study to explain the non-motorized mode share of commuter journeys in terms of relevant socioeconomic, transportation and household specific factors in five major cities of Ireland. The non-motorized modes were analyzed using the latest available Irish census data (2006). An overall analysis of the entire study region was conducted along with the development of models specific to each city, gender, distance (under and over 5 km) and to the choice between non-motorized modes (walking and cycling) to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants which influence the choice of non-motorized travel mode for commuter journeys. Gender, car ownership and journey distance were revealed by analysis to have the largest effect on the use of non-motorized transport (NMT). Major Irish cities show similar behavior regarding NMT use and nation-wide policy development can be successful, provided some region or city specific differences are incorporated during policy implementation. The developed models are important tools in understanding the effectiveness of the policy interventions in promoting non-motorized travel for utilitarian purposes across the major cities of Ireland.

Moving beyond critiques of varieties literature-for instance, its methodological nationalism; its preoccupation with limited, formal registers of (national) institutional variety; its growing reliance on rational-choice, firm-centric methods; its failure to account for the pronounced interpenetration and mutual dependence of capitalist economies and its tendency to privilege typological elaboration over causal explanation-this article explores the critical (counter?) case of Chinese capitalism.

The approach forces internal consistency between statements of value and preference orderings. We compare the WTP elicited using the new approach to two more simplified elicitation devices by determining sensitivity toan arbitrary anchor and by determining predictive validity relative to a holdout choice. Our results indicate that the imposition of internal consistency yields more stable estimates of WTP; however, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the method provides WTP estimates that lead to a higher degree of predictive validity.","[Kovalsky, Kristen L.; Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Kovalsky, KL (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",kovalsk@ostatemail.okstate.edu; jayson.lusk@okstate.edu,,,,,,,42,12,13,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

In Europe, the ITS Action Plan identifies a number of applications as key elements contributing to the efficient co-ordination of the overall transport chain. The context and experience surrounding the recent widespread development of technological tools and ICT platforms to support the emergence of ITS are notable for the way in which they permeate the transport and logistics chain. But a key question remains: to what extent is the public transport sector able to exploit the wider benefits of ITS? This paper provides a comparative analysis of ITS policy between Europe and Australia. With a focus on the applications and methods adopted in the use of ITS in the public transport sector in Australia the paper critiques their effectiveness in enhancing passenger experience, operator effectiveness and the likely effect on patronage.

The road-pricing study is based on stated preference data, whereas the study involving rewards was conducted in the context of a longitudinal field experiment. Given the substantial differences in data sources and analytical techniques applied beforehand, the comparison is made at an indicative level. It can be cautiously concluded that, as psychological theory predicts, rewarding is more effective in diverting commuters from peak periods. In both cases, the most popular alternative to peak-driving is off-peak driving. Most of the change in behaviour is attributed to introducing the new measure, whereas the impact of different price/reward levels is marginally decreasing in sensitivity and effectiveness. The short-term and long-term policy implications of these findings on the implementation of both measures are further discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The state owned buses are required to serve, not only non-profitable routes in off-peak hours, but also to give social security or employment to a large section of society. The burden of carrying a huge staff structure and serving at an administered and less than competitive price for welfare reasons, makes CSTC liable to an operating loss.

Keeping this aspect in mind the present study has been divided in to two parts. The first part tries to understand the non-motorized traffic evolution in India. It focuses on the declination of non-motorized modes, necessity to revamp it, the favorable conditions to promote them in India and the relative problems associated with it. It is found here that there is a necessity for defining the role of non-motorized modes in India for the viable implementation of infrastructure and policies related with it. The second part consists of two case studies of Bangalore city where the economic benefits are worked out. The first case study provides a framework for monetizing the economic benefits of non-motorized modes. Here the economic benefits of congestion and air pollution reduction, accident and vehicle cost reduction are considered and total savings are worked out. A savings of Indian Rupees (Rs.) 250,000 was found for an assumed 1% shift of travelers to non-motorized mode in a single day. The second one enlists the expected economic benefits associated with pedestrianization of a major arterial called M.G road in Bangalore and estimates a savings of 1611.4 Rs./day due to air pollution and accident reduction. The economic benefits thus found could be used to convince the policy makers and also to form a framework within which decisions can be made regarding non-motorized modes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To test the accuracy of this method of comparison, data about budgets are used to evaluate which factors influence municipality budget expenditures in different years. As influencing factors are tested expenditures in previous years, budget revenue, municipality and parliament elections and others. While assessing data comparison possibilities, calculations are made for full period as well as those periods before and after the reform in such a way analysing variable influence changes and evaluating their strength and stability. Main novelty of this research is elaborated simple, easy to use system for territory comparison in Latvia before and after administrative territorial reform.

In the latter case, it is extremely useful to analyze the entrepreneurs characteristics and the results achieved by their companies, in order to have adequate aid policies tied to the creation of companies according to their real needs. This knowledge is currently needed even more, given the growing participation of women as entrepreneurs and the development of new economic, social and regional policies that tend to promote female entrepreneurial activity. The analysis, focusing on gender, is part of the result of a survey conducted in 2009, with two hundred fifty-one (251) answers from a sample of female Spanish entrepreneurs and three hundred fifty-seven (357) answers from a representative sample of the entire Spanish business community. On the other hand, statistical techniques used in the analysis of the questionnaires search for evidence of female entrepreneurial activity tied to a business strategy based on market opportunities or the development of product policies / innovative processes generated by competitive advantages. In particular, we emphasize the technological effort and the existence of cooperation agreements in the field of innovation with companies and other agents. We take into consideration variables such as demographic, sectorial, psychological, environmental, organizational and the influence of public policies. The characteristics of female entrepreneurs, that are deduced from the analysis, recommends a major effort and action balanced by public institutions in order to involve the entrepreneurial women in innovative activities that reinforce the global competitive environment (policies of stimulation of I+D+i, of technological cooperation, product design, reinforcement of sectorial and territorial clusters etc.) and favour the establishment of entrepreneurial women, creative and Schumpeterian, indispensable to the progress of the entrepreneurial fabric and the national economy.","[Crecente Romero, Fernando; del Val Nunez, Teresa; Mella, Zoi] Univ Alcala de Henares, E-28801 Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,,mteresa.val@uah.es,"Val Núñez, María Teresa/AAB-2361-2019; Romero, Fernando FCR Crecente/H-9547-2015; Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023","Val Núñez, María Teresa/0000-0001-6008-7935; Romero, Fernando FCR Crecente/0000-0001-5728-1059;",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,155,167,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100016,0

In all six Eastern European countries, the state financed and state organized health system was transformed into a public health insurance scheme, though the implementation thereof differs from country to country. The country-specific information was obtained from a health policy questionnaire that includes both qualitative and quantitative information and covers health financing, purchasing, and provision of services. The compulsory health insurance secures that population has access to mental health services irrespective of their ability to pay. It seems that there is a problem to achieve such universal access in Bulgaria and the Republic of Moldova. The countries spend lower shares of GDP on total health expenditure and from this amount they spent lower shares of total health expenditure on mental health services than Western European countries. The political, social and economic transition in the 1990s initiated the process of mental health policy formulation, adoption of mental health legislation stressing human rights of patients, and a call for a pragmatic balance of community and hospital services. However, not all of this has been successfully realized. Mental health services are underfinanced. Insufficient financing of mental health services leads to absence of financial resources for mental health system development. There were poor investments in mental health services in the past, which led to the situation with a need of renovation of inpatient facilities, and need of improvement of the living conditions in the existing institutions. On the other hand, the national mental health systems need resources for strengthening weak community services. But such additional resources are not available.","[Dlouhy, Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bartak, Miroslav] JE Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Dlouhy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",dlouhy@vse.cz; miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz,"Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017; Dlouhy, Martin/I-3913-2018","Dlouhy, Martin/0000-0003-1028-1822",,,,,11,16,16,0,26,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Following Page (1997, pp. 67-122, 2001) and others, we use as turning point of the evolution of both aggregate and discrete approaches the DRAG-1 model of 1984, itself based on aggregate data, which introduced four key innovations in principle applicable to both streams. The DRAG approach (i) decomposed losses (victims or damages) into a product of exposure, frequency and severity terms and formulated distinct explanations for all such terms; (ii) structured the decomposed problem as a system of simultaneous equations that included not only those three levels but a fourth one designed to explain driver behavior and make it endogenous; (iii) within each of the four principal levels, took into account sub-categories of severity the joint determination of which constituted a complete system of demand that brought numerous substitutions and complementarities into play; (iv) used for all specified equations flexible mathematical forms of the Box Cox type applied to all regression variables. These forms were decisive in defining statistical correlations (signs included), upon which they themselves depended, and in justifying the initial breakdown into multiple risk dimensions by revealing the mathematical form appropriate for each level (exposure, frequency, and severity) of the decomposition. Using these four critical dimensions, we summarize both aggregate and disaggregate model developments, classifying them notably with respect to number of risk outcome levels addressed, severity categories accounted for, mathematical form of their variables and number of classes of explanatory variables put to contribution. For aggregate models, we document evolution from early ones explaining a single damage category for one region to the latest explaining multiple damage categories for many regions, not forgetting intermediate cases. With respect to the disaggregate models, in addition to providing a classification with respect to the same four dimensions, we raise the specific problems of aggregation from individual to population values without which discrete analysis remains of limited relevance, giving disproportionate attention to the landmark by Bolduc et al., available for the first time in English in this issue.

The proposed method is applied in a real instance and its results are examined.","[Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi; Akrami, Hadi] Inst Trade Studies & Res, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Hashemi, Shide Sadat] Allameh Tabatabaei Univ, Management & Accounting Fac, Tehran, Iran",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Hajiagha, SHR (通讯作者)，Inst Trade Studies & Res, Tehran, Iran.",s.hossein.r@gmail.com; hadi.akrami@gmail.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; shide_hashemi@yahoo.com,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,40,26,26,0,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Such evidence is in contrast to analysts' image in the public mind as gatekeepers of the capital markets. This paper addresses the contentious question regarding analysts' performances in forecasting the future earnings of intangible firms. The assessment is relative to extrapolative time series models. The paper's results show that the forecast errors produced by both analysts and extrapolative models are positively associated with intangibles that are above the industry norm, which is consistent with the difficulty of processing complex intangible information. However, the impact of intangibles on forecast errors is stronger for the forecasts of extrapolative models than for those of analysts. Analysts' superiority is positively associated with firms' specific intangibles, and this association increases as the complexity of the intangible information increases. This finding is consistent with analysts' better ability to forecast the earnings of intangible firms, relative to extrapolative models. (C) 2012 International Institute of Forecasters.

Aim of the studies is, based on the on information available in databases, to evaluate changes in Gini coefficient in Latvia, and, based on calculations of the author (with example being Latvia) to prove the disadvantages of using it - it's systematically reducing in bigger territories. Gini coefficient (index) is generally statistical indicator. In year 2012 it was 100 years since for the first time (in 1912) the formula of Gini coefficient was published, together with its Italian authors Corrado Gini's ideas about usage of it. It can be calculated for different indicators wherever it is needed to numerically compare the inequality of distribution. Most commonly it is used in statistics of measuring quality of life. It is relative indicator, derived from average level of income. It describes the relative, not aboslute risk of poverty within population. Gini coefficient is 0, if all of population is having same level of income. The more this indicator is closing to 1, the bigger is inequality of income. Gini coefficient is expressed also as percentage. The newest comparable data for EU countries are available for year 2010. Within EU countries the average Gini index was 30.7 pct. The highest value of Gini was for Latvia (35.2), but the lowest - for Ireland (23.6). (EUROSTAT Database) In Latvia the Gini index is being measured since 2004 (36.1). The biggest inequality was in year 2005 - 39.2, but the lowest one in 2006 - 35.2 (it can be explained by increase of social tax transfers). Since 2007 the Gini coefficient has been decreasing, from 37.7 till 35.2 in year 2010. When comparing statistical data in regions of Latvia, it can be concluded that in year 2010 the most unequal distribution of income was in Riga - 35.2 and Pieriga - 34.7, but the most equal distribution of income was in Kurzeme - 32.2. (CSB Database) Income of whole household is dependant on the income of most profitable member - is he/she working wage work, has retired, self-employed or has other status. In 2010, 56% of households were working in hired jobs, 29% - households of retired people, 7% - self-employed. Approximately 7% of households consisted of unemployed, where most of income. Main results and findings of paper are: even if Gini coefficient in Latvia has a tendency of reducing, it is still a relative indicator which does not reflect how real consumption expenditure on one household member has lowered over this period of time in all types of households.","[Ozolina, Rita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,,rita.ozolina@lu.lv,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,470,475,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BB5ES,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000343755100043,0

This can translate into adjustments in risk perception by the market agents, which may lead to significant changes in real investment development. We examine the issue of time-varying systematic risk on a micro level using the capital asset pricing model in an intertemporal setting. We formulate the hypothesis within a bivariate GARCH-in-mean model, which enables us to estimate the time-varying variances and covariances of the respective assets and market returns and thus the time-varying sensitivity to systematic risk. The results of the paper show that the reaction of assets' sensitivity to systematic risk varies across the sample and the changes were rather temporary. Based on the results, the downturn in economic activity witnessed in 2008 - 2009 should not be a drag on real investment.","[Posta, Vit; Pikhart, Zdenek] Czech Republ Univ Econ, Minist Finance, Prague 11810, Czech Republic",,"Posta, V (通讯作者)，Czech Republ Univ Econ, Minist Finance, Letenska 15, Prague 11810, Czech Republic.",vit.posta@mfcr.cz; zdenek.pikhart@mfcr.cz,"Pikhart, Zdenek/AAC-5933-2020","Posta, Vit/0000-0001-9919-4519; Pikhart, Zdenek/0000-0002-8176-8200",,,,,38,0,0,0,9,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Turbulence, as disordered and unpredictable mobilities, can be contrasted with smooth laminar flow where everything is moving correctly. This paper borrows from the philosophies of Michel Serres and Manuel DeLanda to think about turbulence as a process which makes visible the always-contingent orderings of infrastructural mobilities. The paper is illustrated with examples from container shipping and, particularly, the grounding of the MSC Napoli container ship off the coast of Southern England. Turbulent mobilities are contrasted with the smooth operation of infrastructural mobilities that are supposed to remain silent and invisible. The dramatic and very visible instances of turbulence, that no system can ever predict or make disappear, provide an entry point into the ordering of a mobile world.","[Cresswell, Tim; Martin, Craig] Univ London, Dept Geog, London, England",University of London,"Cresswell, T (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Geog, London, England.",tim.cresswell@rhul.ac.uk; craigjmartin@virgin.net,"Cresswell, Timothy/F-8742-2018; Cresswell, Timothy J/N-1303-2013; Cresswell, Timothy/V-9831-2019","Cresswell, Timothy/0000-0002-9450-9339; Cresswell, Timothy/0000-0002-9450-9339",,,,,80,74,75,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This article surveys the literature in order to (1) assess the fitness of the main quantitative methodologies employed and (2) identify the main undeveloped areas and unanswered questions for future research. It suggests that policy evaluation is necessarily an imprecise science and that all existing methodologies have strengths and limitations. The areas where the need is most pressing for further work include: understanding why abuse of dominance cases are only infrequently evaluated; the need to bring conscious discussion of the counterfactual firmly into the foreground; and a wider definition of policy to include success in deterrence and detection. At the heart of the discussion is the impact of selection bias on most aspects of evaluation.,"[Davies, Stephen W.; Ormosi, Peter L.] Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Davies, Stephen W.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Ormosi, Peter L.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia,"Davies, SW (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, ESRC Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",s.w.davies@uea.ac.uk; p.ormosi@uea.ac.uk,"Davies, Stephen/HPD-3182-2023","Ormosi, Peter/0000-0001-6472-6511",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,88,15,15,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The research shows that these factors have different effects on people depending on the stage of change of cycling behaviour these people are in. In particular, the effects vary among people in the early stages of change of cycling behaviour (pre-contemplation and contemplation) and those in the late stages of change (action and maintenance). Importantly, results indicate that addressing physical barriers alone is likely to have little impact on encouraging bicycle commuting. More specifically, the research shows that perceived motivator variables (e.g. low bicycle price, quality of bicycle, cycling training, and direct cycling routes) are strongly associated with bicycle commuting. Physical barriers including weather, absence of safe parking at home and at work, lack of bicycle paths and water showers at work places as well as personal barriers like social status, social (in)security and not feeling comfortable on a bicycle have the most negative influence on bicycle commuting. Policy related interventions like exemption of bicycle import tax, car congestion charges, and guarding bicycles at public places have a strong impact on bicycle use. The study findings provide a clear understanding of the key influencing factors which can serve as an empirical basis for development of more effective targeted measures to encourage modal change.

In this article, I examine the influence of sequential litigation when the loser at trial pays all the litigation costs and compare the results with (a) the situation in which litigation is unitary and the loser pays all the litigation costs and (b) the situation in which litigation is sequential and each party bears her own costs.

The executive's key agents in this conflict are his appointees, who frequently play one of two roles: Congressional allies, where they help Congress implement policy and Congressional adversaries, where they fight with Congress to shift policy strongly toward the executive. This article studies how these two roles arise and what implications they have for administrative policymaking. It highlights how intrinsically motivated bureaucrats combined with hierarchical control affect the ability of the political principals to control the execution of policy. I explore how this interaction shifts under alternative institutional forms, and how it leads appointees to go native. The model makes several predictions concerning Congressional oversight of bureaucratic agencies. An empirical analysis of audit reports released by the Government Accountability Office finds patterns of oversight consistent with these predictions.","Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University,"Warren, PL (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",patrick.lee.warren@gmail.com,,,,,,,82,9,9,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

First, it considers the case where the parameters of the model are known. The paper analytically shows that neither cointegration nor integration constraint matters in Long-term forecasts. It is an alternative implication of Long-term forecasts for cointegrated processes, extending the results of previous influential studies. The appropriate Mote Carlo experiment supports our analytical result. Secondly, and more importantly, it considers the case where the parameters of the model are estimated. The paper shows that accuracy of the estimation of the drift term is crucial in Long-term forecasts. Namely, the relative accuracy of various Long-term forecasts depends upon the relative magnitude of variances of estimators of the drift term. It further experimentally shows that in finite samples the univariate ARIMA forecast, whose drift term is estimated by the simple time average of differenced data, is better than the cointegrated system forecast, whose parameters are estimated by the well-known Johansen's ML method. Based upon finite sample experiments, it recommends the univariate ARIMA forecast rather than the conventional cointegrated system forecast in finite samples for its practical usefulness and robustness against model misspecifications.

The main results are fourfold. First, the predictive likelihood does always better than the traditionally employed marginal likelihood in settings where the true model is not part of the model space. Secondly, forecast accuracy as measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) is maximized for the median probability model. On the other hand, model averaging excels in predicting direction of changes. Lastly, g should be set according to Laud and Ibrahim (1995: Predictive model selection. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B 57: 247262) with a hold-out sample size of 25% to minimize the RMSE (median model) and 75% to optimize direction of change forecasts (model averaging). We finally apply the aforementioned recommendations to forecast the monthly industrial production output of six countries, beating for almost all countries the AR(1) benchmark model.

In this area, the formal policy still in effect today was designed with the participation of multilateral agencies under a system with neoliberal tendencies; nevertheless, political changes begun in 1998 have impelled transformations in the Venezuelan public transportation system. The objective of this article is to identify whether national urban transportation policy contributes to improving access to public transportation service for low-income sectors, contributing thereby to the social inclusion promoted in political change. Methodology consisted of the analysis of official documents, secondary sources and semi-structured interviews with 6 public officials, 3 international urban transportation consultants, 3 transportation union presidents and 3 urban transportation researchers, all actors in the process for forming urban transportation policies. Results reveal that mass transport systems are being constructed in difficult access sectors with an investment of $ 7,856.41 million US dollars, facilitating the mobilization of approximately 3 million passengers per day. Conclusions are that, although the formal policy in effect in Venezuela for urban transport, at its core is still the same policy formulated during the period when the neoliberal model predominated, government actions are focused on constructing mass transport systems that permit social inclusion, since they improve access for low-income sectors.","Univ Zulia, Escuela Ingn Ind, Fac Ingn, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela",,"Joheni, UG (通讯作者)，Univ Zulia, Escuela Ingn Ind, Fac Ingn, Maracaibo 4011, Venezuela.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,5,"UNIV ZULIA, FAC CIENCIAS ECON & SOCIALES SCI",MARACAIBO,"CIUDAD UNIV DR.

Further, equilibrium severance pay does not depend on structures or levels of pre-merger manager compensations. Shareholders are always indifferent between dismissing either of the two managers.

We examine whether the divorce rate is a stationary series, exhibits a unit root, or is stationary around a process subject to structural breaks. A clear finding from this analysis is that not all shocks have transitory effects on the divorce rate. Our results provide evidence of both stationarity around occasional shocks that have permanent effects, and of a unit root, where all shocks have a permanent effect on the divorce rate. All of the permanent shocks are positive, and most are grouped in the 1970s. These shocks can be related to major events that occurred throughout Europe at that time: the divorce law reforms, suggesting that those policies play an important role in the movement of European divorce rates.

Commuting by public transit, in particular, is hypothesized to lead to more overall walking, relative to commuting with a car. A statewide computer assisted telephone survey in New Jersey (n=530) was used to collect information on the mode usually used for the commute, the frequency of walking for all purposes, socio-demographic characteristics and neighborhood indicators of the presence of destinations within a 10 min walk. Ordered probit models of the frequency of walk trips were estimated. Respectively, 63% and 68%, of those commuting by transit and walking or bicycling report walking at least once a day. Public transit commuters walked more frequently for all purposes than car commuters; and almost as frequently as those walking to work. There were significant differences in walking frequency between transit modes (bus vs. train/subway/light rail) and non-significant differences between transit access mode (walking vs. park-and-ride). Working from home was not associated with more frequent walking. The time that a transit user spent walking to transit stations or stops was on average slightly shorter than the time spent walking during a journey to work by walking. Walking more to access neighborhood destinations seemed to account for this higher frequency of walking in transit users. Transit service and neighborhood destinations may be complementary in supporting increased walking activity and transit use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It suggests that the stock market index and the M2/GDP ratio show a positive (negative) relationship if the M2/GDP ratio is less (greater) than the critical value of 43.68%. Hence, to maintain a healthy stock market, the Polish authorities are expected to pursue economic growth, reduce government borrowing, avoid currency appreciation, and keep a relatively low interest rate or a relatively low expected inflation rate.

In both contexts, nature conservation revolves around processes of de-regulation, re-regulation, and territorialisation, facilitating new forms of capitalist expansion. Adapting Bourdieu's arguments and the inter-changeability of different forms of capital, we provide ethnographic insight on how these processes unfold. Our analysis reveals two recent trends in nature-society relations in late capitalism: (1) these processes are less determined by ownership than the ability to render different kinds of capital commensurable with one another; and (2) they depend on specific types of performances, which are encouraged and rewarded by neoliberal forms of environmental governance.","[Neves, Katja] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Igoe, Jim] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",Concordia University - Canada; Dartmouth College,"Neves, K (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",knevesgr@alcor.concordia.ca; james.j.igoe@darmouth.edu,"Neves, Katja/T-1708-2019","Neves, Katja/0000-0001-5044-4943",,,,,67,34,37,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In this article, I investigate the implications of the existence of both conditional cooperators and egoists for optimal law enforcement strategies. When norms of cooperation exist between conditional cooperators, sanctions set by an authority can be lower than in a Hobbesian setting where everybody is egoistic. Moreover, if the authorities have private information about the fraction of egoists in society, low sanctions can be optimal because they signal that there are few defectors and thus crowd in trust and cooperation between agents. In social dilemmas where conditional cooperation is an important factor, as is the case in tax compliance, the model provides a rationale for the low observed sanctions in the real world and the mixed evidence on the effectiveness of deterrence.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"van der Weele, J (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",vdweele@econ.uni-frankfurt.de,,"van der Weele, Joel/0000-0002-1855-9289",,,,,31,20,20,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

Particularly, it analyzes the conditions of an optimal mixed payment in the context of an asymmetry of information. Using a model, we highlight that setting the conditions of payment is an endogenous part of a takeover agreement between the acquirer and the target. Our contribution is to show how, in the acquisition process, the setting of the cash percentage is a key element for conveying private information on the gains of synergy and the gains that result from the transaction. In our model, we internalize asymmetries of information and possible exaggeration biases. Both will influence the joint setting of a mixed payment scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we suggest a framework to examine the relationship between state space models and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models by examining the existence and positive-definiteness conditions implied by auto-covariance structures. This study covers broad types of state space models frequently used in previous studies. We also suggest a simple statistical test to check whether a certain state space model is appropriate for the specific data. For illustration, we apply the suggested procedure in the analysis of the United States real gross domestic product data.
