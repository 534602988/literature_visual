Justifications for the waiver are reduced vehicle-fuel prices and less consumption of petroleum gasoline, leading to greater energy security. Empirical investigations of this waiver using Monte Carlo simulations reveal an anomaly where a relaxation of this blend wall elicits a demand response. Under a wide range of elasticities, this demand response can actually increase the consumption of petroleum gasoline and thus lead to greater energy insecurity. The economics supporting this result and associated policy implications are developed and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In our initial analysis we examine the determinants of banks' willingness to lend to SBs and in the second part we investigate the Granger-causes of diversification towards SB lending and banks' efficiency and ex-post risk. Our results reveal that large banks are less interested in SB lending compared to small banks. Profitability is an important determinant for Indonesian banks to lend to SBs. Islamic banks, however, benefit more from lending to SBs given the substantial improvement in their net interest margin and lower capital compared to conventional banks. Our findings signal overpricing behaviour by Islamic banks, represented by a relatively high unadjusted rate of return given the risk exposure of their products. It is also evident that Islamic banks' managers seem to hold less capital, counting on the benefits of portfolio diversification towards SBs lending. As expected the moral hazard hypothesis is only evident for Islamic banks in terms of loan and income portfolio diversification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper examines a small open economy producing two traded goods with capital, labor, and imported energy. A tariff reduces import and domestic factor income but payment to one domestic factor rises. Energy intensive output falls but the other output may rise in the general equilibrium. Political opinions on the tariff would differ. Revenue is concave in the tariff suggesting that the government might set the tariff to maximize revenue. A simulation illustrates these general equilibrium properties across a range of tariffs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a unique survey, we estimate the unemployment rate at 13.44 percent in 30 provincial capital cities in China in 2007, which is well above the officially announced registered unemployment rate. The discrepancy results from inaccuracy in the calculation of registered unemployment. The discrepancy is not stably evolving across regions or over the years, making it difficult to recover the true unemployment rate using a simple multiplier approach. We further investigate the sources of the discrepancy by examining the determinants of unemployment registration. It is evident that participation in certain public activities, which would facilitate the spread of knowledge related to job-searching and unemployment registration, encouraged unemployment registration. Social attention to government anti-unemployment programs also encouraged unemployment registration. These findings confirm the behavioral hypothesis that incomplete knowledge and limited attention can cause deviation from optimal choice.

In regard to both in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecast, the performance of the Milstein approximation is very close to that of the closed form of the conditional moments. Monte Carlo simulation also shows that the properties of estimators under the Milstein approximation are comparable to those using the closed form of the conditional mean and variance.

The shadow of death effect is treated by assuming a relationship between the propensity to exit and both the contemporaneous and lagged values of efficiency and sunk costs. To estimate the unobserved productive efficiency, we use the Ackerberg et al. (2006) estimator extended by the addition of a correction for selection bias. We use an unbalanced sample of approximately 100 000 French firms over the period 1997 to 2002. Our results indicate that the probability of exit is negatively affected by unobserved individual efficiency and the level of sunk costs. The shadow of death effect applies mainly in manufacturing, where both productive efficiency and sunk costs decrease during several years before exit. In service sectors, the exit process seems to occur more suddenly.","[Blanchard, Pierre; Huiban, Jean-Pierre; Mathieu, Claude] Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, UPEC, F-94100 Creteil, France; [Huiban, Jean-Pierre] INRA, UR ALISS 1303, F-94205 Ivry, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Mathieu, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, UPEC, F-94100 Creteil, France.",claude.mathieu@u-pec.fr,,,,,,,36,10,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Moreover, workers with relatively less safe jobs must get positive transfers whenever labor supply is not very reactive to wages, a condition in line with the findings of a large empirical literature. In these instances, compensating wage differentials equalizing the utilities of ex-ante identical workers in different jobs undermine ex-ante efficiency. Moreover, competitive equilibria where only assets with deterministic payoffs are traded are not first-best.

This paper examines the revenue structure of National Football League and proposes policy recommendations regarding talent distribution among the teams. By using a unique, rich data set on game day stadium attendance and TV ratings we are able to measure the total demand as a function of involved teams' talent levels. Reduced form regression results indicate that TV viewers are more interested in close games, on the other hand stadium attendees are more interested in home team's dominance, in other words stadium demand and TV demand work against each other.

Falling interest rates might induce investment into risky activities. This paper provides evidence on the link between monetary policy and bank risk taking. We use a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model (FAVAR) for the US for the period 1997-2008. Besides standard macroeconomic indicators, we include factors summarizing information provided in the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL). These data provide information on banks' new loans as well as interest rates for different loan risk categories and different banking groups. We identify a risk-taking channel of monetary policy by distinguishing responses to monetary policy shocks across different types of banks and different loan risk categories. Following an expansionary monetary policy shock, small domestic banks increase their exposure to risk. Large domestic banks do not change their risk exposure. Foreign banks take on more risk only in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were 'too low for too long'. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The open economy trilemma is an important issue for the countries in Asia not least because their financial systems are small and exchange rate stability is crucial to their economic growth. This paper investigates whether the economies in Asia are still bound by the impossible trinity by examining the interest rate transmission from the US to the region before and after the onset of the global financial crisis. We make a distinction between long-run versus short-run transmission of interest rates by conducting the Peseran bounds test of cointegration and Wald test of joint significance respectively on autoregressive distributed lag models estimated with data from nine Asian economies. The findings on the strength of interest rate pass-through are related to each country's trilemma configuration. Overall, our empirical results provide some supporting evidence that the Asian economies are still constrained by the open economy trilemma.","Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Chow, HK (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",hkchow@smu.edu.sg,"CHOW, Hwee Kwan/D-1423-2009","Chow, Hwee Kwan/0000-0002-4520-9102",,,,,21,3,3,0,10,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

These methods have the ability of considering only one criterion at a time, which is usually the cost of the investment. A multicriteria method is proposed for taking care of many conflicting criteria of health research investments. The difficulty of measuring intangible criteria is captured by the fuzzy set theory.

The recent European public debt crisis of peripheral countries (including Italy) shows that when internal imbalances are out of control they can constrain growth and domestic demand in a severe way. Recently, Soukiazis et al. (2013) developed a model - henceforth the SCA model - that takes into account both internal and external imbalances and where relative prices are not neutral in the pace of economic growth. The SCA model proved to be accurate in explaining economic growth in Portugal. The aim of the present paper is to apply the SCA model to Italy and check its precision for explaining the growth path in this country. Italy is an interesting case study of a larger economy with a lack of growth in the last decade facing serious internal imbalances caused by high deficit and public debt.

This paper uses data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey to reexamine gender-related dimensions of the 2007-2009 recession. Unlike most previous work, we analyze data that connects men's and women's employment status to that of their spouses. A difference-in-difference framework is used to characterize how labor-market outcomes for one spouse varied according to outcomes for the other. Results show that that employment rates of women whose husbands were non-employed rose significantly in the recession, while those for people in other situations held steady or fell-consistent with the view that women took on additional bread-winning responsibilities to make up for lost income. However, probabilities of non-participation did not rise by more for men with working wives than they did for other men, casting doubt on ideas that men in this situation made weaker efforts to return to work because they could count on their wives' paychecks to support the household.","Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Starr, MA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Kreeger Hall 118,4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",mstarr@american.edu,,,,,,,48,28,33,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

These characteristics make it a particularly interesting case study of the determinants of military spending. This paper specifies and estimates an econometric model of the Egyptian demand for military spending, taking into account important strategic and political factors. Both economic and strategic factors are found to play a role in determining military burden/spending, with clear positive effects of lagged military burden, suggesting some sort of institutional inertia, plus negative output and net exports effects. The strategic effect as a result of the impact of Israel's military burden is mostly positive and significant, though its impact is reduced when the impact of important strategic events are taken into account. The military spending of Egypt's allies Jordan and Syria generally seems to have had no effect on Egypt's spending. These results are consistent over a range of econometric techniques.","[Abdelfattah, Yasmine M.; Zaher, Shadwa] British Univ Egypt, Dept Econ, Greater Cairo, Egypt; [Abu-Qarn, Aamer S.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Dunne, J.

Our results show that early land inequality has a detrimental influence on math and science skills even a century later. We find that this influence is causal, using an instrumental variable (IV) approach with geological, climatic and other variables that are intrinsically exogenous. A second major contribution of our study is our assessment of the persistence of numerical cognitive skills, which are an important component of modern human capital measures. Early numeracy around 1820 is estimated using the age-heaping strategy. We argue that countries with early investments in numerical education entered a path-dependency of human capital-intensive industries, including skill-intensive agriculture and services. The combined long-run effects of land inequality and human capital path-dependence are assessed for the first time in this article.

Other axioms include scale invariance, strong monotonicity, and a continuity condition. These axioms characterize a family of path-based measures.

We find that a higher divorce probability and changes in wage structure are each able to explain a large proportion of the LFP increase. Higher divorce risk increases LFP not because the latter contributes to higher marital assets or greater labour market experience, however. Instead, it is the result of conflicting spousal preferences towards the adjustment of marital consumption in the face of increased divorce risk.","NYU, NBER, CEPR, ESOP,IZA, New York, NY 10012 USA; Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); New York University; International Monetary Fund,"Fernández, R (通讯作者)，NYU, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",raquel.fernandez@nyu.edu,,,,,,,52,37,47,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

These stylized facts question the focus of the traditional literature on average (beta-)convergence and suggest substantial nonlinearities in regional convergence processes that have yet to be understood in detail.

One more firm in the market is associated with a reduction of the price leader's markup which is equivalent to competition between existing firms for an additional 3 weeks in the product life cycle. Our results support search theoretic models and contradict models of monopolistic competition. Moreover our results support the existence of price dynamics over the product cycle.

Using multinominal logit regressions, we find that the coincidence of such tail events cannot be explained solely by common supply and demand fundamentals. Instead, we provide evidence that the transmission of extreme price changes occurs through a financial demand channel. Specifically, changes in the net long position of hedge funds are associated with a significant increase in the probability of coincident large positive and negative returns across energy markets. Evidence that index investments drive tail events is limited. Further, we identify adverse shocks to speculator funding liquidity as determinant of synchronized price drops across energy markets. The likelihood of extreme negative returns in more than one market significantly increases when the TED spread rises. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With the domestic consumers of US goods, the present study aims to compare the US product prices before and after the effectuation of the Korea-US FTA and to measure the consumer welfare pursuant to the changes in product prices. The analysis shows the following results. First, meat, juice (beverage) and groceries (nuts) satisfied welfare by decreasing in price after the effectuation of the FTA. Second, meat, groceries (nuts), clothes and fashion products have significant influences on welfare according to the multiple regression analysis.

We prospectively analyze an employer wage subsidy targeted at youth, a policy recently enacted by the South African government to address the issue. Recognizing that a credible estimate of the policy's impact requires a model of the labor market that itself generates high unemployment in equilibrium, we estimate a structural search model that incorporates both observed heterogeneity and measurement error in wages. Using the model to simulate the policy, we find that a R1000/month wage subsidy paid to employers leads to an increase of R596 in mean accepted wages and a decrease of 12 percentage points in the share of youth experiencing long-term unemployment.

We then link these abnormal returns to features of the RTA members and the agreements themselves. We find strong evidence of the natural trading partner hypothesis; stock markets rise more when RTAs are signed between countries that already engage in high volumes of trade.

We examine this proposition in the context of medieval Venice circa 800-1600. Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of merchants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remarkably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long-distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected barriers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from political openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oligarchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their families' use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400-1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade. Monopolization led to the rise of extreme inequality, with those who were powerful before 1297 emerging as the undisputed winners.","[Puga, Diego] CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Toronto,"Puga, D (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Madrid, Spain.",dtrefler@rotman.utoronto.ca,"Puga, Diego/A-9184-2008","Puga, Diego/0000-0003-2640-1534",,,,,114,52,54,1,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

As in many creative industries, publishers often focus their advertising activities on potential top sellers written by recent bestselling authors. Considering potential selection effects in choosing the right books for advertising, this paper investigates (1) whether selection effects exist and to what extent potential selection effects influence the relation between book advertising and book sales and (2) the boundary conditions under which book advertising leads to higher sales by focusing on the star power effects of authors. By applying propensity score matching to a dataset of 598 fiction books from the German book market, we identify substantial selection effects that lead to a serious overestimation of advertising effectiveness by up to 41 % (10,000 copies sold). Using group analyses, we find that sales of books written by recent bestselling authors are not significantly influenced by advertising activities of publishers; however, the sales of books written by lesser-known authors can be increased significantly if they are advertised. Our findings are highly relevant for publishers, indicating that a shift in the allocation of advertising budgets toward promising books by lesser-known authors is recommended to improve the overall advertising effectiveness.","[Shehu, Edlira; Prostka, Tim; Schmidt-Stoelting, Christina; Clement, Michel; Bloemeke, Eva] Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt & Media, Res Ctr Media & Commun, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Clement, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt & Media, Res Ctr Media & Commun, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",edlira.shehu@uni-hamburg.de; tim.prostka@uni-hamburg.de; cs_stoelting@gmx.de; michel@michelclement.com; evabloemeke@googlemail.com,"Clement, Michel/GQQ-1785-2022","Clement, Michel/0000-0001-6769-6709; Shehu, Edlira/0000-0002-1807-0731",,,,,70,9,11,0,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This paper trancends the previous paradigm and explores novel aspects of evolution in economics. Within the traditional paradigm change is provided by directional selection (and directional innovation). However, the full definition of evolutionary processes has to include two important types of selection that change the variance without necessarily changing the mean. Stabilizing selection removes any outlier and diversifying selection promotes the coexistence of behavioural variants. This paper emphasizes the need for an integrated analysis of all three types of selection. It also demonstrates that the evolutionary algebra provided by Price's equation increases the intellectual coherence and power of thinking about selection and other aspects of evolutionary processes. Directional, stabilizing and diversifying selection are then related to fitness functions that can produce the different types of selection; and the functions are used for simple simulations of the change of the population distribution of a quantitative characteristic. Finally, the paper adds to evolutionary economics a novel way of using Price's equation to decompose the statistics of the changes of the frequency distributions. The changes of mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis are all decomposed as the sum of a selection effect and an intra-member effect. It is especially the signs of these effects that serve to define and characterize the different types of selection. Both this result and the general analysis of the types of selection are of relevance for applied evolutionary economics.","[Andersen, Esben Sloth; Holm, Jacob Rubaek] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Andersen, ES (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Fibigerstraede 11, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.",esa@business.aau.dk,"Holm, Jacob Rubæk/H-9402-2017","Holm, Jacob Rubæk/0000-0003-1110-1918",,,,,38,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

To conduct the analysis we took advantage of a unique dataset that contains administrative records for individuals observed in formal employment one year after graduation from college and that contains detailed information for degree subjects. The results suggest that, on average the wage gap against women is about 11%, from which 40% is explained by gender diferences in the type of degree chosen. By using a distributional gender wage gap decomposition we find evidence not only of an increasing gap at diferent levels of the wage distribution but evidence that only 30% of it is explained by degree subject. This result also supports the existence of a glass ceiling phenomenon from early stages of labour market experience which is of particular interest for policy makers given that, some of the explanations given to the glass ceiling efect are related to experience and promotions, characteristics that are not significantly diferent for recent graduates.","[Cepeda Emiliani, Laura; Cardona Sosa, Lina] Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Emiliani, LC (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia.",jbaron@worldbank.org,,,,,,,28,0,0,2,24,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Learning by doing and knowledge accumulation ignores the interruptive nature of technology advancement. Creative destruction can be understood by using knowledge metabolism. Policies and institutions co-evolve during different stages of technology cycles. Division of labor is limited by the market extent, numbers of resources, and environment fluctuations. There is a trade-off between the stability and complexity of an ecological-industrial system. Diversified patterns in development strategy are shaped by culture and environment when facing learning uncertainty. The Western mode of division of labor is characterized by labor-saving and resource-intensive technology, while the Asian and Chinese modes feature resource-saving and labor-intensive technology.

This study aims to examine the relationship between external indebtedness and growth variables. In this context, Markov-switching model is used because it allows the examination of unobservable variables in an observable model and provides steady algorithm to achieve robust optimization by iterations in a dynamic system, and is more flexible than prior models. This paper concentrates on the analysis of Turkey and utilizes the data set for the period of 1974 to 2009. Throughout the analyses, the relationship between growth and external borrowing is examined in terms of public and private external borrowing. Paper yields that, according to results of multivariate dynamic Markov-switching model, the main growth variables such as investment and human capital have positive impact on growth as expected. Findings can be summarized as follows; firstly, public and/or private external borrowing has negative impact on growth both in regime at zero and regime at one. Secondly, the negative impact of public borrowing on economic growth and development is higher than that of private borrowing on economic growth and development. Eventually, the conclusion reveals that the economic development and borrowing variables do not follow a linear path. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We adopt an ordinal approach to social welfare comparisons by searching for socially desirable reforms that would improve social welfare for an entire class of social welfare functions. In the model, there is a discrete distribution of individuals' productivities and individuals are heterogeneous with respect to leisure preferences (or disability of work). Labor supply decisions are limited to the participation decision. Unemployment is modeled in a search and matching framework with individual wage bargaining. For the social welfare analysis, the model is calibrated for Switzerland. Starting from a situation with an unemployment benefit scheme, the introduction of in-work benefits is shown to be a socially desirable reform: it would be unanimously preferred to the current situation according to all social welfare functions based on the criteria of Pareto, anonymity, and the principle of transfers. This result holds for two different types of preference heterogeneity (leisure preferences or disability of work) and also for the case where job search effort cannot be monitored.","[van Baalen, Brigitte] Swiss Fed Tax Adm, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland; [Mueller, Tobias] Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Müller, T (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, 40 Boul Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",Brigitte.vanBaalen@estv.admin.ch; Tobias.Mueller@unige.ch,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The theory is based on the idea that the size distribution is the result of the competition between banks for permanent deposit money. The exchange of deposits causes a preferential growth of banks with a fitness that is determined by the competitive advantage to attract permanent deposits.

These tests fail to reject the presence of bubble-like trends and nonlinearity beyond ARCH for all seventeen commodity series.

A primary surplus is required. Then a government can escape its debt trap either through sustained annual monetary outflows from society to the government (taxation) but with a low initial growth rate, or through annual monetary inflows into both sectors (stimulus) with higher initial growth rate.

I decompose the change in the distribution of net income into a direct (tax) effect and an indirect effect. The indirect effect is further decomposed into evasion and productivity effects using existing estimates of these respective elasticities. As expected, the direct tax effect increased net income inequality. Changes in the pre-tax distribution (indirect effect), on the other hand, had a large negative impact on inequality thus leading to an overall decline in net income inequality. I also find that the tax-induced evasion response increased reported net income inequality while reducing consumption inequality. To the extent that consumption approximates actual income, these results demonstrate that the flat tax reform had a much smaller effect on actual income inequality than on reported income inequality. More importantly, relative to non-tax factor, the reform had little overall effect on income inequality. This suggests that objection to flatter tax schedules on the grounds of income inequality is mostly misguided, especially in transitional countries with high levels of evasion.

First, when reserve prices are exogenously set to be sellers' reservation values, a social planner would order sellers from low to high based on their reservation values, which yields a uniquely efficient order that maximizes the social welfare. However, an auctioneer charged with maximizing the total profit of all sellers would want to reverse the increasing order in certain situations. Second, when reserve prices can be endogenously selected in addition to the order of sellers, the auctioneer would always want to adopt the increasing order for the optimally chosen reserve prices. Sequential auctions with optimally chosen reserve prices and an increasing order are shown optimal among the class of voluntary and incentive-compatible mechanisms.","[Gong, Qiang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xu] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Xing, Yiqing] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Stanford University,"Tan, X (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",qgong@swufe.edu.cn; tanxu@uw.edu; xingyq@stanford.edu,"Tan, Xu/C-2301-2017",,,,,,11,3,5,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

I embed imperfect information as in Lorenzoni (2009) into a Smets and Wouters (2007)-type DSGE model. Agents only observe aggregate productivity and a signal about the permanent component contaminated with noise. Based on this information agents form beliefs about the temporary and the permanent component of productivity. Shocks to the signal (noise shocks) trigger aggregate fluctuations unrelated to changes in productivity. Bayesian estimation shows that noise shocks explain up to 14 percent of output and up to 25 percent of consumption fluctuations. Nominal rigidities and the specification of the monetary policy rule are crucial for the importance of noise shocks. These features help to resolve conflicting results in the previous literature.

There is an upper threshold for the number of competing firms, however, above which such schemes are no longer sustainable as an equilibrium.

Our results suggest that, as early as two centuries preceding the Industrial Revolution, England had already escaped the Malthusian Epoch and entered a post-Malthusian regime, where income per capita continued to spur population growth but was no longer stagnant. Our formulation of a post-Malthusian hypothesis implies cointegration between vital rates (birth- and death rates) and income and builds explicitly on a simple model of Malthusian stagnation. We show that this hypothesis can be interpreted as an extension of the latter model where the negative Malthusian feedback effect from population on income, as implied by diminishing returns to labor, is offset by a positive Boserupian and/or Smithian scale effect of population on technology.","[Moller, Niels Framroze] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Moller, Niels Framroze] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Sharp, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark,"Moller, NF (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Management Engn, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",nfmo@dtu.dk,"Sharp, Paul/C-1027-2019; Moller, Niels Framroze/I-6934-2016","Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-0679-0106; Moller, Niels Framroze/0000-0001-8355-2940",,,,,55,28,28,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

To address endogeneity concerns we extend the instrumental-variables strategy introduced by Frankel and Romer (1999). We build predictors of openness to immigration and to trade for each country by using information on bilateral geographical and cultural distance (while controlling for country size). Since geography may affect income through other channels, we also control for climate, disease environment, natural resources, and colonial origins. Most importantly, we also account for the roles of institutions and early development. Our instrumental-variables estimates provide evidence of a robust, positive effect of openness to immigration on long-run income per capita. In contrast, we are unable to establish an effect of trade openness on income. We also show that the effect of migration operates through an increase in total factor productivity, which appears to reflect increased diversity in productive skills and, to some extent, a higher rate of innovation.

We solve for the market equilibrium and examine the sensitivity of relative sizes of occupational groups, and of the level of productivity, to changes in the exogenous parameters. The results show that the positive (negative) association between number of SEWEs (SEWNEs) and productivity, observed in the Spanish data, can be explained, under certain conditions, as the result of cross-region and time differences in average skills.

However, all these approaches regard inflation as the unintentional result of the behavior of interest groups. In this paper we take the opposite view, namely, that when there is polarization of financial wealth, inflation is used as a tax to transfer the burden of stabilization onto some interest groups. In countries characterized by financial polarization, stabilization can occur only when there is a change in the political and economic equilibrium, and when parties which represent interest groups adverse to inflation support a new government coalition. The estimates of a Probit model support this hypothesis: the stabilizations after World War I and after the Great Inflation of the 1970s in several European countries showed remarkable political regularities. In fact, generally, these stabilizations occurred when there was a reversal of the political-economic equilibrium and government coalitions including rentiers' representatives took power.

It has been well-documented that lack of sleep leads to diminished cognitive performance and that people who sleep less are more likely to be overweight or obese. I use data from the American Time Use Survey to examine two factors that can potentially influence the amount of time children sleep: school and maternal employment. I find that school-age children sleep less when school is in session than during the summer, and that they get less sleep on school nights than on non-school nights. Children go to bed about 38 min earlier on school nights, but wake up about 72 min earlier on school days. This translates into about 34 min less sleep on school nights compared with non-school nights, and implies that these children have a cumulative sleep deficit of over two-and-a-half hours by the time they arrive at school Friday morning. In addition to the lost sleep time, the earlier wake-up times on school days appear to disrupt children's natural sleep cycles. Maternal employment affects children's sleep time in the summer, because children wake up earlier on days that their mothers work. But during the school year, maternal employment effects are dominated by school effects.","US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Stewart, J (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, 2 Massachusetts Ave NE, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",Stewart.Jay@bls.gov,,,,,,,22,6,7,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

AYP-fail status is associated with negative publicity and often sanctions. Using data from Wisconsin and alternate regression discontinuity designs, I study the incentives and responses of schools that failed AYP once. Math-induced AYP-failures showed strong improvements in math, while reading-induced AYP-failures showed marked improvements in reading. Consistent with incentives, these schools showed no positive effect in other high stakes objectives. In contrast, test-participation failures showed no effect in either high stakes reading or math, while they showed some evidence of positive (though not statistically significant) effects in test participation. Improvements in reading are associated with parallel effects in low stakes language arts (possibly due to spillover effects), while there is no evidence of effects in low stakes science or social studies. Nor is there evidence of effects on graduation rates. Performance in low stakes grades suffered, and so did performance in weaker subgroups in spite of their inclusion in AYP computations. There is evidence of focus on marginal students around high stakes cutoffs in subject areas AYP-failed schools improved in, but this did not come at the expense of ends. Credibility of threat mattered-AYP-failed schools that faced more competition responded considerably more strongly in the objectives they had incentives in. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In otherwise standard two-sector neoclassical sticky-price models with flexible durable prices, following monetary tightening, nondurables decrease but consumer durables increase. Friction in lending between households can resolve the comovement problem if durable prices are sticky. However, if durable prices are flexible, friction in lending fails to generate joint decline. This paper resolves the co-movement problem by adding capital into a model with flexible durable prices and friction in lending. When capital is needed in production, monetary tightening reduces the relative price of durables which induces investment and decreases firms' real profits in the short run. Due to fewer profits remitted from firms, savers have a lower disposable income and cannot increase expenditures on consumer durables as much as otherwise. As a consequence, aggregate consumer durables decrease and there is a joint decline of nondurables and consumer durables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our main results suggest that IPRs have a positive impact on imports, which is driven by a positive effect on the extensive margin and a negative impact on the intensive margin.

Our work departs from the dominant models of poverty by considering destitution among a specific category of workers known as the working poor. Low wages and job insecurity in the informal sector in developing economies can create and perpetuate destitution among the working poor. Our precise contributions are three-fold: first, in order to understand causes and consequences of destitution, we develop an index of destitution from social exclusion of the working poor. Secondly, we test the predictions of this index by using micro-data collected from a sample survey in Bangladesh.

Our simulation results indicate that China's welfare gain from trade bargaining will increase over time if countries keep their present higher GDP growth rates for several decades, but there are major difference when using different bargaining solution concepts.

Three societal characteristics are considered proxies for collective memory: the current institutional framework as indicator for present common experiences; the cultural attitudes as proxy for long-term developments; and severe shocks in the history of the regions. The primary aim is thus to understand whether collective memory permits identification of not only the effects of recent (i.e. institutional) or distant (i.e. cultural) on-going experiences, but also of the impact of such relevant shocks. For this purpose, a comprehensive case study is conducted within a cross-border research area with special historical development, where it is possible to discriminate between these three indicators of collective memory. The findings suggest a significant impact of collective memory on social capital endowment. Particularly striking shocks are sustained in the collective memory of a community, influencing its behavior even long after the incident occurred.

Despite this, fluoridation remains a controversial issue. Some in the public are antithetical to the science behind fluoridation while others view it as an infringement on individual choice. Voting data from referendums in two of the six largest US cities without fluoridated water (Portland, Oregon, and Wichita, Kansas) are used to examine the factors driving voter demand for and against fluoridation. Although regression analysis reveals differences between the cities, a strong commonality is greater support for fluoride coming from voting precincts with higher concentrations of college graduates. Additionally, even though advocates often laud water fluoridation as a relatively inexpensive way to extend dental health benefits to all children (regardless of income levels), presence of children in households surprisingly does not appear to translate into voter support. Lastly, after controlling for socio-economic factors, results suggest that opposition to fluoridation does not appear to come from the political centre, but from the libertarian right and environmental left.","[Hersch, Philip L.; Pelkowski, Jodi E.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS USA",Wichita State University,"Hersch, PL (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS USA.",philip.hersch@wichita.edu,,,,,,,6,3,3,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The measures exhibit three waves whose timing roughly corresponds to the diffusion of mainframe computers in the 1960s and 1970s, personal computers in the 1980s and the Internet in the late 1990s. After controlling for other influences, I find that the probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment responds negatively to an increase in either measure.

The size of the shadow economy as % of official GDP was estimated previously using a special case of the structural equation models - the MIMIC model, recording the value of 40% at the beginning of 2000 and following a downward trend over the analyzed period. The results of ARDL approach pointed out that there is no long-run relation between unemployment rates and the Romanian shadow economy. The relationship between the two variables is further tested by imposing a long-run restriction in the Structural VAR model to analyze the effect in the size of the Romanian shadow economy to a temporary shock in unemployment rates. The impulse response function generated by the Structural VAR confirms that in the short run, a rise in the recorded unemployment rate will lead to an increase in the size of the shadow economy, meanwhile an increase in the ILO unemployment rate highlighted a decrease in the size of the shadow economy.","Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Davidescu, AA (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania.",adrianaalexandru@yahoo.com,"Alexandru, Adriana AnaMaria/D-2755-2015",,,,,,42,7,7,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We analyze the extent to which opening policy is affected by lobbying efforts and rent-seeking behaviors. We obtain the counterintuitive result that corruption may improve social welfare when the government neglects corruption and does not prevent it, as the scope for the entry of a foreign private firm is greater. Moreover, the government may prevent corrupt activities by policy-makers by requiring the entrant firm to buy a license to operate in the market. In this case, the scope for external opening up is greater than in the other cases and social welfare is further improved when the entrant firm is foreign-owned. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a first assessment of the role of demand elasticity on the profit, consumer and welfare effects of BBPD. We show that the demand expansion effect, that is obviously overlooked by the standard framework with unit demand, plays a relevant role. In comparison to uniform pricing, we show that firms are worse off under BBPD, however, as demand elasticity increases the negative impact of BBPD on profits gets smaller. Despite a possible slight increase in the average prices charged over the two periods in comparison to uniform pricing, we show that BBPD boosts consumer surplus and that this benefit is independent of elasticity. In contrast to the welfare results derived under the unit demand assumption, where BBPD is always bad for welfare, the paper shows that BBPD can be welfare enhancing if demand elasticity is sufficiently high.

The results for men also suggest a lower impact of cash, but differences between cash and in-kind grants are less robust.

In particular, Lelkes examines the impact of religious behaviour on self-reported well-being. Using ordered logit models, Lelkes estimates and presents the marginal effect associated with membership in the highest fully satisfied' category, and finds that religious people have a consistently higher probability of being fully satisfied' than others. This effect is stable in the 1992 and 1998 samples. The goal of this article is to expand and extend Lelkes' earlier work in several ways. First, we use a different dataset. Second, we examine the effect of religious behaviour on well-being after transition not only for Hungary, but also for Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. Third, unlike Lelkes, we have access to information indicating whether respondents report being financially better off after transition. With a different dataset, additional country samples, and a measure of financial well-being, we are able to confirm and extend Lelkes' finding that religious behaviour is associated with improved well-being after transition in all countries we examine.","[Florea, Alin I.] Auburn Univ, Rhodes Coll, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Caudill, Steven B.] Auburn Univ, Rhodes Coll, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Florea, AI (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Rhodes Coll, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",florea.alin.i@gmail.com; caudills@rhodes.edu,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Among these there is sustainability. No longer merely a buzzword, sustainability is becoming a mainstay of organizational operations, and a strategic pre-requisite for long term competitive advantages and business excellence. Crafting and implementing of strategy adapted to the company's external context and internal resources and capabilities are fundamental, and sustainability needs to be a central element to any such strategy. As such, tools are required that can bring these components together. Long used for performance management and strategic management more generally, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) could plausibly constitute such a framework, if appropriately extended to include sustainability concerns. The aim of this paper is thus to develop such an extension, through creation of a Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC), which includes social and environmental perspectives and their interactions with the traditional perspectives. We outline the structure for a SBSC, which takes companies' overall sustainability objectives into account, as well as the steps required for its development. A case study of the formation and introduction of a credible sustainability strategy in the chemical industry is presented. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the SBSC in pursuing sustainability strategies, and provide preliminary evidence that introduction of such a system is likely to lead to fundamental changes in the way a company is managed. Practical implications and managerial guidelines are also reported.","[Fulop, Gyula; Hernadi, Bettina] Univ Miskolc, Inst Business Sci, H-3515 Miskolc, Hungary; [Jalali, Marjan; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva; Ferreira, Fernando A.

We analyse the properties of the short-term macroeconomic equilibrium in the presence of a climate policy, which may take the form either of a carbon tax or of quotas of pollution permits. We show that in the short run climate policy (or its strengthening) is simultaneously a negative aggregate supply shock and a positive aggregate demand shock. It is thus inflationary but it has an ambiguous impact on aggregate economic activity and employment: it will only stimulate output in an economy where nominal wages are rigid enough. In all cases, climate policy will depress real wages. We also analyse the interactions between climate policy and the usual macroeconomic policies of demand (fiscal and monetary stimuli) and supply (labour tax cut). The multiplier effects of these demand and supply policies depend on the instrument chosen for implementing the climate policy (carbon tax or pollution permits). We finally establish the conditions under which a reform combining a climate policy strengthening and a labour tax cut can reach the double objective of a lower carbon footprint and a lower unemployment rate, without reducing workers' real wages. Such a policy reform has however an ambiguous impact on the government surplus (or deficit).","[Hanoteau, Julien] Aix Marseille Univ, KEDGE Business Sch, Marseille, France; [Hanoteau, Julien] Aix Marseille Univ, GREQAM, Marseille, France",Kedge Business School; Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Hanoteau, J (通讯作者)，Domaine Luminy BP 921, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",julien.hano-teau@kedgebs.com,"Hanoteau, julien/U-3189-2018","Hanoteau, julien/0000-0003-2951-9466",,,,,65,4,4,0,9,DE BOECK UNIV,LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE,"FOND JEAN-PAQUES 4,, B-1348 LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM",0770-4518,1782-1495,,RECH ECON LOUVAIN,Rech.

Combining these results with what we know about the relationship between teacher value-added and experience, I show that paying teachers more improves student achievement through higher retention rates. The results also suggest that adopting a flat salary schedule may be a cheap way to improve student performance. I find no evidence that pay effects vary by the teacher's gender or subject taught.

Workers may find a job through their social contacts and on the formal market. The presence of social contacts increases the overall welfare in society as it rises the number of workers earning high wages and decreases the unemployment rate. However, unemployed workers finding a job through social ties earn lower wages on average than those who obtain a job on the formal market. This result follows from on-the-job search: employed workers pass only those offers on to their neighbors that pay (weakly) lower wages than their current wages earned. Despite the wage discount, unemployed workers still might find it beneficial to search via social ties because arrival rate of offers is higher for this channel than for the formal market when the number of neighbors is sufficiently large. There is a trade-off between unemployment duration and wages earned for workers obtaining a job via social ties.","Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Horvath, G (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, 227 Zhizhi Bldg,555 Liutai Rd, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",horvathgergely@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We check the differences between these two methods considering also several household characteristics. The index we use is that of Foster, Greer and Thorbecke, FGT, with alpha = 0 and alpha = 2. When alpha = 0; each method identifies the chronically poor (which could be different individuals by each method) and shows the percentage of the chronically poor, while when alpha = 2; the methods also take into account the depth of poverty. Our main goal is to show the differences between the two methods, so that policymakers would have different perspectives on the problem of chronic poverty and could make decisions on this basis. The results show that, in the data used, the permanent method and the spells method classify the households into chronically poor and nonchronically poor definitions almost similarly in some cases. Thus, when measuring chronic poverty using the FGT index with alpha = 0, the levels of chronic poverty measured by the two methods are quite the same for the whole population as well as for subgroups of the population. Nevertheless, when using the FGT index with alpha = 2, the permanent method and the spells method give different results, as they take into account the depth of poverty differently.","[Israeli, O.] Ashkelon Acad Coll, Dept Econ, Ashqelon, Israel; [Weber, M.] Ono Acad Coll, Fac Business Management, Kiryat Ono, Israel; [Weber, M.] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Management, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Israeli, O (通讯作者)，Ashkelon Acad Coll, Dept Econ, 12 Ytzchak Ben Tzvi St, Ashqelon, Israel.",Israeli.osnat@gmail.com,"Israeli, Osnat/GQP-1935-2022",,,,,,25,3,3,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Data was collected from 267 respondents from different organizations in the services sector of Pakistan, i.e. telecom, banking, health and educational institutions. Transformational leadership was measured with a 20-item MLQ, multifactor leadership questionnaire, emotional intelligence was measured a 16-item scale (WLEIS, Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale) and a 25-item scale (OCQ) measured the organizational commitment. The moderating role of emotional intelligence was assessed by creating an interaction term and was regressed with a dependent variable. This study provides managers with a new way to look at their employees attitudes, especially their commitment to their organization. Managers from the services sector of Pakistan should pay attention to their emotional intelligence competencies and should utilize these competencies for promoting a sense of respect among their employees, by valuing their cultural norms and thus enhancing their commitment to the organization. These results also identify the importance of training programmes for enhancing both leadership and emotional intelligence competencies. This is a comparatively easy and inexpensive way of gaining employee commitment as compared to some costly rewards and benefit packages.","[Khan, Muhammad Ibrahim] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Awan, Usama] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Vehari, Pakistan; [Yasir, Muhammad; Bin Mohamad, Noor Azmi; Qureshi, Muhammad Imran] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Shah, Syed Haider Ali] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Zaman, Khalid] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Abbottabad, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Malaya; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Khan, MI (通讯作者)，COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Management Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.",,"Zaman, Khalid/P-1727-2015; Yasir, Muhammad/S-1254-2018; Yasir, Muhammad/HHC-1474-2022; Qureshi, Muhammad Imran/I-4390-2016; Yasir, Muhammad/HPC-7061-2023; Awan, Usama/K-5538-2013; Yasir, Muhammad/F-8169-2016","Zaman, Khalid/0000-0002-2585-2790; Yasir, Muhammad/0000-0002-4665-6633; Qureshi, Muhammad Imran/0000-0001-8861-0628; Awan, Usama/0000-0002-6185-9594; Yasir, Muhammad/0000-0002-4665-6633; Shah, Syed Haider/0000-0002-4898-3769",,,,,73,10,15,1,33,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Doing so, they face a trade-off between saving on fixed costs per shipments (by shipping large amounts infrequently) and saving on storage costs (by delivering just in time with small and frequent shipments). The firm's optimal choice defines a mapping from size and frequency of shipments to fixed costs per shipment. We use a unique dataset of Swiss cross-border trade on the transaction level to infer the size and shape of the underlying fixed costs. The inferred fixed costs are specific to each firm-country-product combination. Our results suggest that the fixed costs per shipment of the average Swiss exporter are large, ranging between 0.82% of the export value in our most conservative specification and 5.4%.

Previous authors mostly indicated significant highly volatile comovements between the markets. In addition, it was proven in several markets that in times of financial crisis the comovements between financial markets are becoming stronger and negative correlations appear indicating flight-to-quality from stocks to government bonds. Despite of that, there exists a tendency to analyze only financial markets of Eurozone countries leaving the rest of the EU members behind. The aim of this research was to fill this gap by providing insights of co-movements between stocks and government bond markets of al thel EU countries together with recommendations for portfolio diversification. The first stage of the research was implemented by using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Logarithmic returns on 52 market indices were used for calculations of correlation coefficients in the period of 1993-2012. The second stage of the research included the estimation of correlations in the period of 2008-2013, commonly referred to as financial crisis. In addition, statistical significance of coefficients was evaluated by testing Fisher's null hypothesis. The results of the research show that majority of correlation coefficients between stock and government bond indices were rather small and not significant during the full sample period with the exception in financial markets of Greece, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania (weak-medium statistically significant correlations). The results indicate financial markets in the countries mentioned being more related than in the rest of the EU countries, not being suitable for diversification between asset classes. No significant negative correlation between market indices in 1993-2013 was recorded implying that in times of stock market fall government bond markets would not be the safe haven for investors. Analysis of comovements between stock and government bond markets of the EU countries in the period from 2008 resulted in increase of correlation coefficients in 19 of 25 EU countries analyzed indicating strengthened comovements in times of financial stress. Despite of that, most of these correlations were positive. This is not beneficial for investors as diversification effect might disappear when it's most needed. As exceptions should be mentioned Scandinavian countries where significant negative correlation coefficients obtained between stock and government bond indices indicate an existence of flight-to-quality. This could not be confirmed for the rest of the EU countries' markets. The results of the research partly comply with the results of previous studies in the topic, mostly confirming the tendencies for biggest EU financial markets. The research can be further implemented towards different directions: inclusion of the US as the major financial market, concentration on the countries with strongest comovements and provision of detailed estimation of them; inclusion of corporate bond indices; choice of other method for estimation of comovements between financial markets of the EU countries. Finally, the analysis needs more focus on the investigation of the reasons for differences in the relationship between financial markets.","[Levisauskaite, Kristina] Vytautas Magnus Univ, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Alekneviciene, Vilija; Alekneviciute, Egle] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, LT-53361 Akademija, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Vytautas Magnus University,"Levisauskaite, K (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",k.levisauskaite@evf.vdu.lt; vilija.alekneviciene@asu.lt; egle.alekneviciute@gmail.com,,"Alekneviciene, Vilija/0000-0002-6501-8792",,,,,34,3,3,1,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, there are substantial variations in the extent of the generic competition across countries. This study empirically estimates the determinants of the generic market share in Taiwan, where medical providers are in a position to profit directly from the sale of prescription drugs. Our empirical results point out that the profit-seeking behavior of medical providers plays an important and dominant role behind generic competition in the pharmaceutical market. As a result, there is a positive association between the generic-to-brand price ratio and the generic market share in Taiwan's pharmaceutical market, which contrasts with the conventional empirical finding that the relationship between the generic-to-brand price ratio and generic market share is negative. An important implication of our study is that the profit-seeking behavior of medical providers undermines the policy effectiveness of using generic competition as the cost containment strategy in the health care market.","[Liu, Ya-Ming] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Chee-Ruey] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Liu, YM (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd,Social Sci Bldg 8F Tainan, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.",ymliu@mail.ncku.edu.tw; crh@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The majority of women work in the informal sector or on small pieces of land and are engaged in care work with little or no pay. Also, women have limited access to credit, land, agricultural inputs, equipment and extension services, as well as markets for their produce than men. Some of the inequities are embedded in the deep-rooted cultural norms and beliefs in the African societies. To some extent, the inequalities can partly be addressed by changing of policies that reinforce gender inequalities as well as formulating and enforcing laws that promote womens economic empowerment. Thus, more comprehensive research work is still required to highlight challenges associated with gender inequality and what needs to be done to move towards reducing gender inequality. The four papers in this journal supplement explore the issue of gender inequality and look at theoretical and empirical relationship between gender and economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first paper by Seguino and Were is on Gender, Development and Economic Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper shows that a shift in emphasis of central bank targets to employment and public investment can help reduce gender gap. The second paper by Cheryl Doss focuses on Collecting Gender Disaggregated Data to Improve Development Policies. Its main finding is that consistent measures of gender asset and wealth gaps provide a means of tracking important dimensions of policies designed to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. The third paper is on Gender and Economic Empowerment in Africa: Evidence and Policy by Naomi Netsayi Wekwete. The paper shows that initiatives that improve womens economic empowerment such as skills training among others promote economic growth and development. Finally, the fourth paper by Nancy Folbre is on The Care Economy in Africa: Subsistence Production and Unpaid Care. The main finding of the paper is that economic policies that reduce the care burden on women with investments that enhance reproductive choice increase the productivity of unpaid work and pool the risks of caring for dependents through social insurance which promotes economic growth by improving the capabilities of both women and children to free up labour time for more remunerative activities.","[Manda, Damiano K.; Mwakubo, Samuel] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Manda, DK (通讯作者)，3rd Floor Middle East Bank Towers Bldg,Miliman Rd, Nairobi, Kenya.",damiano.manda@aercafrica.org,,,,,,,15,10,12,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Income inequality, on the other hand, is measured by Theil Indexand is used to measure the inequality among similarcategories of ethnic groups, location and education. The study finds that the incidence of poverty is higher in the rural population, increases with age groups, declines with increasing level of education, higher among Bumiputera group, households headed by males, and households headed by non-married persons. Average income is higher among urban households areas compared to rural ones, higher among the Chinese households compared to Indian and Bumiputera in that order, and increases with groups with more members having higher education. Income inequality is higher among urban households, among Indians and Bumiputeras but lower among the Chinese, and shows no clear pattern with increasing education.","[Mohd, Saidatulakmal; Hamat, Abdul Fatah Che] Univ Sains Malaysia, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Idris, Muhammad] Econ Planning Unit, Putrajaya, Malaysia; [Kasim, Norfariza Hanim] Dept Stat, Putrajaya, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Mohd, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",eieydda@usm.my; abdfatah@usm.my; mbi@epu.gov.my; fariza@epu.gov.my,"Mohd, Saidatulakmal/J-1535-2014","Mohd, Saidatulakmal/0000-0002-7947-7324",,,,,20,1,1,1,12,"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA",PULAU PENANG,"11800 GEORGETOWN, PULAU PENANG, 00000, MALAYSIA",,,978-967-394-206-0,,,,2014,,,,,,,111,118,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366474600015,0

We find that openness to experience is the most relevant personality trait in explaining wages, followed by neuroticism, agreeableness, extroversion and conscientiousness. Openness and extroversion are rewarded while agreeableness and neuroticism are penalized, but the openness pay gap is totally explained by differences in worker characteristics, particularly education and occupation.","[Nandi, Alita] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Nicoletti, Cheti] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Essex; University of York - UK,"Nandi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",anandi@essex.ac.uk,"Nicoletti, Cheti/J-8955-2019","Nicoletti, Cheti/0000-0002-7237-2597; NANDI, ALITA/0000-0002-8743-6178","ESRC [ES/H00811X/1, ES/L009153/1, ES/H029745/1, ES/K005146/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1, ES/H00811X/1, ES/K005146/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,44,19,22,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The univariate results attained from the stochastic convergence test provide that convergence does hold for sixteen countries except for Bulgaria and Ireland. In addition, the findings of the deterministic convergence test render the evidence favourable to convergence in sixteen EU countries as well, except for Austria and Greece. In other words, the individual results from panel stationarity tests are mostly in support of income convergence among EU members. Furthermore, both types of convergence appear to hold for the entire EU panel set.

One of these fields has focused on capital intensive (machinery) imports and its effect on manufacturing wages. The skill-enhancing-trade (SET) hypothesis was put forth to explain a potential relationship where an inflow of capital imports results in increased demand for skilled labour and decreased that of unskilled labour, and thus resulted in a rise in skilled wages and a decrease in their unskilled counterparts. This study revisits this hypothesis with a panel from the manufacturing sector of 57 nations. We improve upon previous studies in a number of ways. We add developed nations to the sample and examine capital imports from rich countries as well as the rest of the world. This takes into account the prominence of vertical production networks in international trade. We adhere closely to the neo-classical trade model and employ definitions of skilled and unskilled workers that capture the production process of particular items. Finally, we fit a robust dynamic panel data model that accounts for the endogeneity of the determinants of trade and wages. In this way we test whether the SET hypothesis is generally applicable as opposed to previous studies which use an ad hoc selection of countries and variables. We find that the SET hypothesis is not driving changes in manufacturing wages. Instead, worker productivity and GDP per capita explain these labour market outcomes.","[Posso, Alberto] RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Soans, Aaron] RMIT Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Posso, A (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",alberto.posso@rmit.edu.au,,"Posso, Alberto/0000-0003-4226-7072",,,,,25,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Entrepreneurs can either engage in costly search for projects and produce or become rent-seekers who collect rents for reversing redistribution. The model illustrates that redistribution of aggregate output is possible until a tipping point is reached. Higher levels of redistribution decrease entrepreneurship, employment, and aggregate income. Which level of redistribution is too much depends on the degree of inequality inherent in the firm quality distribution and on the power of rent-seekers to alter redistributive outcomes. An exogenous increase in the ratio of average realized output to output produced at the lowest-productivity firm reduces the gains from entrepreneurship relative to rent-seeking. This happens because entrepreneurs expend search costs to find those high-quality projects that drive up the average production value, but only a few entrepreneurs can realize these big hits. Wages and rent-seeker pay-offs, on the other hand, depend on average realized production. An increase in the power of rent-seekers further reduces the government's options. The model implies that the government's ability to redistribute might be declining when inequality rises.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Newark, NJ 07102 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Schwenkenberg, JM (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, 360 Dr Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",julia.schwenkenberg@rutgers.edu,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Our aim is to capture how the causation chain works through production networks and the triangular trade pattern. China is a production base and export center for Electronics, with a heavy dependence on East Asian Electronics supply. Meanwhile, the U.S. and the rest of the world (ROW) are important markets for Electronics exports. China collaborates with East Asia in the production networks but competes with East Asia for the exports to the U.S. and ROW. The shock of FDI reinforces the pivotal role of China and intensifies its exports without any remarkable change on the pattern of the geographical destination or origin of its Electronics exports and imports. The Chinese trade links and production division remain unchanged. However, China takes up more of the world market crowding out its competitors. In this sense, after the shock, the shares in imports of Electronics of rest of regions change noticeably, showing a remarkable increase in the weight of China. East Asia will increase its exports to China, providing more intermediates for further processing. However, it will be displaced by China in the rest of the markets, thus, reducing its overall exports. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using the European Social Survey, we first show that, on average, the religiosity of immigrants is greater than that of the native born and is greater than that of the stayers in the European origins, even among those who report they have no religious affiliation. Hypotheses are tested that can explain these observations. Differences in individual characteristics, such as age, education, income, marital status, and notably religious denominations, partly account for the overall differences. Religiosity of migrants declines with duration in the destination, approaching the levels of both the native born in destination countries and of the stayers in European origin countries. Both origin and destination country characteristics affect religiosity, such as economic development, religious pluralism, religious freedom, and societal attitudes towards religion, suggesting that both economic and culture persistence and adaptation take place.","[Aleksynska, Mariya] Int Labor Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Chiswick, Barry R.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Chiswick, Barry R.] Inst Study Labor, IZA, Bonn, Germany",George Washington University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Aleksynska, M (通讯作者)，Int Labor Org, Geneva, Switzerland.",maleksynska@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,17,17,0,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Graziani has always challenged the basic assumptions of orthodox theory by rejecting the initial definition of the economic and social world as being populated by identical individuals, where consumers are sovereign, technology is exogenous and money is neutral. Since the 1970s, Graziani's efforts have aimed at rebuilding on solid foundations the line of inquiry that sees capitalism as a 'monetary economy of production'. Authors such as Schumpeter and Keynes, and before them Wicksell and Marx, were all key influences on Graziani's work This theoretical attitude shaped Graziani's studies on the Italian economy within the European and the global landscapes. We are confronted here with an idea of state intervention where demand policies are not separated from supply-side policies, and are indeed embodied in a structural design to redefine the composition of production with great attention to the quality of labour. He reminds us that economic theory has to put at the heart of its discourse not the 'imperfections' of the market, but rather the 'normality' of power and conflict, not only between labour and capital, but also between fractions of capital, and between capitalisms.","Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Bellofiore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.",,,,,,,,8,7,7,0,5,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The procedure makes direct use of relationships that emerge from the model of cost minimization subject to producing a desired level of output. Based on an initial specification of constant cross-price derivatives, the imposition of adding up and symmetry conditions allows the actual price and coefficient changes that occur between periods to identify implicit own and cross-price derivatives and corresponding elasticities, using data for only two time periods. With this updated approach, the calculation of derivatives is far simpler and leads to far more accurate measures of price-induced input-output coefficient changes than the original version.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Econ, Meadville, PA 16335 USA",Allegheny College,"Casler, SD (通讯作者)，Allegheny Coll, Dept Econ, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",scasler@allegheny.edu,,,,,,,17,0,2,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We argue that the Gibson correlation is more accurately classified as a statistical artifact of commodity money systems, with the gold standard merely representing one such system. Using new evidence from Chinese monetary history, this article gives evidence that the Gibson paradox appeared during China's silver-cored metallic standard era.

Our Generalized Propensity Score estimation results suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between export intensity and productivity growth, which is consistent with Fryges and Wagner (2007). At the same time, we also find a similar pattern in the export intensity-markup nexus. Our results generally imply that increasing export intensity up to a certain threshold provides a better opportunity for exporters to improve productivity and charge higher markups than non-exporters, but a plant whose export intensity is beyond this threshold may not fully benefit from exporting activity as excessive exposure to foreign markets causes higher market uncertainties and internationalization costs.","[Choi, Yong-Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Lee, Siwook] Myongji Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 120728, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Myongji University,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Myongji Univ, Dept Econ, 34 Geobukgol Ro, Seoul 120728, South Korea.",choiy@khu.ac.kr; siwookl@mju.ac.kr,"Choi, Yong-Seok/AAH-9264-2020","Choi, Yong-Seok/0000-0002-9689-2335",,,,,32,1,1,1,18,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Connected authors and the determinants of book reviews,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Review,,,,,,Expert reviews; Conflict of interest; Information; Consumer reviews,BIAS,"This paper investigates the determinants of expert reviews in the book industry. Reviews are determined not only by the quality of the product but also by the incentives of the media outlet providing the review. For example, a media outlet may have the incentive to provide favorable coverage to certain authors or to slant reviews toward the horizontal preferences of certain readers. Empirically, we find that an author's connection to the media outlet is related to the outcome of the review decision. When a book's author also writes for a media outlet, that outlet is 25% more likely to review the book relative to other media outlets, and the resulting ratings are roughly 5% higher. Prima facie, it is unclear whether media outlets are favoring their own authors because these are the authors that their readers prefer or simply because they are trying to collude. We provide a test to distinguish between these two potential mechanisms, and present evidence that this is because of tastes rather than collusion - the effect of connections is present both for authors who began writing for a media outlet before and after the book release. We then investigate other determinants of expert reviews. Both consumers and expert reviewers seem to favor authors who have won book prizes. Yet relative to consumer reviews, professional critics are less favorable to first time authors and more favorable to authors who have garnered other attention in the press (as measured by number of media mentions outside of the review).

Our model works within monopolistically competitive loan and deposit markets and incorporates sweeping from deposit accounts to reserve-exempt accounts. Under unregulated deposit rates, we derive solutions for the market equilibrium values of the deposit rate and the share of deposits allocated to swept funds. Sweeping responds positively to the interbank loan rate and marginal resource costs for unswept funds, and negatively to the interest rate on reserves, reserve ratio, and the marginal resource cost of sweeping. The deposit rate responds positively to the interbank loan rate, interest rate on reserves, and reserve ratio, but negatively to marginal resource costs of sweeping and holding unswept funds. We also investigate deposit market equilibrium under a zero deposit rate restriction with sweeping. Here, the share of swept funds and the portion of the interbank rate passed on to swept balances adjust to attain market equilibrium. Sweeping enables banks to replicate outcomes from unhindered deposit rate competition. The equilibrium return that banks pay depositors and the share of swept funds are the same as with unrestricted deposit rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The replacement of GDP by a budgetary magnitude would strengthen guarantees of regional financial sustainability.

Using prefectural panel data, we estimate loan supply and demand functions and calculate their shifts. Our analysis reveals that demand-side effects contributed to the Japanese credit crunch to an equal or greater degree than supply-side effects. Further, we show that the credit crunch was not uniform across japan, but was more severe in urban relative to rural prefectures. These findings suggest that traditional countermeasures in the banking sector that similarly affect all prefectures may not induce economic recovery. Given this, we assert that region-specific policies may be more appropriate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the effect of uncertainty about the sustainable resource size on the outcome of this game. Assuming a general dynamic for resource deterioration, we study the effect of increased ambiguity (i.e., uncertain probabilities pertaining to the common resource's sustainable size).

Technological responsibility refers to the capacity of a sector or economic transaction between sectors to induce electricity consumption regardless of the final demand vector. Sectors with a high technological responsibility are those whose technologies use inputs which either directly or indirectly require much electricity independently of the composition of the final demand in the economy. This methodology is applied to the productive sectors of the Spanish economy. It is found out that a few transactions between sectors are highly technologically responsible regarding electricity consumption. The results show that, although the service sectors are the ones with the greatest share in electricity consumption, the industrial sectors (particularly, the extractive, heavy and energy industries), the electricity generation sector and construction are the ones with the greatest technological responsibility, i.e., they have technology mixes with a large propensity to consume electricity, propagating to the other sectors. The sectors with the highest technological responsibility are clustered around three broad sectors: energy, metal manufacturing and transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Blankart, CB",,,,"Blankart, Charles B.",,,Oil and Vinegar: A Positive Fiscal Theory of the Euro Crisis,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The theory of optimal currency areas states that a currency union may succeed if the participating countries have complementary industry structures. If this is not the case a currency union does not, inevitably, have to fail because market forces will induce adjustments of the industry structures that will eventually lead to a successful currency union. 33 This optimism is, however, not warranted for the euro. The euro has now been in a crisis for more than three years and a self-correcting mechanism leading out of the crisis is not in sight. The reason is that the euro union does not suffer from unadjusted industries, but from unadjusted governments. While industries adjust under the command of the invisible hand of the market in a currency union, this is not necessarily the case for governments. The general point of this paper is that countries with incompatible governments remain inimical in a currency union. They generate externalities and crises which cannot be eliminated as well in a political union. Assume that two countries traditionally cooperate in an economic union. Their governments are financially independent. They go Dutch. A currency union, such as the euro union, is different. It opens not only the option of a closer economic cooperation, but it also allows for a joint cash management so that each government has the temptation to live on the other's costs and hence to generate negative externalities on the other. The governments may be aware of this trap. They conclude a Treaty in order to prevent their mutually destructive behavior. But the Treaty turns out to be non-enforceable and therefore unable to stop the infringements by mutual externalities, this being the essence of the euro crisis. Therefore the governments should withdraw and return to an economic union without externalities.","[Blankart, Charles B.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Blankart, Charles B.] Univ Lucerne, Luzern, Switzerland; [Blankart, Charles B.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Blankart, Charles B.] CREMA, Basel, Switzerland",Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Lucerne; Ifo Institut,"Blankart, CB (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",charles@blankart.net,,,,,,,34,3,3,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2013,66,4,,,,,497,528,,,,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,VI4GV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000484790400002,0

I demonstrate that the reservation price is an important policy tool that may increase efficiency (or welfare) in multi-unit uniform-price auctions. I show that the higher the reservation price is, the higher is the seller's revenue and the higher is the efficiency of a final allocation of units that could be attained in a multi-unit uniform-price auction. The reservation price increases the bidder's equilibrium strategy in a specific way that is inherent to the uniform-price auction. Thus the reservation price effect on efficiency is in contrast to other auction formats; e.g., the reservation price decreases efficiency in the Vickrey auction and single-unit auctions with symmetric bidders. Therefore the main result can be added to the list of results from mechanism design and auction theory that fail to extend the single-unit/single-dimensional context to the multi-unit/multi-dimensional one.

The model predicts that a government would set a high tariff rate if an industry is of large state-owned enterprise (SOE) share, multinational share, or small foreign import share. From the model we reveal the Chinese government's preference towards different interest groups under the binding tariff constraint from the WTO commitments. The estimated structural parameters imply that the political weights on both the SOE profits and consumer income diminish with the economic opening. More important, the government still favours SOEs over consumer income.

The present paper examines its performance in three Indian states Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, based on primary data collected for this study. As real income transfers through food price subsidies are a tiny fraction of expenditure per person under this scheme, a contribution of the present study is to model determinants of real income transfers through subsidised wheat, rice and sugar. The analysis throws new light on how income transfers vary with economic status of a household, inequality in the distribution of land in a village, amount of food price subsidy, transaction costs of buying from 'fair price shops' (FPS), and supply shortages. The policy implications of these results are profound. Desperate measures such as a universal food subsidy enshrined in a proposed National Food Security Act are rejected on the grounds that the enormous leakages and wastage under the present TPDS would only get worse. Assertions that a universal food subsidy is the only option consistent with the right to food are rejected as mistaken. Instead, it is worthwhile to overhaul the PDS within the existing outlay.

Subjects in the control group were given hypothetical returns for both the risk-free and the risky asset. Subjects in the account group were also given information about returns separately for each of the two assets. However, this information was scaled according to a subject's chosen investment amount. Subjects in the portfolio group could observe returns on a portfolio level, which constitutes the highest level of information aggregation in our study. Results show that a higher degree of information aggregation results in greater risk-taking. Increased risk-taking is associated with a lower risk perception and a more accurate estimation of the probability of a loss. Furthermore, reporting aggregated returns might lead investors to evaluate the aggregated outcome relative to a different reference point (the overall portfolio instead of the amount invested in risky assets), which makes them less likely to experience a loss and therefore increases the willingness to invest in the risky asset. Thus, aggregating information seems to reduce mental accounting, namely having one account for risky and one account for risk-free investments. Ex post, our findings show that the portfolio group also makes consistent subsequent allocation decisions and shows a lower dissatisfaction with outcomes in the loss domain. The results were consistent across both experiments despite the use of different subject pools and investment amounts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate what happens beyond first order by viewing payoffs as higher order forces of change, specifying e.g. the acceleration of the players' evolution instead of its velocity (a viewpoint which emerges naturally when it comes to aggregating empirical data of past instances of play). To that end, we derive a wide class of higher order game dynamics, generalizing first order imitative dynamics, and, in particular, the replicator dynamics. We show that strictly dominated strategies become extinct in n-th order payoff-monotonic dynamics n orders as fast as in the corresponding first order dynamics; furthermore, in stark contrast to first order, weakly dominated strategies also become extinct for n >= 2. All in all, higher order payoff-monotonic dynamics lead to the elimination of weakly dominated strategies, followed by the iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies, thus providing a dynamic justification of the well-known epistemic rationalizability process of Dekel and Fudenberg [7]. Finally, we also establish a higher order analogue of the folk theorem of evolutionary game theory, and we show that convergence to strict equilibria in n-th order dynamics is n orders as fast as in first order.

The simulation results show that, the efficacy of physical capital accumulation in augmenting growth and abating income inequality is greater than that of human capital accumulation. In the long term, however, the latter overtakes the former in promoting growth, but inequality worsens. When the two policies are commingled, growth improves but it continues to be inequality-augmenting. Finally, with concomitant Hicks-neutral technological progress, not only is growth enhanced further, but it turns out to be significantly inequality-mitigating. The emerging policy lesson is that any integrated policy of boosting investments in physical as well as human capital must be closely bound up with technological progress for growth to be inclusive.

This allows us to evaluate the efficacy of CBDT as an account of human decision-making on this set of problems. We find: (1) The choice behavior of this program (and therefore case-based decision theory) correctly predicts the empirically observed relative difficulty of problems and speed of learning in human data. (2) 'Similarity' (how CBDT decision makers extrapolate from memory) is decreasing in vector distance, consistent with evidence in psychology (Shepard, 1987).

In financial markets, they can be used to explain well known features called stylised facts and fit statistical properties of data.

However, calibrating such models is not yet sufficiently considered in the literature. In this paper, a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm coupled with threshold accepting algorithm (Gilli and Winker in Comput Stat Data Anal 42:299-312, 2003) and a genetic algorithm have been implemented to calibrate the model presented by Farmer and Joshi (J Econ Behav Org 49:149-171, 2002) and the outcomes have been compared and discussed.

In particular, I look at the tradeoff between different types of private security measures such as using or carrying guns, carrying less cash or keeping less valuables at home, and using burglar alarms or Lojack - and study how this tradeoff is affected by changes in public security. If private householders' direct security expenses are strongly substitutable with public policing (e.g., for guns which may be more useful in badly policed areas), an increase in policing results in a drop in these expenses; it also results in carrying or keeping less cash (an indirect security measure which reduces the prize a criminal can seize). If, however, householders' direct security expenses are complementary to policing in the sense that they are more effective when police response is rapid (e.g., for burglar alarms), more policing increases these expenses unless the efficacy of joint (public and private) security expenses on combating crime encounters very sharply diminishing returns; moreover, a rise in policing also induces carrying or keeping more cash. An increase in penalties increases the tendency to keep cash on hand, and also reduces crime, provided that as private precautions increase, with policing constant, it takes a larger increment in security spending to compensate for a specific drop in penalties. The results are consistent with some empirical trends in crime rates, policing, penalties and private precautions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It affects the cyclical dynamics of the surplus division between workers and firms, and provides a better characterization of the movements in income shares over recessions and expansions.

Customers in a restaurant in tables of one or two diners who paid with cash received excessive change of either 10 or 40 Shekels (about $3 or $12). A majority of customers (128 out of 192) did not return the excessive change. Repeated customers returned the excessive change much more often than one-time customers. Women returned the extra change much more often than men, especially among repeated customers. Interestingly, a table with a woman and a man behaves similarly to one or two males and not to a female table. Surprisingly, tables with two diners were not significantly more likely to return the excessive change. Customers receiving 10 extra Shekels were much less likely to return them than those who received 40 extra Shekels, but it is hard to know to what extent this comes from intentional behavior versus lower likelihood to observe the extra change when it is lower.

In particular, we evaluate the productive effect of public capital by estimating various production functions on a panel of 21 OECD countries over the period 1975-2002. Our results suggest that public capital has a positive long run impact on output, with elasticities that range between 0.05 and 0.15, depending on model specification. These findings are robust to the existence of spillover effects from public capital investments in other countries and to the inclusion of other productivity determinants, like human capital, the stock of patents and R&D capital. Finally, we do not find any important effect of public capital on GDP in the short run: this suggests that public infrastructure investments might not be a powerful countercyclical policy instrument.

This study aims at investigating the impact of carbon tax levy on carbon dioxide (CO2) abatement and industrial growth in China. To this end, the marginal abatement cost (MAC) of industrial CO2 emissions is estimated as the benchmark of setting the carbon tax rate by using the directional distance function (DDF). This paper employs the polynomial dynamic panel model to forecast the impact of carbon tax levy on target variables such as sectoral value-added and CO2 intensity. The results reveal that the levy of a CO2 tax has a negative impact on industrial output only in the short term. In the long term, the impact of CO2 tax levy on output will become positive. The levy of a CO2 tax is always beneficial to reduce CO2 intensity. Corresponding policy suggestions for an environmental taxation system reform are given in the concluding section.

International hedonic pricing studies conducted have, however, produced mixed results with some concluding that social housing developments may in fact lead to an improvement in surrounding property values. There is, however, a paucity of South African evidence. This study considers the validity of the most pervasive NIMBY argument, the claim that social housing developments negatively affect nearby property values, by considering the property prices of 170 single-family homes in the Walmer neighbourhood, Nelson Mandela Bay, as a function of their proximity to an existing low-cost housing development. The results of this study indicate that in the case of one Nelson Mandela Bay low-cost housing development, a negative impact is exerted on the property values of nearby houses.","[Du Preez, Mario; Sale, Michael] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Econ, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Sale, M (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Econ, POB 77000, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",michael.sale@nmmu.ac.za,,,,,,,41,5,5,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Recent empirical literature identifies two groups of evidence - the product lines evidence on different export strategies and sources of competitiveness across product groups and countries, and the aggregate trade flows evidence on a positive relation between the income per capita and both export and import prices (also conditional on the exporter). We attempt to provide a theoretical background for these findings and focus on the North-South productivity differences in a four country North-South trade model with two dimensions of firm heterogeneity. Differences in the firms' product quality and cost efficiency impose different competitiveness sources when entering more difficult markets and result in the observed export and import prices and consumption bundles across the rich and poor countries.

El Paso is one of the largest metropolitan economies in the USA located directly adjacent to an international boundary with another country.

Usually they are operated by monopoly governments for profit. Therefore, lotto demand modeling typically evaluates whether estimated effective price (expected loss from buying one ticket) elasticity is consistent with net revenue maximization. Here we use data from several lotto games in Spain to estimate own-price elasticities. Results imply that games are under-priced if net revenue maximization is the goal suggesting that an increase in the (atypically low) takeout rate is one possible way of raising lottery revenues. The paper also analyses the impact of the popular Christmas Draw of the Spanish National Lottery (a passive lottery which is expected to be a potential rival of lotto games) as well as the seasonal pattern of lotto consumption in Spain.","[Garcia, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez, Levi; Rodriguez, Placido] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; University of Oviedo,"García, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Pérez, Levi/L-6919-2015; Villar, Jaume Garcia/D-7140-2013","Pérez, Levi/0000-0001-6632-6626;",,,,,29,1,1,0,6,UNIV ZARAGOZA,ZARAGOZA,"DEPT ESTRUCTURA ECONOMICA ECONOMIA PUBLICA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

The objective of this paper is to fill the gap in the literature regarding outward foreign direct investment by adopting the well known gravity model to examine the relationship between trade (export and import), inward and outward FDI using Malaysia as a case. This contributes to the literature as previous studies on OFDI in Malaysia have focused primarily on the determinants of these outward flows, and there are no studies examining the impact of OFDI on trade. Based on Hausman-Taylor estimation method, our findings reveal that inward foreign direct investment (IFDI) conforms to the observed pattern of a complementary relationship between FDI and trade, while OFDI and trade linkages are not significant as OFDI is dominated by the services sector, which generally is non-tradable. However, intra-firm trade in services could be increased through the process of fragmentation or outsourcing. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We used 66 separate surveys that ask respondents, from an opt-in web panel, sequences of preference questions about consumer products to study design factors that influence the rate of completing the entire sequence of questions comprising a discrete choice experiment. We do this by systematically varying the number of choice sets, the number of alternatives respondents were asked to consider, the nature of the list of attributes of each alternative and the type of statistical design. Completion rates systematically varied with the factors explored, but perhaps the key finding is that completion rates are reasonably high in all cases. We found that completion rates are relatively unaffected by asking more questions (choice sets), but they decline as one includes more alternatives. Expected time to complete a survey often plays a key role in the cost of web-based panels, so we also look at how the preceding factors impact completion times.

The research was conducted using the questionnaire method on a sample of 1000 respondents in Croatia. The results were processed using am ultivariate statistic that is used for the factor and descriptive inferential statistical analysis. Statistics showed the causes of consumer ethnocentrism to be psychological, associated with the structure of consumer's social environment which cannot develop in isolation but as part of a set of socio-psychological, economic, political and demographic influences. As a result, consumer's ethnocentrism cannot be fully identified only assumed. Consumer's ethnocentrism will depend on country, values, customs and behavioral patterns. The statistical analysis concluded regardless of gender the consumer who is expressing high ethnocentric tendencies would be older, less educated, with low income, highly religious and is dissatisfied with their life in Croatia.","Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",University of Dubrovnik,"Matic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Dubrovnik, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",matea.matic@unidu.hr,,,,,,,37,6,7,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The results illustrate that the Student-t dependence only shows better explanatory power than the Gaussian dependence structure and the persistence pertaining to the dependence structure between rubber futures returns in AFET and oil futures returns, namely, crude oil futures returns and gas oil futures returns in TOCOM. Whereas, the Gaussian dependence shows better explanatory ability between rubber futures returns in AFET and other rubber futures returns, namely, the volatility of rubber futures in SICOM and TOCOM. For the multivariate Copula model, all the parameters between AFET and other variables are significant. Based on these results, with the liberalization of agricultural trade and the withdrawal of government support to agricultural producers, there is in many countries a new need for price discovery and even physical trading mechanisms, a need that can often be met by commodity futures exchanges. Hence, this paper recommends that the government supports the hedge mutual funds that can be invested in every commodities futures exchange in the world. It can also put the funds together that will contribute farmers to invest in each commodities futures market. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Dictators choosing selfishly via an intermediary are punished less and earn greater profits than those who do so directly. Despite being powerless to influence the fairness of the outcome, an intermediary given the choice between two unfair outcomes is punished more than when the dictator chooses one directly. This is not the case when the intermediary merely can initiate the random selection of one of the outcomes.

This eased access to markets and capital but also revealed many weaknesses in Albanian corporations. Today the country's growth strategy is based on exports. Consequently, a strong and competitive corporate sector with international potential is vital. Following the evolutionary approach in corporate governance theory, we examine internal organisation of the firm, relationships between stakeholders and Albania's historical legacy (path dependency), linking these characteristics with competitiveness and export orientation. Cluster analysis reveals two distinct groups, where cooperation between agents and human capital investment, as well as productivity and export orientation, differ significantly. In terms of development policy, the results are very important for Albania and similar countries.

This phenomenon whereby previously integrated productive activities are segmented and internationally spread is reflected in the rapid increase in parts and components trade, growing at higher rates than final goods trade. In this process the Western Balkan countries (WBC) have been no exception. With their recent integration into global markets, the WBC have witnessed growth in parts and components trade that has even exceeded the world average. This article examines the determinants of the trade that stems from the international fragmentation of production in the WBC. Using a panel data set of disaggregated bilateral trade flows, we estimate gravity equations for 2000-2009. Our findings support the hypothesis drawn from the theory of fragmentation that trade in parts and components is motivated by labour cost differences and by geographical and proximity reasons. The relevance of additional service link costs, as well as the influence of institutional similarity and infrastructure quality or political-economic agreements is also confirmed by our empirical research.","[Shimbov, Bojan] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Shimbov, Bojan; Alguacil, Maite; Suarez, Celestino] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",The World Bank; Universitat Jaume I,"Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",alguacil@uji.es,"Shimbov, Bojan/ABF-6738-2021; Alguacil, Maite/AAA-2338-2019; Suarez, Celestino/AAA-2446-2019; Alguacil, Maite/K-9815-2014","Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170; Suarez, Celestino/0000-0002-3039-6240; Alguacil, Maite/0000-0002-6501-9170",,,,,42,9,9,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP 1,2013,25,3,,,,,371,391,,10.1080/14631377.2013.813142,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,205XT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000323478800007,0

One emerging issue is the possibility of strategic behavior in the renewable energy certificate/credit (REC) market, and its spillover effects on the electricity market. This paper develops dominant firm-competitive fringe models that account for market power. We show that market power could have significant impacts on the REC and power prices. In particular, when a nonrenewable generator is a dominant firm and a renewable generator is a competitive fringe, the nonrenewable firm has a strong incentive to lower the REC price, even to zero for avoiding REC costs. The zero REC price would negate price impacts in the power market, thereby mitigating market power of the dominant firm. However, this could lead to an under-investment in renewables in the long run as subsidies received by renewables in form of RECs vanish. Therefore, regulatory agencies need to carefully oversee the market performance to ensure a healthy development of renewable industries under the RPS policies. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First, foreign sectors play an important role in influencing macroeconomic variables of each of the ASEAN-3 country, especially in the medium and the long-run horizon.

As international competition continues to intensify, some companies and researchers have taken a profound interest in the social cognitions, reactions, backgrounds, and behaviors of members in organizations. In line with these tendencies, organizational culture, along with absorptive capacity, is becoming one of the decisive factors. This study aims to use empirical analysis to identify the relationships between organizational culture, absorptive capacity, and performance of international logistics service providers (ILSP) in Korea. The empirical research shows that (1) there is no direct relationship between the construct of power distance and performance; (2) absorptive capacity has no mediation effect on the relationship between the construct of uncertainty avoidance and business performance; (3) in the case of the constructs of masculinity and femininity and individualism and collectivism, there is a full mediation effect only on financial performance; (4) there is partial mediation between long-term orientation and non-financial performance. Overall, the results of this study suggest that managers of ILSP should bear in mind that the constructs of organizational culture have considerable influence over an organization's absorptive capacity and business performance. These firms should acknowledge these influences and apply appropriate strategies, focusing on known weaknesses, to effectively strengthen their competitive market positions and long-term survival and success.","[Cho, Sung-woo] Kunsan Natl Univ, Gunsan 573701, South Korea; [Pak, Myong-sop] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Hur, Yun-seok] N Dakota State Univ, Dept 7610, Ctr Agr Policy & Trade Studies, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Lee, Jae-sung] Inha Univ, Asia Pacific Sch Logist, Inchon 402751, South Korea",Kunsan National University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); North Dakota State University Fargo; Inha University,"Pak, MS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Business, 33523 Business Sch Bldg,53 Myeongnyun Dong,3-Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",swcho@kunsan.ac.kr; mspak@skku.edu; lung79@naver.com; js010812@hanmail.net,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,35,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

In addition, in this tourism-led growth literature it is not clear whether human capital plays a role. Using a panel of 72 countries (1980-2005) this study shed new light on the effect of tourism and human capital for economic growth. While our results confirm that the tourism sector indicator is always positive and significant in growth regressions they also show that increased education contributes to growth and that the role of the tourism sector is significantly larger in countries with higher aggregate levels of human capital. Our main results are robust to the inclusion of additional variables, the use of alternative estimators in the regression analysis and the use of different sub-samples. Overall, our results suggest that an increase in human capital endowments is always beneficial, even when the development strategy focuses on the expansion of a (successful) unskilled sector.","[Di Liberto, Adriana] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; [Di Liberto, Adriana] CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Cagliari,"Di Liberto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.",diliberto@unica.it,,,,,,,59,8,8,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

These econometric models involve polar assumptions as regards the similarity of the different locations. Schmidheiny and Brulhart (2011) reconcile these polar cases by introducing a fixed outside option transforming the conditional logit into a nested logit framework. This gives rise to a dissimilarity parameter (lambda is an element of [0; 1]) equalling 1 in Poisson regressions (with completely dissimilar locations) and 0 in conditional logit models (with completely similar locations). The dissimilarity parameter is not identified in Schmidheiny and Brulhart (2011).

If the ordinal judgments are strict, the scoring rule is incentive compatible for expected utility maximizers as long utility is increasing in wealth. When allowing for non-strict judgments, the scoring rule is no longer incentive compatible for all expected utility maximizers, but still incentive compatible for expected value maximizers. In both cases the scoring rule fulfills the Relevance Principle and is thus simple to implement experimentally. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explicitly investigates the presence of a structural break that occurred at unknown dates across countries and which may have been caused by the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. To identify which of the ten countries hold real exchange rate stationarity, that is, long-run Purchasing Power Parity, the resampling-based multiple testing proposed by Romano and Wolf (2005) is employed while dealing with possible cross-sectional correlation among the countries and avoiding the over-rejection of the null hypothesis or the multiplicity problem. Moreover, the paper examines the small-sample property of the multiple testing when there is a structural break in cross-sectionally dependent panels. Finally, the empirical results show that the stationarity hypothesis of the real exchange rate is significantly supported in some Asian countries. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

To assess such phenomena empirically, we employ a multi-regime vector autoregression (MRVAR) approach rather than conventional linear vector autoregressions. We conduct bivariate empirical analyses, using country-specific financial-stress indices and industrial production, for the U.S., the UK and the four large euro-area countries. Our MRVAR-based impulse-response studies demonstrate that, compared to a linear specification, response profiles are dependent on the current state of the economy as well as the sign and size of shocks. Previous multi-regime-based studies, focusing solely on the regime-dependence of responses, conclude that, during a high-stress period, stress-increasing shocks have more dramatic consequences for economic activity than during low stress. Conducting size-dependent response analysis, we find that this holds only for small shocks and reverses when shocks become sufficiently large to induce immediate regime switches. Our findings also suggest that, in states of high financial stress, large negative shocks to financial-stress have sizeable positive effects on real activity and support the idea of unconventional monetary policy measures in cases of extreme financial stress.

We show that the signaling model of conspicuous consumption predicts that a consumer's well-being should increase based on his or her household's ranking of observable consumption within its reference group, but should not be affected by its ranking in the distribution of unobservable consumption. We test this prediction using panel data on household expenditure and subjective well-being. Our evidence is consistent with the predictions of the signaling model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To measure the size of the banking system a country's banking assets divided by the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is commonly applied as a general yardstick.

In a cross-country empirical study, we find a statistically significant relationship between the presence of large banks and the presence of multinationals, after controlling for the size of the country.

The reform considered consists of eliminating the capital tax alongside a concurrent rise in the labour tax. In contrast to the perfectly competitive model, models with product or labour market failures each result in welfare losses for the workers in the long-run. In a realistic calibration to the UK economy, combining these imperfections implies that this tax reform will be Pareto improving in the long-run. However, these welfare gains over longer time horizons come at the cost of short-run losses, which, consistent with previous research, result in welfare losses for workers post-reform.

Agents may evade taxes by working in the informal sector, but they are detected with positive probability. Workers are rewarded with government benefits that are proportional to formal (taxed) work. When enforcement is imperfect and collecting taxes is costly, the optimal inflation rate is positive and inflation becomes a second-best tax. Deviations from the Friedman rule are optimal and depend on the tax enforcement policies. Using U.S. data, we compute the quantitative effect of different tax structures on inflation and interest rate. We show that different tax enforcement and government spending (benefits) policies induce different optimal outcomes for inflation and interest rates.","[Arbex, Marcelo] Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",University of Windsor,"Arbex, M (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",arbex@uwindsor.ca,"Arbex, Marcelo/ABC-2901-2020","ARBEX, MARCELO/0000-0002-5506-2669",,,,,39,3,3,1,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The view is widespread that moving towards a fiscal union' would have stabilizing effects in case of macroeconomic shocks. We study the economic effects of introducing two elements of a fiscal union: an EU-wide tax and transfer system and a fiscal equalization mechanism. Using the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD, we exploit representative household micro data from 11 eurozone countries to simulate these policy reforms and study their effects on the income distribution and automatic stabilizers. We find that replacing one third of the national tax-benefit systems with a European system would lead to significant redistributive effects both within and across countries. These effects depend on income levels and the structures of existing national systems. The EU system would particularly improve fiscal stabilization in credit constrained countries absorbing 10-15% of a macroeconomic income shock. Introducing a fiscal equalization mechanism would redistribute revenues from high to low income countries. However, the stabilization properties of this system are ambiguous. The results suggest that it might be necessary for Europe to explore alternative ways of improving macroeconomic stability without redistributing income ex ante.

Our results are broadly in line with theoretical predictions. When players can vote on the behavior of the whole group or when leaders from each group can vote for the group as a whole, extraction levels from the common resource pool are close to the social optimum. When players extract resources individually, there is substantial overextraction. When players vote in subgroups, there is initially less overextraction but it increases over time. This suggests that in order for binding voting to overcome the tragedy of the commons in social dilemmas, it should ideally affect the group as a whole. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the UK, the share of firms patenting among those reporting that they have innovated is about 4%. Survey data from the same firms support the idea that they do not consider patents or other forms of registered IP as important as informal IP for protecting inventions. We show that there are a number of explanations for these findings: most firms are SMEs, many innovations are new to the firm, but not to the market, and many sectors are not patent active. We find evidence pointing to a positive association between patenting and innovative performance measured as turnover due to innovation, but not between patenting and subsequent employment growth. The analysis relies on a new integrated dataset for the UK that combines a range of data sources into a panel at the enterprise level.","[Hall, Bronwyn H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Helmers, Christian] Univ Carlos III Madrid, SERC LSE, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Rogers, Mark] Univ Oxford, Harris Manchester Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Sena, Vania] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Maastricht University; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Oxford; University of Essex,"Hall, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bhhall@econ.berkeley.edu,"Hall, Bronwyn/JFK-7284-2023","Hall, Bronwyn Hughes/0000-0002-3802-5567",,,,,18,66,70,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The ARDL bound testing cointegration confirms the significant positive relationship between terms of trade and economic growth in the long run as well as in the short run. Results of Granger causality, Toda and Yamamoto Modified Wald causality and variance decomposition tests confirm the bidirectional causal relationship between terms of trade and economic growth in India. Rolling window estimation indicates that the terms of trade is having positive long-run coefficients throughout the sample period. Results of CUSUM and CUSUM of square suggest that there is no structural instability in the residuals of equation of economic growth in short run. It is suggested that beneficial terms of trade is better for economic growth in India. At this stage we can set the direction of future research that the relationship between commodity groupwise and countrywise bilateral terms of trade with economic growth should be analyzed.

Which component contributes more to the welfare outcome of the reform?

We replicate the key features of the current health insurance system in the U.S. and calibrate the model using the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey dataset. We find that the reform decreases the number of uninsured more than twice and generates substantial welfare gains.

It is shown that the optimistic manager trades a larger quantity of the risky asset and thus takes more risk than the rational manager. Managerial optimism bias can offset her risk aversion and increase the investor's wealth by reducing moral hazard between the investor and the manager. Furthermore, a pronounced optimism bias reduces the incentive component of the incentive contract, suggesting that an optimistic manager requires fewer incentives to align her decisions with the interests of the investor.

Economic analysis of this hypothesis yields mixed results. This paper investigates the impact of FDI on local education expenditures both theoretically and empirically. The theoretical model shows an ambiguous impact of FDI on local expenditures for education. Empirically using US state-level data from 1991 to 2000 and the system-GMM estimator that controls for fixed effects, times series issues and endogeneity, I find evidence that FDI is positively correlated with increased expenditures on education.","Indiana Univ, Sch Business & Econ, South Bend, IN 46634 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University South Bend,"Zhuang, H (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Business & Econ, 1700 Mishawaka Ave, South Bend, IN 46634 USA.",zhuangh@iusb.edu,"Zhuang, Hong/HMD-3633-2023",,,,,,29,6,7,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

One important part of the financial system is the interbank payment system. This paper develops a robust measure, SinkRank, that accurately predicts the magnitude of disruption caused by the failure of a bank in a payment system and identifies banks most affected by the failure. SinkRank is based on absorbing Markov chains, which are well-suited to model liquidity dynamics in payment systems. Because actual bank failures are rare and the data is not generally publicly available, the authors test the metric by simulating payment networks and inducing failures in them. They test SinkRank on several types of payment networks, including Barabasi-Albert types of scale-free networks modeled on the Fedwire system, and find that the failing bank's SinkRank is highly correlated with the resulting disruption in the system overall; moreover, the SinkRank algorithm can identify which individual banks would be most disrupted by a given failure.",,,,kimmo@soramaki.net,,,,,,,29,27,29,2,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 25,2013,7,,,,,,,,201328.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-28,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185KT,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321967300001,0

While other English-speaking countries have also experienced sharp increases in the top 1 percent income share, many high-income countries such as Japan, France, or Germany have seen much less increase in top income shares. Hence, the explanation cannot rely solely on forces common to advanced countries, such as the impact of new technologies and globalization on the supply and demand for skills. Moreover, the explanations have to accommodate the falls in top income shares earlier in the twentieth century experienced in virtually all high-income countries. We highlight four main factors. The first is the impact of tax policy, which has varied over time and differs across countries. Top tax rates have moved in the opposite direction from top income shares. The effects of top rate cuts can operate in conjunction with other mechanisms. The second factor is a richer view of the labor market, where we contrast the standard supply-side model with one where pay is determined by bargaining and the reactions to top rate cuts may lead simply to a redistribution of surplus. Indeed, top rate cuts may lead managerial energies to be diverted to increasing their remuneration at the expense of enterprise growth and employment. The third factor is capital income. Overall, private wealth (relative to income) has followed a U-shaped path over time, particularly in Europe, where inherited wealth is, in Europe if not in the United States, making a return. The fourth, little investigated, element is the correlation between earned income and capital income, which has substantially increased in recent decades in the United States.","[Alvaredo, Facundo; Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Alvaredo, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] London Sch Econ, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Piketty, Thomas] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Oxford; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Paris School of Economics; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Alvaredo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",alvaredo@gmail.com; tony.atkinson@nuffield.ox.ac.uk; piketty@ens.fr; saez@econ.berkeley.edu,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019",,ESRC [ES/I033114/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I033114/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,34,340,390,8,157,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

While earlier literature on the relationship between competition and hospital quality mainly focused on outcome indicators, we argue that the inclusion of process indicators in the analysis can provide supplementary information about the effect of competitive pressure on hospitals' incentives. In particular, these indicators are less noisy than outcome indicators and are important as a management tool. Our panel dataset covers all Dutch general and academic hospitals in the period 2004-2008, during which the transparency of hospital quality information increased substantially due to the disclosure of hospitals' quality indicators. We find that competition among hospitals located within the hospital catchment area explains differences in several process indicators, but fails to explain differences in outcome indicators. The results suggest that hospitals facing more competition organize diagnostic processes more efficiently; however, they have more operation cancellations at short notice and more delays of hip fracture injury operations for elderly patients. This suggests that competition affects the allocation of hospital personnel efforts even when outcomes have not been affected.","[Bijlsma, Michiel J.; Shestalova, Victoria] Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre W.

The evidence reveals patterns of interaction between the macro-economy and exchange rate variability. Across developing countries, appreciation decreases the cost of imports and price inflation, while depreciation shrinks the output supply, indicating high dependency on imported goods. The reduction in output supply correlates with higher inflation and an increase in the import value. In contrast, the evidence of the negative effect of currency appreciation on output growth is more prevalent across advanced countries, while depreciation stimulates competitiveness, resulting in higher demand for exports, investment and consumption. Across developing countries, exchange rate variability decreases trend real growth and increases trend price inflation. Across advanced countries, exchange rate variability decreases trend real growth while increasing the variability of price inflation and import growth. Minimizing variability of the exchange rate would be beneficial to sustain higher growth and reduce cyclical variability in developing and advanced countries.","Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Western Hemisphere Dept, 700,19th St,NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",MKandil@imf.org,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

However, weekends may affect asset prices through time discounting as well as through shocks/news occurring on weekends. In this regard, we suggest a test for the TTH by using an AR (1) model, where many asset prices are closely approximated by an AR(1) process. The proposing test statistics are based upon the differences of AR coefficients and error variances between Monday and the other weekdays. Asymptotic normality of the suggested test statistics under the TTH and model stationarity is proved. Under the model of nonstationarity, the test statistic is asymptotically pivotal/non-standard and the critical values are given from the Monte Carlo simulations. In an application for the United States S&P 500 data during the years 2000-2011, we found that the TTH was rejected, particularly during the years of war and financial crisis. We also confirmed a weakening of the weekend effect as depicted in Chow, Hsiao and Solt (2003), and Connolly's (1989) results. It requires us to revise the dynamic analyses using a time series model of asset prices considering the weekends.","Dankook Univ, Sch Econ, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Kim, YY (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Sch Econ, 126 Jukjeon Dong, Yongin 448701, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",yunyeongkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,10,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The balanced growth path emerges as a special (and testable) case of our framework, as do existing strands of medium-run debates.","[McAdam, Peter; Willman, Alpo] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [McAdam, Peter] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",European Central Bank; University of Surrey,"McAdam, P (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Res Dept, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,62,32,33,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We introduce a simple model to study institution formation as a second-order cooperation problem where voluntary contributions to a common fund serve as an instrument to finance centralized sanctioning institutions. Our model illustrates how self-interested motivations may lead to the voluntary formation of centralized sanctioning institutions in equilibrium. Our experimental results show that in practise human readiness to cooperate among unrelated individuals may give rise to socially wasteful sanctioning mechanisms. Our results indicate that inefficient institutions emerge due to heterogeneous perceptions pertaining to the sufficiently high level of forfeiture. Our results suggest that opportunities to choose between different sanctioning schemes and waive rights to sue may improve the match between preferences and desired institutional environment.

Experimental industrial organization, therefore, faces a problem: How can firms be brought into the laboratory? The main approach relies on framing: Call individuals firms! This experimental approach is not in line with modern industrial organization, according to which a firm's market behavior is also determined by its organizational structure. In this paper, a Stackelberg experiment is considered in order to answer the question whether framing individual decision making as firm decision making or implementing an organizational structure is more effective for generating profit-maximizing behavior. Firms are either represented by individuals or by teams. Teams are organized according to a parsimonious version of Alchian and Demsetz's (Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization, 1972) contractual model of the firm. The author finds teams' quantity choices are more in line with the assumption of profit maximization than individuals' choices. Compared to individuals, teams appear to be less inequality averse.","Univ Giessen, Inst Farm & Agribusiness Management, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Hildenbrand, A (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Farm & Agribusiness Management, Giessen, Germany.",andreas.hildenbrand@agrar.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,10,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 8,2013,7,,,,,,,,201320.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-20,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,185JQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000321964300002,0

The index is asymptotically Normal, consequently permitting inference. To demonstrate its use, the paper examines the effect the One Child Policy had on matching patterns in the marriage market in China. To distinguish between confounding policies of the period, a static general equilibrium model is introduced. It predicts that constraining marital output in the child quantity dimension may raise the marginal benefit of positive assortative matching and investment in child quality, thereby increasing the intensity with which they are pursued and concomitantly reducing the marriage rate. Upon verifying that the policy was binding via a Poisson model, using the matching index, significant support for increases in positive assortative matching and reductions in negative assortative matching were found.

The model is solved for optimal policy, and welfare implications of three alternative monetary policy regimes under this optimal policy are compared when there is a cost-push shock to the economy. These monetary policy regimes are the unconstrained policy, price-level targeting and inflation targeting regimes. The results illustrate that optimal policy depends on the degree of price stickiness and the persistence of the shock. Inflation targeting emerges as the optimal policy if prices are flexible enough or the shock is persistent enough. However, the unconstrained policy or price-level targeting might be preferable to inflation targeting if prices are not very flexible and the shock is not very persistent. The results also show that as prices become more flexible, the welfare loss usually gets bigger.","[Arslan, M.

It is postulated that these coefficients are positive between future values of the trade balance and current exchange rate, but negative between past values of the trade balance and the current exchange rate, hence the S-Curve pattern. Previous research has shown that the curve is not supported for Mexico when aggregate trade data are used. In this paper we used bilateral trade data between Mexico and her main partner, the United States to test the curve. Still there was no support for the curve.

A higher oil price not only leads to higher economic growth and savings in the sovereign wealth fund, but also induces a rupture in the Russian economy. Public spending and household spending increase while the traditional export industries suffer from real appreciation, in line with the Dutch disease hypothesis.

Using an extended gravity panel data model, econometric results corroborate that EU membership and comparative advantages are key determining factors to being integrated in cross-border production networks.

We derive the static and dynamic optimal level of specialization under the centralized and the decentralized economy. We identify the conditions under which the socially optimal specialization level entails positive investment in the comparatively disadvantaged sector. We show that in this case the socially optimal solution cannot be reached by the decentralized economy which is in fact characterized by over-specialization. We conclude presenting a simple tax-based redistributive mechanism able to achieve the optimal level of specialization in a decentralized economic system.,"[Di Maio, Michele] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dipartimento Studi Econ, I-80133 Neaples, Italy; [Valente, Marco] Univ Aquila, Fac Econ, Pisa, Italy; LEM, Pisa, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; University of L'Aquila,"Di Maio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dipartimento Studi Econ, Via Medina 40, I-80133 Neaples, Italy.",michele.dimaio@uniparthenope.it; marco.valente@univaq.it,"Valente, Marco/G-8781-2012","Valente, Marco/0000-0001-5378-4898; Di Maio, Michele/0000-0003-2622-6780",,,,,41,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2013,64,2,,,,,215,243,,10.1111/meca.12003,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,117RB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000316969700001,0

Individuals belong to two separate and identifiable groups. We say that the contest is discriminatory if a lower share of prizes is reserved for one group than for the other. We show that it can be difficult for an observer to detect the presence or absence of discrimination in the contest, as both regimes can be observationally equivalent. In particular, one group's belief that it is allocated a lower share of prizes than the other group can be consistent with observed data even if no such group quotas actually exist. Conversely, the belief that the contest does not discriminate can be consistent with data when, in fact, discrimination exists. Incorrect beliefs will therefore not be revised, as the contest generates no evidence to the contrary.","[Klumpp, Tilman; Su, Xuejuan] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Klumpp, T (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, 1602 Fishburne Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",tklumpp@emory.edu; xuejuan.su@emory.edu,,,,,,,35,4,5,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

An action profile is said to be achievable if it is the limit point of a subgame perfect equilibrium path. Necessary conditions are derived for achievability under relatively general conditions. They imply that any efficient profile that is approximately achievable must be in the core of the underlying coalitional game. In some, but not all, games with discounting, the necessary conditions for achievability are also sufficient for a profile to be the limit of achievable profiles as the period length shrinks to zero. Consequently, in these games when the period length is very short, (i) the set of achievable profiles does not depend on the move structure, (ii) an efficient profile can be approximately achieved if and only if it is in the core, and (iii) any achievable profile can be achieved almost instantly.","Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Matthews, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",stevenma@econ.upenn.edu,,,,,,,18,10,15,0,10,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The players compete in a real-effort task for the role of the proposer. The role of the responder is randomly allocated to one of the other two participants. The third participant, the non-responder, receives a fixed payment our treatment variable - and makes no decision. Knowing the size of this payment, the proposer makes a take-it-or-leave-offer to the responder. Most responders appear to ignore the non-responder when the payment the latter receives is low, but not when it is high. As a result, the existence of a non-responder and the payment they receive has a pronounced effect on bargaining outcomes and increases overall rejection rates. We present a simple model in which agents select the members of their reference group strategically to reduce the extent of cognitive dissonance they experience.

We analyse the effects of the structural change on the distribution of household income using a macro-micro approach. Our work shows that, nationwide, all income deciles experience higher real incomes in the order of 2%. Our results show that a previously state-owned monopoly industry can experience significant structural change while generating significant improvements in household real income without leading to significantly adverse impacts on national or regional income inequality. It suggests that policy makers in advanced economies should seriously consider such reforms given that they may generate large economic benefits with rather small economic costs.

In order to assess welfare and, in particular, inequality effects involved in each episode, we built a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous-agent capable of exploring the relationship between fiscal policy variables and the endogenous cross-section distribution of income, wealth and welfare. The results confirm that, for the Netherlands, a pure expenditure-based strategy is slightly superior relative a (partial) revenue-based one. In spite of positive welfare gains, the model predicts significant transition costs in both episodes due to depletion of insurance capacity, higher inequality and output losses.

Studies examining the linkage between defence spending and government debt have been relatively rare. Given the recent Global Financial Crisis, originating in the developed economies, and the changed international security picture since 9/11, it is timely to reconsider the defence-debt nexus in the rich economies. This study pays particular attention to developing an empirical strategy which is both soundly based on economic theory concerning the evolution of public debt and which uses econometric methods that are welladapted to the dynamic aspects of the relationship. From the standpoint of economic theory, if a government seeks to minimize the distortionary costs of taxation, then taxation will follow a random walk. Unexpected shocks (war and recession) will cause debt. Other idiosyncratic national-level political considerations that affect the evolution of debt can be factored out by the use of a dynamic panel estimation method. Employing the ArellanoBond dynamic panel model to the data available from members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and North Atlantic Treaty Organization over the periods 19882009 and 19992009, this study finds that the defence burden is a statistically significant and economically important determinant of public debt.","Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Arts & Business, Maroochydore, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast,"Alexander, WRJ (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Arts & Business, Maroochydore, Australia.",ralexand@usc.edu.au,"Alexander, William Robert/IQR-4212-2023","Alexander, William/0000-0003-1604-1870",,,,,28,14,14,1,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The paper exploits a unique dataset, including direct information on credit rationing for 1200 Italian firms over the last twenty years. We find that the elasticity of a firm's investment to the availability of bank credit has been significant in periods of economic contraction, but not in other periods (the ability to tap alternative sources of finance may arguably explain this result) and that during the global crisis the impact of credit quantity constraints on Italian investment in manufacturing was significant.

Although an EG can inform the public, the welfare effects are ambiguous. Therefore, the EG may not have an incentive to acquire information about the firm's production practices.

I produce several findings. First, food price fluctuations are significant predictors of multiple measures of terrorism, while energy and housing prices are not. Second, rapid food price increases, not decreases, promote terrorist attacks. Third, the relationship between food price volatility and terrorism is most consistently present in nondemocratic and hybrid political regimes and in medium human development countries rather than in democracies or in countries characterized by very high or very low economic development.","Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Piazza, JA (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jap45@psu.edu,,,,,,,65,16,20,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In skill intensive services factor augmenting technological change is slower for college graduates relative to less skilled workers. I find the opposite in the rest of the economy. This indicates that technological change is more complex than what we observe at the aggregate level. The results are consistent with changes in occupational mixes: low-skill workers in services reallocate into computer complementary occupations to a greater extent than college graduates in that sector. Occupational mixes in the rest of the private sector shift in the opposite direction. Thus, theoretical treatments of the underlying mechanisms of skill biased technological change may be improved by taking into account occupational mixes within broad education-sector groups.

J,"Chaudhry, A; Garner, P",,,,"Chaudhry, Azam; Garner, Phillip",,,The political economy of income comparisons and economic growth,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; Income comparisons; Political economy; Growth,INEQUALITY,"The literature on income inequality has provided various explanations as to how income inequality can affect growth, with the emphasis on ideas such as investments in human capital, issues of occupational choice, or the redistributive policies of governments. Inequality not only has a direct effect on the distribution of consumption in an economy, but it also has a powerful effect on people's subjective sense of well being. This paper takes a novel approach by focusing on the way in which a government's choice of economic policy can be influenced by how individuals perceive themselves relative to other individuals, both within the country and in foreign countries. The chosen policy affects economic growth, with the assumption being that policies that promote growth also tend to result in more switching of individuals between income groups. We show that the government's optimal policy depends on the importance of both inside country and outside country income comparisons, the fraction of national income earned by the different income groups, the potential magnitude of economic growth, the probability of switching between income groups in the presence of growth, and the relative importance of the various income groups. The model predicts that a greater degree of inside country income comparison is bad for growth whereas more outside country comparison is good for growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The second Intifada, from 2000, increased border restrictions severely and sharply reduced employment possibilities in Israel for Palestinians, increased unemployment and reduced income in the West Bank. Israeli employers responded by increasing the number of foreign workers, mostly from Asia. Growing unemployment among Israeli unskilled workers caused Israel to impose quotas on the employment of foreigners. This study evaluates the effects of reducing movement and access restrictions between Israel and the West Bank. The study uses a single country computable general equilibrium model, adapted to a Social Accounting Matrix of Israel for the year 2004, to simulate the effects of different Israeli labour policy regimes and to identify the inter sectoral, whole economy and distributional implications.

The paper argues that the domestic and global, financial and real origins of the crisis are deeply intertwined as the financialization of the U. S. economy and the globalization of production are inextricably linked. Thus, the merits of a Marxian interpretation of the crisis surpass those of the Minskyan for at least two reasons. First, the structural causes of the Great Recession lie not in the U. S. financial sector but in the system of globalized production which reflects the growing unevenness of capital accumulation on a planetary scale, manifested in the global imbalances. Second, the belief that social problems have monetary or financial origins, and could be resolved by tinkering with money and financial institutions, is fundamentally flawed, for the very recurrence of crises attests to the limits of fiscal and monetary policies as means to ensure balanced accumulation.","[Ivanova, Maria N.] Univ Kassel, D-34127 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Ivanova, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Fac Social Sci, Div Globalizat & Polit, 1 Nora Platiel Str, D-34127 Kassel, Germany.",m.ivanova@uni-kassel.de,,,,,,,59,31,58,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The target is premised on a view that country systems are strengthened when donors trust recipients to manage aid funds, but undermined when donors manage aid through their own separate parallel systems. This study provides an analytical framework for understanding donors' decisions to trust or bypass country systems. Empirical tests are conducted using data from three OECD-DAC surveys designed to monitor progress toward Paris Declaration goals. Tests show that use of recipient country systems is positively related to (1) the donor's reputational stake in the country's development, as proxied by the donor's share of aid provided to the recipient; (2) the trustworthiness or quality of those systems, as measured by cross-country corruption indicators; and (3) donors' risk tolerance, as proxied by public support for aid provision in donor countries.

The model has two testable implications: 1) when both cognitive biases are present, price dispersion and trade volume are pro-cyclical; 2) if anchoring decreases with time, then price dispersion and trade volume are higher for transactions with a previous purchase that is more recent. Using a data set that contains most real estate transactions in Hong Kong from 1992 to 2006, we find anchoring and loss aversion to be important, and the results are robust to type of housing and sample period. The finding is consistent with the strong correlations among house price, price dispersion, and volume found in the data. Moreover, anchoring, price dispersion and volume decrease with time since previous transaction. Our results suggest that anchoring and loss aversion contribute to the cyclicality of the housing market. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The model shows more clearly that, in the financial market affected by several non-probabilistic factors, risk-averse investors wish not only to reach the expected rate of returns in their actual investment, but also to assure that the maximum of their possible future risk is lower than an expected loss. Under the condition that the expected rate of returns is a normal distribution fuzzy variable, we proposed a theorem as the solution, and derive a crisp equivalent form of the possibilistic portfolio under constraints of VaR and risk-free investment. This model is an expansion of the fuzzy possibilistic mean-variance model by Zhang (2007). Finally, an empirical study is carried out using the data concerning some stocks of various industries listed at the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

The results show that an increase in foreign trade to GDP ratio results an increase in per capita carbon emissions and financial development variable has no significant effect on per capita carbon emissions in the long- run. These results also support the validity of EKC hypothesis in the Turkish economy. It means that the level of CO2 emissions initially increases with income, until it reaches its stabilization point, then it declines in Turkey.

While relating movements in the population density function to movements in the national savings rate, we are able to estimate the age response function with a high level of precision, and the estimated age response function is hump-shaped, which is generally consistent with the prediction from the LCI hypothesis. Running time-series regressions separately for individual countries, we also demonstrate that the estimated age response functions are consistent with the LCI hypothesis in a large proportion of countries, despite limited observations in a variety of countries. Finally, our time-series and cross-sectional analysis results imply that the LCI hypothesis is more likely to hold in a country wherein the growth rate of per capita GDP and the growth rate of population are high.","[Park, Cheolbeom] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Yu, Jina] Korea Informat Soc Dev Inst, Broadcasting & Spectrum Policy Res Div, Gwacheon Si 427710, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Korea University,"Park, C (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",cbpark_kjs@korea.ac.kr; angebus@kisdi.re.kr,"Park, Cheolbeom/AAD-4180-2019","Park, Cheolbeom/0000-0001-5753-217X",,,,,22,1,1,1,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Several recent models, which give rise to stunning results with higher-order uncertainties, turn out to operate with certain consistent order-2 priors. We introduce canonical representations of consistent finite-order priors, which we apply to establish a criterion for determining the orders of strategically relevant beliefs for abstract Harsanyi type spaces. We derive finite-order projections of type spaces and discuss convergence of BNEs based on them as the projection order increases. Finally, we introduce finite-order total variation distances between priors, which are suitable for analyzing the issues on equilibrium continuity and robustness.

The main application issue is how to define the reference point, i.e., the value that travellers use as a reference to distinguish gains and losses in the experienced travel times. Moreover, the question can be asked whether all travellers have the same reference point or whether heterogeneity in their behaviour plays an important role. This paper aims to (i) provide a behavioural interpretation of the reference point, (ii) investigate the role of heterogeneity in the reference point and (iii) discuss how to take heterogeneity into account. These aspects are discussed with the aid of an empirical route choice experiment and a model specification in which travel time is the main variable. Two model frameworks are proposed, one accounting for heterogeneity and another considering no heterogeneity in travellers' behaviour, and their outcomes are compared. Results show improvements in the ability of Prospect Theory to predict route choice behaviour by accounting for heterogeneity in the reference point. This is particularly the case when the reference point reflects travelers' route preferences. Statistical analyses show the significance of accounting for heterogeneity in travellers' behaviour. Thus, we cannot reject the hypothesis that heterogeneity leads to improvements in the prediction ability of Prospect Theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to test our suggestions, we implement a field experiment where participants are asked to fill a questionnaire on pro-environmental behaviours under different incentive schemes, either with no monetary incentive (control) or with low or high monetary incentive directed either to the respondents (design A) or to an environmental cause (design B), or with a choice offered between A and B (design C). We investigate (i) whether there is a significant crowding-out effect, (ii) which design performs better to promote participation.

If monetary policy cannot offset increased credit spreads because it is constrained by the zero lower bound or otherwise, the sovereign risk channel exacerbates indeterminacy problems: private-sector beliefs of a weakening economy may become self-fulfilling. In addition, sovereign risk may amplify the effects of cyclical shocks.

We show that trade leads to higher infrastructure investment so that domestic firms become more productive and can, thus, better compete internationally. However, infrastructure investment also has a detrimental effect on firms, as it is financed through firm taxation. As a result, when some firms have stronger political ties than others, trade leads to weaker institutions and more cronyism as the government attempts to lower the tax burden on the politically connected firms. Moreover, we show that trade with a partner characterized by high aggregate firm productivity or low firm fixed costs induces a country to invest more heavily in both its infrastructure and its institutional framework.

Our model predicts that the decision maker is too prone to choose options with concentrated advantages relative to alternatives, but maximizes utility when the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives are equally concentrated. Applying our model to intertemporal choice, these results predict that a person exhibits present bias and time inconsistency when-such as in lifestyle choices and other widely invoked applications of hyperbolic discounting-the future effect of a current decision is distributed over many dates, and the effects of multiple decisions accumulate. But unlike in previous models, in our theory (1) present bias is lower when the costs of current misbehavior are less dispersed, helping explain why people respond more to monetary incentives than to health concerns in harmful consumption; and (2) time inconsistency is lower when a person commits to fewer decisions with accumulating effects in her ex ante choice. In addition, a person does not fully maximize welfare even when making decisions ex ante: (3) she commits to too much of an activity-for example, exercise or work-that is beneficial overall; and (4) makes future-biased commitments when-such as in preparing for a big event-the benefit of many periods' effort is concentrated in a single goal.","[Koszegi, Botond] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Central European University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Koszegi, B (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",,,"Szeidl, Adam/0000-0001-9750-4843",,,,,67,196,234,1,81,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The reform, becoming effective on January 1 2004, requires the elderly to formally report their job search efforts to the employment office in order to avoid a (temporary) cut in benefits. Before the new law was passed, unemployed individuals were allowed to stop all search activity at the moment they turned 57.5. Estimating various duration models using difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity approaches, we find that for several groups of individuals who are affected by the policy change, the stricter search requirements significantly increases their entry rate into employment. However, we also find evidence of a higher outflow to sickness/disability insurance schemes, a presumably unwanted side-effect of the policy change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We apply the more efficient system GMM estimator in dynamic panel data that combines first difference and original level specification to deal with the problems of weak instruments. Our dataset covers 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period of 1981-2009. Additionally, the paper sought to examine both the direct and indirect impacts of financial liberalization policies on economic growth and financial deepening using a much more comprehensive and recent financial liberalization dataset. The econometric results suggest that, on average, financial liberalization is negatively associated with income growth in SSA region. Our findings provide support for the skeptical empirical view of financial liberalization in emerging markets, which show that liberalization, by itself, might be associated with lower economic growth through leading to destabilization, stimulating domestic capital flight and increasing the risk of financial fragility. However, the research finds that financial liberalization does indeed impact positively on financial deepening and resource mobilization in SSA region, after controlling for key macroeconomic factors such as institutional quality, fiscal imbalances and inflation. In fact the study reports a stronger reforms effect for countries that have stronger legal institutions, protection of property rights and higher human capital. Policy-wise, the study finds that institutional and human capital factors are important in explaining growth and financial development; therefore, it is necessary for SSA governments to promote a stronger and more transparent institutional development as we move forward.

They are used everywhere and play an important role also in delivery of better and efficient healthcare services. The health care is currently not only in Czech Republic one of the biggest challenges for advanced information and communication technology. Some of the main problems (ineffective use of some kinds of technological equipment, useless frequency of diagnostic tests, prescription of drugs often without knowledge of other drugs used by the same patient, several times visits of some patients to verify diagnosis) can be solved by sharing data and integrated information. The goal of this article is to find the main barriers of successful ICT deployment in hospitals in Czech Republic. The qualitative research of Information systems management and technologies was realized in three hospitals. This research was realized during one year (2012) by the structure questionnaire and interviews with IT managers, human resource officers, research and design (R&D) managers and other management staff. The results confirm increasing use of Information and communication technology In health care sector especially in infrastructure, security and in education of staff. This is related to increasing requirement of financial resources and it is the biggest problem in all Czech hospitals. These increasing financial needs are in the conflict with political opinion and with the effort to keep health care free of charge especially in election years. Article also brings results of the secondary research which was oriented towards use of process management systems in Czech hospitals. These software tools can help to solve the biggest problems with lack of financial funds and to manage the effective and efficient hospital processes and ICT services.","[Antlova, Klara] Tech Univ, Fac Econ, Deparment Informat, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,,klara.antlova@tul.cz,"Antlova, Klara/O-6401-2016",,,,,,18,1,1,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,9,17,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300001,0

It is also found that income in the two countries has significant impacts on the bilateral trade flows in both the short- and long-run.

He then proceeds to fill this basic cycle with all the essential activities that it should contain. The activities in the basic Counter Competitive Intelligence cycle are as follows: 1. Assignment 2.

First, we compute the equilibrium physical to creative capital ratios and the relationships between the neutral productivity shifters and the output prices. Second, we show that agricultural and services consumption are a constant multiple of manufacturing consumption. Third, we note that under certain conditions, an equilibrium in which all sectors of our urban economy grow at a constant rate does not exist. Fourth, we show that a constant growth path (CGP) equilibrium exists in which, across the three sectors, the pattern of consumption changes and there is a reallocation of creative capital.

This paper investigates the forces behind the post-NAFTA decrease in wage inequality. Using a quantile decomposition, I show that the decline in wage inequality is driven by a decline in the returns to education and potential experience, especially at the top of the wage distribution. Supply and demand are the main contributors to this change. On the supply side, there were substantial increases in college enrollment rates after 1994, which translated into an increase in the proportion of workers with a college degree. However, this increase in supply was not met by an increase in demand for the highly educated: the proportion of the workforce in top qualified occupations and close to the top occupations did not increase as much as the increase in supply. As a result, college educated workers exercised wage pressure in top and less-than-top qualified occupations. A Bound and Johnson (1992) decomposition confirms that changes in relative supply are the main determinant behind the decrease in wage inequality.","Colmex, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Campos-Vázquez, RM (通讯作者)，Colmex, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx,,"Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M./0000-0003-0251-5051",,,,,36,5,14,0,9,CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS,LOMAS DE SANTA FE,"CARRETERA MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, LOMAS DE SANTA FE 01210 D F, MEXICO",1665-2045,,,ECON MEX,Econ.

We present a simple model that studies the macroeconomic causes and consequences of dynastic management. In our model, the incidence of dynastic management depends, among other factors, on the imperfections of contractual enforcement.

The results are typically related to the stages of development with Brazil and Russia coming off a recession in the 1990s to grow in the 2000s, while India and China were on a comparatively stable growth path. Our results suggest, at least for the BRICs examined, that while efficiency wedges play a major role in jump-starting recovery, investment wedges are equally important for sustaining the recovery. Relating wedge patterns to institutional and financial reforms, we find that financial market developments and effective governance in BRICs in the last decade are consistent with improvements in investment and efficiency wedges that led to growth.","[Chakraborty, Suparna] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Otsu, Keisuke] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of San Francisco; University of Kent,"Chakraborty, S (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",schakraborty2@usfca.edu,,,,,,,36,11,11,0,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

This paper aims at providing further evidence on the role of sectoral reallocation between private and public sectors in explaining the impact of shocks to oil revenues on the economic growth rates of major oil producing countries (namely the GCC - Gulf Corporation Council - countries). The effects of oil shocks and expansionary fiscal policy on the business cycle of oil producing countries are examined. The possibility to distinguish between various components of public sector spending policy (that is, purchases of consumption goods, investments in productive activities and compensation for public employees) is, in particular, allowed for. A real business cycle (RBC) model is calibrated to fit the data on an average oil producing country. Results from the simulation of the theoretical model suggest that the possibility that the expansion of the size of the government (due, in particular, to the increase in the number of employees) can explain a large fraction of the negative effects of shocks to oil revenues on the private sector of the economy. However, since the growth in size of the public sector more than compensate for the reduction in size of the private sector, an increase in oil revenues has the effect to boost total output.

While the goal of this policy is to improve college access for disadvantaged and minority students, the use of a school-specific standard to determine eligibility could have unintended consequences. Students may increase their chances of being in the top 10% by choosing a high school with lower-achieving peers. Our analysis of students' school transitions between 8th and 10th grade three years before and after the policy change reveals that this incentive influences enrollment choices in the anticipated direction. Among the subset of students with both motive and opportunity for strategic high school choice, at least 5% enroll in a different high school to improve the chances of being in the top 10%. These students tend to choose the neighborhood high school in lieu of transferring to more competitive schools and, regardless of own race, typically displace minority students from the top 10% pool. Relatively few students have both the motive and opportunity to behave strategically in the short run, so systemic effects are inherently slight. Our finding of sizable take-up in the face of costly strategizing, however, suggests that endogenous group membership may be important in the longer run and in other settings where individuals can select their peers and are then graded on a curve.

Market segmentation is a part of strategic marketing, together with targeting and positioning, preceded by marketing research and followed by creating, implementing and controlling the marketing mix. As well as being an essential field of academic research, market segmentation proved to be a very useful concept for managers. The market segmentation concept dates back almost six decades, but issues raised regarding market segmentation more than three decades ago are still relevant and the number of different approaches in answering these questions is high. Preference-based segmentation can also be viewed in this context. Differences in consumers' preferences are, in fact, one of the vital causes of market segmentation. Preference-based market segmentation can be conducted by using conjoint analysis in combination with cluster analysis. The benefits of such approach are multiple, as they give rise to opportunities for: formulating the questions in a manner similar to real-life purchasing situations; reducing the number of socially desirable answers; introducing several attributes of a given product thus enabling an insight into the relative importance of the product's attributes, and order of preferences for different levels of these attributes, and, based on this, defining different market segments; testing the significance of various other market segmentation criteria (sociodemographic, psychographic and/or behavioural) for profiling the established segments; increasing the comparability of results of different studies; using this approach in planned new product launches and on emerging and developing markets as well as studying the difference between expressed preferences and purchases, in terms of obstacles preventing preferences to transform into purchase phase. Besides theoretical aspects regarding market segmentation and preference-based market segmentation by using conjoint and cluster analysis, this article demonstrates the use of such approach in researching student population in Vojvodina (the northern province of the Republic of Serbia) and this population's preferences to yoghurt (250 questionnaires handed out, 123 returned filled in, 98 included in the final analysis). In addition to results at the total sample level, two segments were identified and differences between them were investigated. Implications to the questions raised in the theoretical section of the article were sought on the obtained results. The article also seeks to point to the benefits of using this approach in domestic conditions, where its use is almost negligible.","[Djokic, Nenad] Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Salai, Suzana; Kovac-Znidersic, Ruzica; Djokic, Ines] Fac Econ Subotica, Subotica 24000, Serbia; [Tomic, Gordana] Higher Sch Profess Studies, Belgrade Business Sch, Beograd 11000, Serbia",,"Djokic, N (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, 4 Vladimira Perica Valtera St, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",nenad.djokic.vpsns@gmail.com; sazu@ef.uns.ac.rs; znikor@ef.uns.ac.rs; mines@ef.uns.ac.rs; gotom@neobee.net,"Djokic, Nenad/HIK-2985-2022","Djokic, Nenad/0000-0001-8229-8354",,,,,39,13,18,0,41,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Unlike most previous work, we estimate wage effects along the distribution of native wages. We derive a flexible empirical strategy that does not rely on pre-allocating immigrants to particular skill groups. In our empirical analysis, we demonstrate that immigrants downgrade considerably upon arrival. As for the effects on native wages, we find a pattern of effects whereby immigration depresses wages below the 20th percentile of the wage distribution but leads to slight wage increases in the upper part of the wage distribution. This pattern mirrors the evidence on the location of immigrants in the wage distribution. We suggest that possible explanations for the overall slightly positive effect on native wages, besides standard immigration surplus arguments, could involve deviations of immigrant remuneration from contribution to production either because of initial mismatch or immigrant downgrading.","[Dustmann, Christian; Frattini, Tommaso; Preston, Ian P.] CReAM Ctr Res & Anal Migrat, London, England; [Dustmann, Christian; Preston, Ian P.] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Frattini, Tommaso] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Frattini, Tommaso] LdA Ctr Studi Luca dAgliano, Milan, Italy; [Preston, Ian P.] IFS, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of Milan,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，CReAM Ctr Res & Anal Migrat, London, England.",,,"FRATTINI, TOMMASO/0000-0002-9844-881X",,,,,33,258,295,9,108,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The phenomena such as opening up, globalization and democratization of the society have brought increased interest in the company culture and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) within the field of organization strategies. In the field of human resources new approaches are applied, such as diversity management or integrated talent management. This paper presents a research study focusing on implementation of diversity management in the Czech corporate setting from the perspective of the large companies which, using their international background, successfully implement various diversity management policies and programs. The case studies presented In this paper continue our previous international research aimed to highlight just diversity management in the Visegrad countries [6]. The findings of the present study clearly Indicate the connection between the organizational strategy and the CSR strategy and the organizational culture when applying various activities in the field of diversity management. The results of the research study also indicate that knowledge-based organizations are engaged in development and care of people who are represent human potential Inevitable for the Innovation potential of companies. The six companies covered in the case studies ranks among successful companies in the Czech Republic that have already gained a number of awards for activities in the above field.

This implies that there is an extra cost to becoming a leader and, hence, to choosing high productive effort in the early stages of a tournament. The incentives to exert productive effort are thereby reduced. We show that this problem can be solved by concealing intermediate information on the performances of workers (i.e., by clever information management).

The DEA method is convenient because it is based on the ratio between input- and output-indicators thus measuring the efficiency with which the EU countries transform their inputs into outputs. DEA conveniently analyses effective/ineffective positions of each country providing numerical values describing the efficiency of economic processes in these countries. Efficiency can be thus considered as a source of competitiveness. When applying the DEA method, the indicators of the Country Competitiveness Index (CCI) are used.

Preferences over social risk can be closely approximated by individual risk attitudes when subjects have no information about the risk preferences of other group members. We find no evidence that subjects systematically reveal different risk attitudes in a social setting with no prior knowledge about the risk preferences of others compared to when they solely bear the consequences of the decision.

Second, the use of the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator permits us not to pre-filter the data as often done in the current literature, and can take into account the possibility of cointegration between unemployment and output. Third, in addition to the short-run relationship or cyclical components between unemployment and output, we also estimate the long-run linkage between these two important variables. Empirical results show that unemployment and output are long-run cointegrated, irrespective of using country- or state-level data. Moreover, the unemployment-output linkages are found to be negative and highly significant both in the short- and long-run. Our results not only confirm the validity of Okun's law (in the short-run) but also point out that a similar tradeoff exists in the long run.","[Huang, Ho-Chuan (River)] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Tamsui 25137, Taipei County, Taiwan; [Yeh, Chih-Chuan] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan",Tamkang University,"Huang, HC (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Ying Chun Rd, Tamsui 25137, Taipei County, Taiwan.",river@mail.tku.edu.tw,,"Huang, Ho-Chuan/0000-0002-9763-0572",,,,,34,37,39,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Also, the network relationships between the emerging markets and their attributes across different clusters are further researched. It is found that countries at a higher level of market potential also show a higher level of economic freedom, commercial infrastructure, market intensity and market consumption capacity. With the development of their economies, the emerging markets have experienced different transitions. This research further estimates the switching probabilities across different clusters by a Markov chain model. Future ratios of different country clusters in the emerging markets are also forecasted.

The relationships between monetary and fiscal policy their coordination, cooperation or mutual antagonism are basic determinants of successful implementation for economic policy of the state. Fiscal and monetary policies usually have their main aims different and in practical economic and political decision some conflict situations may arise. Each of these types of policy has to make its decision with regard to the other one. Methodical approaches of this contribution are based on the game theory, which deals with the analysis of a wide range of decision situations with more participants (players) and it is primarily focused on the conflict situations. This game-theoretical approach is responsible for creating the theoretical model, which is then dealt with the empirical analysis. We find a distinctly stabilizing role of monetary policy and relatively problematic stabilizing role of fiscal policy in the analyzed countries. The dominant role of monetary policy is statistically confirmed in the case of the Czech Republic and Hungary.","[Janku, Jan; Kappel, Stanislav] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Janku, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",jan.janku@vsb.cz; stanislav.kappel@vsb.cz,"Janků, Jan/AAA-7569-2021",,"Student grant competition Ekf, VSB-TU Ostrava [SP2013/179]","Student grant competition Ekf, VSB-TU Ostrava","This article was created with a support of Student grant competition Ekf, VSB-TU Ostrava as project SP2013/179 - The Interaction of Monetary and Fiscal policy in the Context of the Game Theory in the countries of the Visegrad Group.",,17,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-248-3095-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,75,86,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393737200008,0

Yet only comparison can help to determine the reasons why the commitment of employees differs by sectors. The purpose of this paper is to establish the impact of motivation on employees' commitment to the organization in the public and private sectors. Analysis of scientific literature was used in order to distinguish the theoretical aspects of employee motivation and organizational commitment. Questionnaire of private and public sector employees was conducted and the statistical analysis of questionnaire data led to the evaluation of the impact of employees' motivation on commitment to the organization in the public and private sectors. The results of this paper are consistent with the analysis of previous studies, which showed that an Increased organizational commitment is noticeable in the private sector. In the public sector the means of motivation often include gratitude, recognition, good relations with colleagues, and in the private companies - the premium for the achievement of organization's goal, leisure events, and gratitude. The means of motivation have different effects on employees' commitment to the organization. In the public sector compared to the private, relies on Immaterial motivation means, i.e. rarer pay raises, encouragement premiums, which are inconsistent with the needs of employees. Whether the target of the means of motivation is an individual or a team, it has no effect on organizational commitment.","[Jasinskas, Edmundas; Zalgiryte, Lina; Giziene, Vilda; Simanaviciene, Zaneta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Business Econ, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,,edmundas.jasinskas@ktu.lt; lina.zalgiryte@ktu.lt; vilda.giziene@ktu.lt; zaneta.simanaviciene@ktu.lt,"Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019; Giziene, Vilda/HGC-9674-2022; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019","Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405;",,,,,24,0,0,2,29,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7372-953-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,268,277,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BA2WJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000333936300028,0

In late 2000s with the financial crisis, critiques have argued that these economies had fallen into liquidity trap sooner because of the policy mistake of adhering to the 2% inflation target when the policy rate was already too close to zero. As the argument goes, since there was not enough room left to maneuver, central bankers were powerless in their attempt to revive the economy when aggregate demand collapsed. Using SVAR methodology, this paper formally investigates whether unanticipated deviation of OECD short-term rates from the fund rate can indeed explain differential unemployment rate with the US. It also discusses whether low-inflation targeting monetary policy is to be blamed for the financial crisis. The results show that interest rate differential shocks have no effects on unemployment in the very short-run. However, in the long-run, the cost for deviating drastically from US monetary policy is indeed higher and persistent unemployment at home, on average 30, 102, and 186 basis-points after 10, 15, and 20 quarters, respectively for the period 1989q1-2009q4. This cost is on average higher for inflation- than non-inflation targeting countries. These findings suggest that the fear of unemployment was partly the reason central bankers kept interest rate low since commodity prices were falling as a result of globalization while the economies were returning to normal partly due to positive supply shocks. Since Canada had its interest rate well aligned with the fund rate prior to the crisis while the inflation target was 2%, but did not suffer as much because sound mortgage rules and financial regulation were in place, the view that higher inflation target might have produced a different outcome does not seem to rest on firm grounds. Therefore, this paper lends support to the view that lax mortgage rules and financial deregulations in the US were the main factors responsible for the crisis. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Under cost uncertainty over the harmful activity, we show that an efficient configuration of restrictions must balance the potential reduction in appropriation costs with the possibility of allocatively inefficient bargaining restrictions.

The pure spread concept and the two-step estimation approach of Ho and Saunders (1981) have been used to break down the interest spreads in Estonia. The pure spread is determined mainly by risk aversion and the market structure of the banking sector, with money market interest volatility playing quite a modest role in the long-term equilibrium. The regulatory, efficiency, and bank portfolio effects bear roughly equal responsibility for the observed spread, whereas credit risk adds only a tiny portion to the interest markup. Strong liquidity and foreign capital permit lower spreads.","[Maennasoo, Kadri] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Männasoo, K (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",,,"Mannasoo, Kadri/0000-0002-3011-168X",,,,,22,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

In this sense the purpose of this research is to understand how the modes of knowledge conversion (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) affect reverse logistics and examine the joint influence of these variables on the flexibility of distribution of information (because information has a key role for these variables) and performance of the organization. Our results provide empirical evidence confirming 1) the more necessary is the knowledge creation processes in the organization the greater are the importance and the ability to anticipation of reverse logistics systems for the organization, 2) also we found the importance of reverse logistics enhances the effects of flexibility of distribution of information and reinforces the belief that it is a fundamental capacity that increases the value of the company's products obtained by reverse logistics processes, 3) the findings have provided empirical evidence of the existence of positive relationship between reverse logistics, flexibility and business performance. In short, the results have shown the importance for the organization of knowledge management systems and reverse logistics systems that give your company a greater ability to anticipate and flexibly to the increasing changes taking place in a competitive environment of high uncertainty.

We find that income rank matters independently of absolute income, with greater weight given to rank by males, migrants, and individuals from wealthy families. Rank-sensitive individuals require as much as a 200% increase in income to be compensated for going from the top to the bottom of the income distribution. Migrants residing abroad for longer periods of time, and with more affluent job titles, are more likely to compare themselves to others at the destination. A dynamic choice model of compensating incomes predicts the average respondent to need a permanent increase in income of up to $10,000 (70%) when moving from a society with a mean income of $14,000 (e.g., Mexico) to a society with a mean income of $46,000 (e.g., the USA).","[Mujcic, Redzo; Frijters, Paul] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Mujcic, R (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Level 6,Colin Clark Bldg, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.mujcic@uq.edu.au; p.frijters@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,60,25,30,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The coupling of the French, Belgian and Dutch electricity markets (the trilateral market) in November 2006 was a real success. The extension of the system to Germany in November 2010 also proceeded smoothly and the intent is to continue with the same market architecture. But Market Coupling is based on a zonal system which has often failed in meshed grids. This may cast doubts on what will happen in the future when electricity demand picks up again and wind develops. The nodal system has generally been more successful than zonal architectures but its implementation is not currently foreseen in the EU. This paper analyzes versions of Market Coupling that differ by the organization of counter-trading. While underplayed in current discussions, counter-trading could become a key element of Market Coupling as its geographic coverage expands and wind penetrates. We simplify matters by assuming away strategic behavior between the energy and counter-trading markets and conduct the analysis on a stylized six node example taken from the literature. We simulate Market Coupling for different assumptions of zonal decomposition and coordination of Transmission System Operators (TSOs). We show that these assumptions matter: even in the absence of strategic behavior, Market Coupling can be quite vulnerable to the particular situation on hand; counter-trading can work well or completely fail and it is not clear beforehand what will prevail. Our analysis relies on standard economic notions such as social welfare and Generalized Nash equilibrium, but the use of these notions is probably novel. The nodal organization is the reference first best scenario: different zonal decompositions and degrees of coordination are then studied with respect to this first best solution.

By applying these methods, the Ratio system and the Reference point approach of the MOORA method can be used in fuzzy environment. Thanks to the proposed modification, the MOORA method can be used to solve a greater number of real world problems.

In order to address this gap, we use directional tests to investigate whether forecasts of Gross Domestic Product by corporate executives are valuable to their users. Our findings indicate that all the forecasts with forecast horizons from 1 to 14 months are valuable, whereas established literature indicates that longer-term forecasts tend not to be valuable. This suggests that corporate executives are concerned with and focus on longer-term economic environments and can therefore serve as an important resource for policymakers. However, some of the useful forecasts with real-time data, in particular those in the Tankan survey, are not useful with historical data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the validity of the relationship lending hypothesis depends on the relative bargaining power between the buyer and sellers. Specifically, we find evidence that longer buyer-seller relationships may matter depending on the buyer-seller relative bargaining power. When a buyer depends too much on its main supplier, the supplier does not provide more credit as its relationship with the buyer matures. However, a longer buyer/main-supplier relationship is beneficial because a non-dependent buyer can obtain more overall credit from sellers. Depending on the extent to which this increase is due to an increase in the credit from the main suppliers, our findings are consistent with the relationship lending hypothesis. However, even if the increase mainly comes from other sellers, our findings imply that sellers extract a positive signal from a longer buyer/main-supplier relationship. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a second-stage regression, this article also analyses the determinants of productivity changes in terms of regulation, competition and ownership structure. The results show that mobile companies operating in countries that have recently joined the EU have a positive association with productivity change, in contrast to their counterparts in South-East Europe. Concerning market competition, the leading mobile operators that experience higher productivity changes operate in more concentrated markets. The results also indicate that international mobile operators perform better in terms of productivity change than their national equivalents. Finally, some of the implications of the findings for mobile operators' management and policymakers are provided.","[Usero, Belen; Asimakopoulos, Grigorios] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Business Management Div, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Usero, B (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Business Management Div, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",busero@emp.uc3m.es,"; Usero, Belen/R-5168-2017","ASIMAKOPOULOS, GRIGORIOS/0000-0003-3790-8277; Usero, Belen/0000-0002-3452-3905",,,,,50,5,6,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We reproduce the merit order of a thermal-dominated electricity system by establishing a non-linear dependency of wholesale electricity prices on the prices of fuels (coal and natural gas) and of CO2 emission allowances. The coefficients are estimated using a Markov Switching Regression. This approach might prove valuable for cross-hedging positions in the fuel, electricity and emission spot markets. It is also of use for studying the degree to which electricity prices in different countries reflect fuel and emission cost. Applying the model to the electricity markets of the UK and Germany, we find that British electricity prices are quite well-explained by short-run cost factors while the German ones are less well-explained.

In 1979, Daniel Yergin and the Harvard Business School Energy Project estimated that the United States could consume 30 or 40 percent less energy without reducing welfare. The central economic question around energy efficiency is whether there are investment inefficiencies that a policy could correct. First, we examine choices made by consumers and firms, testing whether they fail to make investments in energy efficiency that would increase utility or profits. Second, we focus on specific types of investment inefficiencies, testing for evidence consistent with each. Three key conclusions arise: First, the evidence presented in the long literature on the subject frequently does not meet modern standards for credibility. Second, when one tallies up the available empirical evidence from different contexts, it is difficult to substantiate claims of a pervasive Energy Efficiency Gap. Third, it is crucial that policies be targeted. Welfare gains will be larger from a policy that preferentially affects the decisions of those consumers subject to investment inefficiencies.","[Allcott, Hunt] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Greenstone, Michael] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Allcott, Hunt; Greenstone, Michael] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",New York University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Allcott, H (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",hunt.allcott@nyu.edu; mgreenst@mit.edu,,,,,,,80,491,571,4,130,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Lending margins are optimally set by banks and have a significant effect on aggregate variables. Over the long run, stronger banking competition increases output by triggering a reallocation of available collateral towards investors. In the short-run, output, credit and housing prices are more responsive on impact to shocks in an environment of highly competitive banks. Also, stronger banking competition implies higher (lower) persistency of credit and output after a monetary (credit crunch) shock.","[Arce, Oscar] CNMV, Res & Stat Dept, Calle Miguel Angel 11, Madrid 28010, Spain; Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Arce, O (通讯作者)，CNMV, Res & Stat Dept, Calle Miguel Angel 11, Madrid 28010, Spain.",oarce@cnmv.es,"Andres, Javier/K-7793-2014","Andres, Javier/0000-0003-0980-4833",,,,,54,27,30,1,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

By exploiting a rich firm-level dataset, we calculate distance-based measures of spatial agglomeration, in which we distinguish between own-industry, other-industry and related-industry neighbouring firms. Our OLS estimates show that TFP is positively affected by proximity to own-industry and related-industry firms, whereas it decreases with proximity to other-industry firms. We also observe that localization economies are strong at low distances, and rapidly decay over space. Differently, related variety effects materialize after one kilometre, but are more persistent over distance. Our quantile regressions show that these results depend also on the position of the firm over the TFP distribution. In particular, when looking at KIBS with the lowest performance, we find that only localization economies are at work, and on a very limited geographical scale. Differently, top-performance KIBS benefit from proximity to technologically-related firms, and across a wider spatial scale.","[Antonietti, Roberto; Cainelli, Giulio] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno DSE, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Antonietti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali Marco Fanno DSE, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",roberto.antonietti@unipd.it; giulio.cainelli@unipd.it,,"Antonietti, Roberto/0000-0002-2172-4062",,,,,57,5,5,0,26,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We also find that individuals are practically risk neutral at small stakes and risk averse at large stakesa necessary condition, according to Rabins calibration theorem, for expected utility to provide a unified account of individuals attitudes toward risk.

We model the strategic interaction between firms that choose quality levels and anger-prone customers who pick their supplier based on their expectations of suppliers' quality. Strategic interaction can allow for multiple equilibria including some in which no firm invests in high quality.

Explicitly taking information acquired before job losses into account, married couples' dynamic labor supply equations are estimated by using a short pseudo-panel data set of Manpower Utilization Survey (MUS) in Taiwan during the period of 1993-2006. Our results indicate that the AWE in skilled families exhibits almost twice as big as those in unskilled families. When husbands' job loss is compounded with district- or industry-specific unemployment information, wives have slightly higher probabilities of labor force entry than those in the traditional model, and the probabilities increase with the length of observation. A comparison of the asymmetric response of the unskilled and the skilled wives suggests that facing husbands' job loss, unskilled wives respond to both economic downturns and upturns, but skilled wives only respond to economic downturns.

Official reserves are included in the interest rate rule to account for the constraint that these impose on monetary policy when the exchange rate is fixed. Also, the foreign interest rate is included in order to reflect the necessity of following the foreign monetary policy. The model is applied to Macedonian data from the period 1997 to 2011. In general, results indicate that monetary policy has been focused on domestic objectives during this period, despite the fixed currency. In addition, there seem to have been significant differences in the conduct of the monetary policy in the first and second half of this period. The response to inflation has been more aggressive in the earlier period, at a time when reserves appear less important, while the output gap is found to be important only in the latter period, possibly due to the stronger monetary policy transmission. Finally, results indicate that the monetary policy has likely moved from adaptive in the first period to rational in the second period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The question as to whether or not the emergence of new occupational cohorts correlates with differences in income is also explored. This analysis leads to the conclusion that a new middle class has taken shape that is composed of people who became full-fledged members of the labour force during the economic growth surge of the 1990s and 2000s.

Several levels of customer loyalty can be defined based on the strength of the brand-consumer relationship, out of which we study the closest relationship, the adherence. According to our central hypothesis, the brands to which the consumer adheres have a symbolic significance for the consumer. By linking loyalty and symbolic consumption the contradictions regarding their analysis can be reduced. According to our assumption, the basis of connection is that the image of those brands which the consumer loyal to match his/her self. This self-image congruence creates a symbolic relationship between the brand and its consumer. On the basis if this the central question of our research is: Can brand loyalty be explained by the self-image congruence? We study this issue on the group of the young or Generation Y. We analysed the topic both from qualitative and from quantitative aspects. In the course of the qualitative research, we aimed to reveal the consumption habits of the young with 192 in-depth interviews, with special regard to the symbolic role of brands as well as the relationship of loyalty and self-image congruence. According to the main findings of our qualitative research, brands and their symbolic content is particularly important for the young, which serve for them as self-expression besides fitting into a group. They are aware of the brand images and they can easily link self and brand image. We intended to support and extend these findings with our quantitative research. Based on 979 questionnaires, we reinforced our hypotheses regarding loyalty and self-image congruence on a nationally representative sample in terms of age and sex. The results indicate that a relationship can be assumed between loyalty and self-image congruence, that is, our assumption about linking loyalty and symbolic consumption seems to be well-founded.","[Pronay, Szabolcs; Hetesi, Erzsebet] Univ Szeged, Dept Business Adm, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Pronay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Dept Business Adm, Kalvaria Av 1, H-6722 Szeged, Hungary.",pronay.szabolcs@eco.u-szeged.hu; hetesi.erzsebet@eco.u-szeged.hu,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In contrast, we know little about how often manipulation occurs, its effects and how it responds to regulation. Suggested approaches for future research on these issues include: (1) collecting more comprehensive data sets of manipulation cases; (2) using detection controlled estimation methods to overcome sample selection and partial observability problems and (3) conducting controlled experiments.

It shows that in a world where outside options matter and investments are multidimensional, high asset specificity can foster nonintegration: a low level of specificity provides the most misdirected incentives when transacting in a market (because the outside option of external trade becomes so tempting), thus making a stronger case for nonintegration.","Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Ruzzier, CA (通讯作者)，Univ San Andres, Dept Econ, Vito Dumas 284,B1644BID, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",cruzzier@udesa.edu.ar,,,,,,,61,2,2,0,23,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

In this paper, we analyze notches in fuel economy policies, which aim to reduce negative externalities associated with fuel consumption. We provide evidence that automakers respond to notches in the Gas Guzzler Tax and mandatory fuel economy labels by precisely manipulating fuel economy ratings so as to just qualify for more favorable treatment. We then describe the welfare consequences of this behavior and derive a welfare summary statistic applicable to many contexts.

Thus, the outcome of the cartel-fringe open-loop equilibrium can be supported as an outcome of a subgame-perfect equilibrium. However the interpretation of the cartel-fringe model, where from the outset the fringe is assumed to be price taker, as a limit case of an asymmetric oligopoly with the agents playing Nash-Cournot, does not extend to the case where firms can use closed-loop strategies.

J,"Faigle, U; Grabisch, M",,,,"Faigle, Ulrich; Grabisch, Michel",,,Values for Markovian coalition processes,ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coalitional game; Coalition formation process; Exchange economy; Markov chain; Shapley value,GAMES,"Time series of coalitions (so-called scenarios) are studied that describe processes of coalition formation where several players may enter or leave the current coalition at any point in (discrete) time and convergence to the grand coalition is not necessarily prescribed. Transitions from one coalition to the next are assumed to be random and to yield a Markov chain. Three examples of such processes (the Shapley-Weber process, the Metropolis process, and an example of a voting situation) and their properties are presented. A main contribution includes notions of value for such series, i.e., schemes for the evaluation of the expected contribution of a player to the coalition process relative to a given cooperative game. Particular processes permit to recover the classical Shapley value. This methodology's power is illustrated with well-known examples from exchange economies due to Shafer (Econometrica 48:467-476, 1980) and Scafuri and Yannelis (Econometrica 52:1365-1368, 1984), where the classical Shapley value leads to counterintuitive allocations. The Markovian process value avoids these drawbacks and provides plausible results.","[Grabisch, Michel] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75013 Paris, France; [Faigle, Ulrich] Univ Cologne, Math Inst, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; University of Cologne,"Grabisch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",faigle@zpr.uni-koeln.de; michel.grabisch@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The CSME is a unique case of study given that it contains within it a monetary union: the OECS2. First, our results show that there is complete pass through in the retail lending rate for Trinidad and Tobago and for St. Lucia and therefore, by extension, in all the countries of the OECS3 but not the other countries of the CSME. In contrast, Wang and Lee (2009) found complete pass through for the US deposit rate but not in the rates of the other nine Asian countries. Second, in Wang and Lee (2009) the results of the TAR and MTAR models show asymmetric cointegrating relationships in the lending rate of three Asian countries and the deposit rate of five Asian countries. Comparatively, our results show asymmetric cointegrating relationship in the lending and deposit rate of only three countries out of six: Jamaica, Guyana and St. Lucia. Third, the results from the conditional mean equation in the EC-EGARCH(1, 1)-M model in Wang and Lee (2009) show that for the countries with asymmetric cointegrating relationships, the lending rate displays downward adjustment rigidity and the deposit rate displays upward adjustment rigidity. In contrast, our results show that both rates for Jamaica display upward adjustment rigidity and both rates for Guyana and St. Lucia display downward adjustment rigidity. Finally, similarly to Wang and Lee (2009), our results from the EC-EGARCH(1, 1)-M models show that the effect of interest rate volatility on interest rates varies among countries. Three out of the Asian countries from Wang and Lee (2009) support the collusive pricing arrangement hypothesis while in our case it happens only in two countries out of six from the CSME: Guyana and St. Lucia. Moreover, the leverage effect exists in the lending rate for two out six countries in the CSME as it happens in Wang and Lee (2009) in two out of their Asian countries. Along the same lines, the leverage effect exists in the deposit rate of three countries in the CSME, contrary to Wang and Lee (2009), who do not find any evidence stall. This shows evidence of an important heterogeneity in the behaviour of the CSME countries and that Trinidad and Tobago and St. Lucia (showing the effect of belonging to a monetary union) are our only analysed countries where, as in the US, there is complete pass through and the central bank can transfer all the cost associated with an increase in its policy rate to the retail rates.

The concept of marketing communication effectiveness assumes that there are variables that can have a positive influence on the effectiveness of marketing communications, and confirm the central concept of marketing communication effectiveness as having a positive impact on organizational performance.

As part of the effort to promote regional investment, particularly intra-ASEAN investment, several schemes have been implemented such as the 1998 Framework Agreement on the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA). This study investigated the impact of the AIA and other foreign direct investment (FDI) initiatives on intra-ASEAN FDI. The findings on the impact of the AIA, measured via several proxies, do not provide strong evidence of benefits from the AIA, or from other investment-promoting initiatives. With equal treatment given to non-ASEAN investors, ASEAN members may have to provide separate incentives to enhance local entrepreneurs' competitiveness, which should in the long run be translated into higher FDI from ASEANeither to other ASEAN members or to non-ASEAN countries. Overall, the results do not argue wholly against the idea of the AIA, given that some of the AIA proxies have a significant impact.

The paper shows that the volatility of mutual fund investments is quantitatively driven by both the underlying investors and fund managers through (i) injections into/redemptions out of each fund and (ii) managerial changes in country weights and cash. Both investors and managers respond to country returns and crises and adjust their investments substantially, e.g., generating large reallocations during the global financial crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries during bad times and increasing it when conditions improve. Managers actively change country weights over time, although there is significant short-run pass-through from returns to country weights. Capital flows from mutual funds do not seem to have a stabilizing role and expose countries in their portfolios to foreign shocks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper analyzes the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on income inequality and asks whether the relationship depends on absorptive capacity or not, by using a cross-sectional dataset taken from 54 countries over the period 1980-2005. We adopt the endogenous threshold regression model proposed by Hansen (2000) and Caner and Hansen (2004) and find strong evidence of a two-regime split in our sample. That is, FDI is likely to be harmful to the income distribution of those host countries with low levels of absorptive capacity. By contrast, our results support the perspective that FDI has little effect on income inequality in the case of countries with better absorptive capacity. It is also shown that international trade can lead to more equal income distribution. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most previous studies, however, have only considered the impact of tax level on FDI volume. This paper enhances this view by assuming that multinational enterprises (MNEs) can use transfer prices systems and have investment timing flexibility. Thus, it evaluates the impact of the use of international transfer pricing systems on state policy and on the investment timings of MNEs. In uncertain business environments (with the periodic releases of news), investment can increase if MNEs delay investment decisions. This paper shows how tax differentials can attract FDI and can influence MNE behavior. The equilibrium is set in a global environment where MNEs can shift their profits between states depending on local corporate tax rates. Assuming the use of transfer pricing schemes, this paper confirms the relationship between MNE behavior and the release of business news. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In general, collusive stability is non-monotonically related to economic integration. In the case of multilateral liberalization, the effect depends on the initial level of trade costs and the extent of liberalization. However, on the average, the complete elimination of trade costs is pro-competitive when these costs are sufficiently high initially. In the case of regional integration, the effect of liberalization is pro-competitive when external trade barriers are sufficiently high, but anti-competitive when these barriers are sufficiently low.

For the analysis we combine industry-level offshoring measures with micro-level data from a large German household panel survey and estimate ordinal fixed effects models. Our results indicate that offshoring to low-wage countries significantly raises job loss fears whilst offshoring to high-wage countries somewhat lowers them. Over our sample period from 1995 to 2006, offshoring to low and high-wage countries together can account for about 13% of the total increase in job loss fears. High-skilled workers are more sensitive to offshoring although their objective job loss risk is lower relative to low-skilled workers, which we argue reflects the fact that they have more to lose from unemployment.

In this area of China, tight linkages between the development of industrial clusters and specialized markets are based on social and economic foundations that have propelled the growth of market relations since the late 1970s. Together with local traditions and skills in both handcraft production and commerce, specialized markets accompanied the take-off of industrial clusters following the so-called Zhejiang model of development. The role of specialized markets is still crucial nowadays as a powerful channel for the distribution of consumer goods as well as a means of co-ordination of fragmented productions in China and abroad.

In a static framework, commitment to debt stabilization is superior to discretion only when the public debtGDP ratio is high. Discretion, though, is always inferior to an optimal fiscal rule, which however entails a positive predetermined debt growth. As usual, the introduction of uncertainty determines an additional advantage for discretion. Finally, if dynamic considerations are introduced, the optimal fiscal rule is characterized by positive debt growth in the short run and debt stabilization in the long run.","[Bianchi, Carluccio] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Menegatti, Mario] Univ Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Pavia; University of Parma,"Bianchi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",,"Menegatti, Mario/C-4197-2014","Menegatti, Mario/0000-0002-5893-9753",,,,,24,2,2,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This is a unique environment because, unlike other game shows used to examine risk-aversion, players participate individually or in teams varying in number from two to five. This creates a natural laboratory to measure performance and risk aversion conditional upon the size of the team as well as the characteristics of the team members. Teams are much more likely to complete overall tasks successfully. Most importantly, risk aversion estimates indicate that when participants are part of a group, they focus on the overall size of the dollar amounts that are at risk, rather than their slice of the pie.

In some areas, the majority of children are attending the low-cost private unaided schools. Children seem to do better in low-cost private schools compared to government ones, and at a fraction of the teacher cost. Figures show that many children currently purported to be out of school are in fact attending private schools that are unregistered/unrecognised, which are often missing from official data and statistics. But many writers, including some at UNESCO and Oxfam, are in denial over the reality and potentiality of private schooling or, despite the evidence, still assume that in order to provide greater access for the poor the government sector needs to be fixed. According to such voices, international aid money through bilateral and multilateral aid needs to focus on government schools. This essay critically examines the arguments of some of those who discount or deny the success and potentiality of private schooling. Some initiatives are also considered that focus on aiding low-cost private schools rather than government ones.","Newcastle Univ, EG W Ctr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, EG W Ctr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",pauline.dixon@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,14,22,0,16,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

The insider knows both value components and outsiders only know the shared component. The market maker receives a private signal in the form of a noisy transformation of the shared component, which we refer to as leakages. Before trade begins, the insider can disclose the value of the shared component to the entire market, thus removing the outsiders from the game. When the market maker's signal is sufficiently precise, the insider's benefit from knowing the shared component does not exceed the cost of concurrently trading with the outsiders, thus motivating the insider to reveal the shared component to the entire market. This result provides an explanation as to why some firm managers may naturally prefer to publicly disclose information rather than leaving it in the hands of select investors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Whether Chinese efforts to internationalize the RMB culminate in the currency achieving reserve status will be for China to realize. The path to reserve currency status, however, is not one that the Chinese can pursue unilaterally. Internationalization entails an interaction between private and public decision-making, and is a function of private-sector confidence as much as public policy. The outcome will be the result of strategic interplay involving public policies across systemically important countries and confidence-building among global savers and investors. The paper argues that international cooperation, especially among reserve currency countries on policy frameworks to achieve the common objectives of economic growth, full employment, price stability, and sustainable fiscal positions will define a coherent and well-functioning IMS.","[Jenkins, Paul; Zelenbaba, John] Ctr Int Governance & Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada",,"Jenkins, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Governance & Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",pjenkins@cigion-line.org; john.zelenbaba@mail.mcgill.ca,,,,,,,40,7,7,3,76,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Besides targeting the insulation standard, innovative (i.e. renewable energies-based and/or energy-efficient) residential heating systems (RHS) offer the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from space heating. Therefore, understanding the determinants of the RHS adoption decision becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we analyze the influence of preferences about RHS-specific attributes on the homeowners' adoption decision. Moreover, we control for the influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. To this end, we specify the discrete appliance choice by a multinomial logit model and apply it to representative survey data for Germany. Our findings show that there are different drivers for the adoption of innovative RHS (partly) based on renewable energies in newly built and existing 1- and 2-family homes, and that the importance of key drivers also differs across groups of homeowners and RHS, respectively. First, we find that adopters of a gas-and oil-fired condensing boiler with solar thermal support have a strong preference for energy savings, while adopters of a heat pump or wood pellet-fired boiler prefer being more independent from fossil fuels. Second, we find that owners of existing homes have less scope for preferences in the RHS adoption decision. The decision to replace a RHS in an existing home is rather driven by socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. Third. our findings are quite contrary for newly built homes. Here, preferences about RHS specific attributes are found to be highly relevant, while there is less evidence for an influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics on the adoption decision.

This paper documents these for four years of study (Years 3, 5, 7 and 9), and for the five NAPLAN domains (Grammar and Punctuation, Numeracy, Reading, Spelling and Writing). It then examines the extent to which the differences are due to characteristics of the schools, such as the socioeconomic status of the school and the gender mix of the total enrolment at the school. It is shown that a greater share of the difference in marks between Government and non-Government schools in Year 9 than in Year 3 is due to the characteristics of the schools. This implies that, consistent with recent press coverage, the better outcomes of the non-Government schools are due, in part at least, to a selection process that favours academically advantaged students.","[Miller, Paul W.] Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Miller, PW (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",paul.miller@curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,27,19,19,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This study uses the set of U.S. patents granted from 1976 to 2006 to assess the role of knowledge acquired from outside each energy patent's technological classification. It identifies the effect of external knowledge on the forward citation frequency of energy patents. The results support the claim above. Regression coefficients on citations to external prior art are positive and significant Further, the effect of external citations is significan(t)ly larger than that of other types of citations. Conversely, citations to prior art that is technologically near have a negative effect on forward citation frequency. These results are robust across several alternative specifications and definitions of whether each flow of knowledge is external. Important energy patents have drawn heavily from external prior art categorized as chemical, electronics, and electrical; they cite very little prior art from computers, communications, and medical inventions.

His arguments against market mimicry by public authorities do not lead him to scepticism about markets. Rather, they form part of an Austrian argument for solutions to environmental problems within actual markets themselves. In this paper I argue that it is not only shadow pricing, but the use of actual markets that is open to Austrian forms of criticism. Hayek's epistemic arguments against central planning and in defence of market economies are more ambivalent than is often supposed. The paper examines the ways in which the premises in Hayek's own arguments point in the opposite directionto the epistemic limits of markets and in particular their limitations for the resolution of environmental problems.","Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"O'Neill, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",john.f.o'neill@manchester.ac.uk,,"O'Neill, John/0000-0002-7558-0033",,,,,69,7,10,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We examine the role of alternative assumptions about the wage and price setting mechanisms for the assessment of the welfare costs of nominal rigidities and the performance of alternative monetary policy rules in an otherwise standard New Keynesian general equilibrium model. We find that the choice of a particular price and wage setting scheme matters quantitatively for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. However, the ranking of the welfare costs associated with alternative wage and price setting schemes is robust to changes in the monetary policy rule, and the ranking of the welfare costs associated with alternative monetary policy rules is robust to changes in the wage and price setting scheme. The difference between sticky nominal contracts and sticky information matters more than the difference in the age distribution of prices wages and information implied by alternative price and wage setting schemes.

I present a model that combines upstream regulation with downstream heterogeneous firms in a monopolistic competition framework, where firms can pay a fixed cost to adopt this marginal cost-reducing device. The presence of captive power affects the market equilibrium by increasing the level of idiosyncratic productivity a firm needs to survive in the market and by re-allocating sales and profits towards the more productive, adopting firms. Additionally, the rate of adoption is shown to increase with the price of electricity, industries' electricity-intensity and with higher barriers to firm entry. The mechanisms I propose are present for a cross-section of Indian firms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A sectoral growth accounting exercise shows that total factor productivity (TFP) growth was the fastest for services; moreover this TFP increase was significant in accounting for service sector value added growth. A growth model with agriculture, industry and services as three principal sectors is calibrated to Indian data using sectoral TFP growth rates. The baseline model performs well in accounting for the evolution of value added shares and their growth rates, but is unable to capture sectoral employment share trends. The performance of the model with respect to value added shares improves when the post 1991 increase in service sector TFP growth following the inception of market-based liberalization reforms is accounted for. A modified version of the model with public capital can better track trends in sectoral employment shares. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Policy implications could be that restrictive policies preventing firms from internationalizing production would weaken a country's position in global production networks, with long-term negative effects on domestic jobs and growth.","[Caffarelli, Filippo Vergara] Bank Italy, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Guerrieri, Paolo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Guerrieri, Paolo] Coll Europe, Brugge, Belgium",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; Sapienza University Rome,"Caffarelli, FV (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",filippo.vergaracaffarelli@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,30,9,9,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In particular the 1993 civil service reform introduced a two-level collective bargaining system, according to which the national collective agreements set the basic pay while the local administrative units define the wage increases depending on their own financial constraints and productive performances. In the same period the severe limitations to hire additional workers on a permanent contractual regime - the so-called block of turn-over - favoured the increase of the share of experienced workers in the public sector. In this paper we relate these institutional reforms occurred in Italy over the nineties to the evolution of public sector wage inequality. Actually we show that the 90/10 inequality index increased by 11% in the Italian public sector by using the SHIW-Bank of Italy data for the period 1993-2004. Further a quantile decomposition analysis allows us to verify that this increase of wage inequality is driven by the positive effect of the residual component in the upper tail of the wage distribution. Then we relate the increase of the residual-within wage inequality to the reforms in the wage setting system introduced in 1993 and 1998 that allow public employees with the same observable characteristics to be paid differently in different administrative units or even in the same units if assigned to different tasks.","[Naticchioni, Paolo] Univ Cassino, Fac Econ, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy; [Ricci, Andrea] ISFOL, Area Valutaz Polit Risorse Umane, I-00100 Rome, Italy",University of Cassino,"Naticchioni, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Fac Econ, Via Marconi 10, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",p.naticchioni@gmail.com; andr.ricci@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,9,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1120-2890,,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The results reveal that, overall, study households preferred compensation plans that made payment in fewer days, provided facilitated credit access and offered biosecurity training, though there was considerable heterogeneity across households.

Financial instability is driven by distributive effects. In addition to the income transfers associated with interest payments, the accumulation of debt feeds back with the distribution of income between labour and capital. The model also gives a central role to banks and credit rationing. Contrary to the existing literature, credit supply does not depend on the characteristics of borrowers, but on those of banks. There is a feedback channel between the health of the financial system and the quantity of credit in the economy. We show that there is a diversity of channels through which financial fragility may arise.

Firms simultaneously choose the number of products and their qualities at the first stage and compete in quantities at the second stage. We show that when the fixed setup cost of a product is high enough to result in a monopoly outcome, the monopolist always sells a single product. Moreover, in any equilibrium of a multiproduct duopoly, quality differentiation between them will develop into a nonsegmented pattern because each firm desires to avoid a strong effect of cannibalization. The set of equilibria reveals the properties of quality differentiation between multiproduct firms. In a multiproduct duopoly, the profit from a high-quality product can be lower than that from a low-quality product. This finding sharply contrasts with the literature on single-product firms, which finds the high-quality advantage.","[Peng, Shin-Kun] Acad Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Peng, Shin-Kun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Cheng, Yi-Ling] Tunghai Univ, Taichung 407, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; Tunghai University,"Peng, SK (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, 128 Acad Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",ylcheng@thu.edu.tw; speng@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,4,6,1,22,UNIV NORTH CAROLINA,CHAPEL HILL,"SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514 USA",0038-4038,,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Knowing whether policy is effective in achieving its goal of advancing teaching and research is critical. Furthermore, at the level of implementation, it is necessary to understand if university resource allocation is sufficiently efficient for delivering expected results. To achieve this insight, this study utilizes a two-stage data envelopment analysis to evaluate the cost and teaching and research efficiencies of public universities in Taiwan. Additionally, this paper also employs a truncated-regression to discuss whether intellectual capital affects the operating efficiency of universities. The results demonstrate that the universities are much better at handling cost efficiencies than teaching and research efficiencies. The regression analysis indicates that intellectual capital does play an important role in influencing teaching and research efficiency. Finally, the conceptual roadmap to performance improvement strategies, which helps the manager and/or authorities to improve their operating efficiencies, also is presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As a practical example, the professional competition between fund managers is considered. To explore how different settings of competition parameters, the exclusion rate and the exclusion interval, affect individual investment behavior, an evolutionary model is developed. Using a simple genetic algorithm, two attributes of virtual fund managers evolve: the share of capital invested in a risky asset and the amount of excessive risk accepted, where a positive value of the latter parameter points to an inefficient investment portfolio. The simulation experiments illustrate that the influence of competitive conditions on investment behavior and attitudes towards risk is significant. What is alarming is that intense competitive pressure generates risk-seeking behavior and undermines the predominance of the most skilled. In these conditions, evolution does not necessarily select managers with efficient portfolios. These results underline the institutional need for the creation of a competitive framework in which risk-taking does not provide an evolutionary advantage per se, and indicate measures on how to achieve this.","Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Witte, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",bjoern-christopher.witte@uni-bamberg.de,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,16,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 25,2012,6,,,,,,,,201224.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-24,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,970DX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000306109400001,0

In the baseline treatment, an overwhelming majority of parents prefer conditional transfers to larger unconditional transfers.

Our main findings are that an increase in the leftist orientation of the government leads to more restrictive or less open trade policies, while right-oriented parties are likely to express more favor to trade openness. Secondly, international factors such as globalization in political and social dimension as well as financial openness, have a strong positive influence on a given party's trade policy preferences.

While theory and interest group advocacy suggest a case for compensating Australian producers whose outputs become less competitive because Australia unilaterally prices carbon, this case is sometimes exaggerated. For example, in the ferrous metals sector, analysis suggests that gains from such refinements are low since carbon leakages and adverse competitiveness effects are small. In other sectors such as non-ferrous metals the effects are more pronounced. Exaggerating the competitiveness costs of carbon pricing risks policy overreaction and unintended protectionism, thereby reducing the net benefits from Australian carbon pricing.","[Clarke, Harry; Waschik, Robert] La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Waschik, R (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Econ, Plenty Rd, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.",r.waschik@latrobe.edu.au,,"Waschik, Robert/0000-0001-9306-1803",,,,,20,7,7,2,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,,,ECON REC,Econ.

The study argues that in contrast to the neoliberal viewpoint of mainstream discourse, the evolutionary-institutionalist (social power) approach to market construction is a more appropriate framework for assessing alternatives to the growth of authoritarianism in the region. The paper reassesses the constructivist policies of Gorbachev's perestroika from the perspective of institutionalist evolutionism and asserts that these policies still constitute a viable strategy for democratic advancement in authoritarian transition.","Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Klimina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Dept Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",,,,,,,,38,0,1,0,8,M E SHARPE INC,ARMONK,"80 BUSINESS PARK DR, ARMONK, NY 10504 USA",0021-3624,,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The Poverty Persistence Index (PPI) is based on all the pairwise distances between the waves of poverty. The PPI is normalized and it assigns a higher degree of (longitudinal) poverty to people who experience poverty in consecutive, rather than separated, periods, for whom the distances from the poverty line are larger along time and moreover, when the worst years are consecutive and/or recent. We also propose an aggregate index of persistence in poverty (APPI) in order to measure the distribution of the persistence of poverty in a society, and evaluate at once the diffusion of poverty, its depth, duration, and recentness. The indices are tested in comparison with other measures from the literature both at the individual as well as at the societal level.","[Mendola, Daria] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Finanziarie, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,"Mendola, D (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali & Finanziarie, Viale Sci,Ed 13, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",daria.mendola@unipa.it,"Mendola, Daria/AAE-4614-2020","Mendola, Daria/0000-0001-5723-7859; Busetta, Annalisa/0000-0002-5588-7433",,,,,35,19,19,0,22,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0034-6586,,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In this paper, the roots of the crisis and the way of addressing it are discussed. In particular the features, drawbacks, missed opportunities and pitfalls of the (sic)110 billion EU/IMF rescue package granted to Greece are examined. It is argued that the government's focus on taxation rather than on politically costly privatization and cutbacks in the public sector undermined economic activity in the country, decreased the government's revenue, and spawned disincentives for investment, without generating growth and without improving competitiveness. In brief, rather than contributing to economic recovery, the opposite was achieved as a result of the measures implemented by the government.","[Visvizi, Anna] Amer Coll Greece, DEREE Athens, Dept Int Business & European Affairs, Athens, Greece; [Visvizi, Anna] Aalborg Univ, SPIRIT Europe, Aalborg, Denmark; [Visvizi, Anna] Univ Warwick, Ctr Globalizat & Regionalizat CSGR, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Aalborg University; University of Warwick,"Visvizi, A (通讯作者)，DEREE Amer Coll Greece, 6 Gravias St, Athens 15342, Greece.",avisvizi@acg.edu,"Visvizi, Anna/AAF-4156-2019; Visvizi, Anna/AFV-1944-2022","Visvizi, Anna/0000-0003-3240-3771",,,,,57,18,20,0,51,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

FDI is measured according to the regional share of inward investment projects, where a distinction is made between manufacturing and services, and industries with different FDI growth profiles. The paper finds convergence in location, which is strong in manufacturing arising from a North-to-South shift in location. This seems to be related to a weakening of UK regional policy, and suggests that while policy can overcome agglomeration economies, it is not self-sustaining. In services, there is some spreading out of FDI location, but no evidence of a South-to-North shift, which has implications for regional development.","[Wren, Colin; Jones, Jonathan] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Wren, C (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",c.m.wren@ncl.ac.uk; jonathan.jones@ncl.ac.uk,,"Jones, Jonathan/0000-0003-3619-0777",,,,,39,13,13,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Each repetition employs a sample drawn from a standard subject pool of students and demographics vary across samples. We largely confirm the existence of hidden costs of control but, contrary to the original study, hidden costs of control are usually not substantial enough to significantly undermine the effectiveness of economic incentives. Our subjects were asked, at the end of the experimental session, to complete a questionnaire in which they had to state their work motivation in hypothetical scenarios. Our questionnaires are identical to the ones administered in Falk and Kosfeld's (Am. Econ. Rev. 96(5):1611-1630, 2006) questionnaire study. In contrast to the game play data, our questionnaire data are similar to those of the original questionnaire study. In an attempt to solve this puzzle, we report an extension with 228 subjects where performance-contingent earnings are absent i.e. both principals and agents are paid according to a flat participation fee.

It argues that the analysis of the US Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon did not go far enough into the tail of low-probability, high-impact scenarios, and, via its approach to discounting, it mis-estimated climate risk, possibly hugely. Given the uncertainty about estimating the SCC, the note concludes by arguing that there is in fact much to commend an approach whereby a quantitative, long-term emissions target is chosen, and the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis is then based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement to achieve that very target.","[Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Dietz, Simon] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dietz, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.dietz@lse.ac.uk,"Dietz, Simon/AAX-9362-2020","Dietz, Simon/0000-0001-5002-018X",ESRC [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G021694/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,4,5,1,6,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 24,2012,6,,,,,,,,201218.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-18,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,947SH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304449800001,0

Using a life-cycle model we show that preference for the home country, the period of adjustment after arrival, and the direct cost of migration affect the savings of migrants, age at migration, and who migrates. These results are discussed in light of wages in Canada and the Netherlands, and the characteristics of Dutch immigrants drawn from ship passenger manifests. Capital constraints delayed migration and help explain the large wage gap between the Netherlands and Canada.

To that end, we formulate a model of informative advertising and price competition where the advertising fee is endogenously determined by the interaction between two firms producing a horizontally-differentiated good and a communication platform. We find that (i) when the subscription to the medium is free, the platform asks for high prices for its advertising services, which allows firms to raise their prices to the level where the marginal potential consumer achieves zero utility and (ii) a positive subscription fee generates cross-side externalities between the firms and subscribers, which can increase or decrease the equilibrium advertising fee. In particular, under a positive advertising externality, the platform tends to charge low advertising fees, thus triggering strong price competition between firms. We also show that less product differentiation or a lower consumer valuation of the goods can increase firms' profits, so a strategic connection between the product and the media markets can substantially affect the functioning of a differentiated product market.","[Esteban, Lola; Hernandez, Jose M.] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Hernández, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",hernande@unizar.es,"Hernández, José/JKI-8418-2023","Hernández, José/0009-0006-6689-6980",,,,,16,6,8,3,37,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,,,J ECON,J.

The existing literature cannot answer this question. On one hand, sovereign default models treat income fluctuations as an exogenous endowment process with ad hoc default costs. On the other hand, emerging markets business cycle models abstract from modeling default and treat default risk as part of an exogenous interest rate on working capital. We propose instead a general equilibrium model of both sovereign default and business cycles. In the model, some imported inputs require working capital financing, and default triggers an efficiency loss as these inputs are replaced by imperfect substitutes, because both firms and the government are excluded from credit markets. Default is an optimal decision of a benevolent planner for whom, even after internalizing the adverse effects of default on economic activity, financial autarky has a higher payoff than debt repayment. The model explains the main features of observed cyclical dynamics around defaults, countercyclical spreads, high debt ratios, and key long-run business cycle moments.","[Mendoza, Enrique G.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,53,181,261,1,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

I assume that some, but not all, workers care more for their principal when they are convinced that the principal cares for them. The principal can be egoistic or altruistic. Absent worker heterogeneity, an altruistic principal signals his altruism by offering relatively weak incentives and a relatively high expected total compensation. However, the latter is not always required to credibly signal altruism. Furthermore, since some workers do not reciprocate the principal's altruism, the principal may find it optimal to write a contract that simultaneously signals his altruism and screens reciprocal worker types. Such a contract is characterised by excessively strong incentives and a relatively high expected total compensation. (C0 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) methods are applied to plant-level data over an eight year period from 1998 to 2005. This is the first comprehensive analysis (to our knowledge) of technical efficiency in the Malaysian electricity generation industry using parametric method. Our empirical results indicate that ownership, plant size and fuel type have a significant influence on technical efficiency levels. We find that publicly-owned power plants obtain average technical efficiencies of 0.68, which is lower than privately-owned power plants, which achieve average technical efficiencies of 0.88. We also observe that larger power plants with more capacity and gas-fired power plants tend to be more technically efficient than other power plants. Finally, we find that plant age and peaking plant type have no statistically significant influence on the technical efficiencies of Malaysian thermal power plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An important feature of our model is that a firm can raise the probability that a shirking worker is detected by increasing its effort or investment in the monitoring of workers. Using this model we study how a monopolist's decision with regard to employment, output and monitoring is affected by exogenous variables such as job separation rate, technological advances, market size, and unemployment benefits. Furthermore, by comparing with the competitive equilibrium we find that monopoly is associated with higher unemployment rate, smaller output, and less monitoring.

Then, a cost shock at one location may lead to reduced activity in all other locations within the firm. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze national corporate tax policy in such a setting. Our main hypothesis is that corporate taxation at the parent location not only reduces the parent's capital stock but also lowers capital stocks at affiliates abroad. Using micro data on European multinational firms, we confirm the hypothesis showing that a 10 percentage point increase in corporate tax rates is associated with a 5.6% decrease in the affiliate's capital stock. From a welfare point of view, this cross-border tax effect on the capital stock gives rise to a negative fiscal externality of corporate taxation which is empirically shown to compensate a substantial fraction of the well-known positive externality due to profit shifting.

The fiscal limits, which measure the government's ability to service its debt, arise endogenously from dynamic Laffer curves. The state-dependent distributions of fiscal limits depend on the growth of lump-sum transfers, the size of the government, the degree of countercyclical policy responses, and economic diversity. The country-specific fiscal limits imply that the market perceives the riskiness of sovereign debt issued by different countries to be different, which is consistent with the observation that developed countries are downgraded at different levels of debt. A nonlinear relationship between sovereign risk premia and the level of government debt emerges in equilibrium, which is in line with the empirical evidence that once risk premia begin to rise, they do so rapidly. Nonlinear simulations show that fiscal austerity measures that aim to balance the government budget in the short run fail to contain the default risk premium, even with sizeable cuts in government purchases; but a long-term plan for fiscal reform, if it credibly changes the market's expectation about future fiscal policies, can alleviate the rising risk premium.

A majority chose the short-term bonuses, and in order for the long-term bonus to be equally preferred it had to be about 40% higher than the four added short-term bonuses. Experiment 2 employing another 36 undergraduates introduced outcome uncertainty that more accurately reflects the choices stock investors face. The participants again choose between a long-term bonus and four distributed short-term bonuses. It was shown that uncertainty made more participants prefer the long-term bonus to the added short-term bonuses than when the outcome was certain.

Signals allow assortative matching in which the highest-quality workers send the highest signals and are hired by the best firms. Matching is considered both when wages are rigid (nontransferable utility) and when they are fully flexible (transferable utility). In both cases, equilibrium strategies and payoffs depend on the distributions of worker and firm types. This is in contrast to separating equilibria of the standard model, which do not respond to changes in supply or demand. With sticky wages, despite incomplete information, equilibrium investment in education by low-ability workers can be inefficiently low, and this distortion can become worse in a more competitive environment. In contrast, with flexible wages, greater competition improves efficiency.","Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Hopkins, E (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",E.Hopkins@ed.ac.uk,,"Hopkins, Ed/0000-0001-9809-0312",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-27-0065] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,30,40,44,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

By contrast, Morgan's (Review of Economic Studies 67:761-784, 2000) lottery mechanism is robust to the introduction of rivalry when the lottery prize is proportional to group size. The lottery mechanism can provide public goods in a large group when the public good exhibits a degree of rivalry, provided that the degree of rivalry is not too high. This suggests that the lottery mechanism can provide a broader range of public goods in a large group than the direct contributions mechanism.","[Pecorino, Paul; Temimi, Akram] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pecorino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",ppecorin@cba.ua.edu,"Pecorino, Paul/AAA-9292-2019","Pecorino, Paul/0000-0002-7659-7873; temimi, akram/0000-0002-4734-0120",,,,,13,4,5,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In this setting, taxes may be used as an instrument to offset distortions caused by producer markups. Since markups tend to be higher in industries where firms face less elastic demand, tax rates will be pushed lower in these industries. This tends to work against the familiar inverse elasticities intuition associated with the Ramsey tax rule. However, a key feature of the model is that the Ramsey rule responds to the industry demand curve (Chamberlin's DD) while the monopolistic markup is a response to the demand curve faced by firms (Chamberlin's dd). Hence, the elasticities of both these curves influence the optimal tax rate, but in opposite directions.","Univ Durham, Dept Econ, Durham DH1 3HY, England",Durham University,"Reinhorn, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ, 23-26 Old Elvet, Durham DH1 3HY, England.",reinhorn@hotmail.com,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In a context of asymmetric information at the principal's advantage, we test experimentally the principal's willingness to bias (overestimate or underestimate) the information she/he gives to her/his agent on her/his ability in order to motivate her/him to exert more effort. We find that (1) principals do bias information, and (2) agents trust the cheap-talk messages they receive and adjust their effort accordingly. Therefore, biased messages improve both the agent's performance and thus the principal's profit. This, however, does not increase efficiency. We also find that overestimation occurs much more often than underestimation. Making the signal costly in an additional treatment reduces this effect.

We then suggest to represent a life in a tree structure, where each node represents a state of life and the edges between nodes will represent possible decisions in life. In this new framework, we propose a set of axioms that imply the following family of measures of lifetime's freedom of choice: the lifetime's freedom of choice has to be evaluated by a weighted sum of all possible states of life an individual might visit, with weights representing the number of decisions the individual took to reach that state.","[Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge; Nieto, Jorge] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Ballester, Miguel A.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Nieto, J (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",jorge.alcalde@unavarra.es; miguelangel.ballester@uab.es; jnieto@unavarra.es,"Ballester, Miguel Angel Gonzalez/D-1349-2013; Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge/S-9390-2017; UNZU, FERNANDO/Y-7458-2019","Ballester, Miguel Angel Gonzalez/0000-0002-9227-6826; Alcalde-Unzu, Jorge/0000-0003-1839-6245; UNZU, FERNANDO/0000-0003-1232-8540; Unzu Martinez, Fernando/0000-0002-9479-554X",,,,,14,0,0,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Recent literature shows that child health can provide an important explanation for disparities in children's human capital development across different socio-economic groups.

We analyze data from economic experiments with preschoolers and their mothers to investigate whether child health can explain developmental gaps in children's non-cognitive skills. Our measure for children's non-cognitive skills is their willingness to compete with others. Our findings suggest that health problems are negatively related to children's willingness to compete and that the effect of health on competitiveness differs with socio-economic background.

A simple model shows how these institutions can alter both market participation and the number of sites visited, which in turn affects equilibrium prices and profits in the advertising market. When consumers have a taste for variety and advertisers are horizontally differentiated, intermediaries can alter advertising strategies in ways that reduce the value of targeting.

We show that in France, while fertility and marriage rates moved closely together before 1999, since the introduction (in 1999) of the Pacte Civil de Solidarit, (PACS)-a cohabitation contract less binding than marriage-this relationship is much weaker. Surprisingly, legal unions (defined as marriage plus PACS) and fertility continue to move together after this date. We provide evidence of the relationship between the introduction of PACS and fertility, utilizing the regional variation in the number of PACS per woman (PACS intensity) and the differences in fertility before and after 1999. We show that French Departments with high PACS intensity did not show a different trend in fertility before 1999 than those with low PACS intensity (excluding Metropolitan Paris). However, they did experience an increase in their fertility levels after the introduction of PACS. This suggests the need to collect better and more detailed data, in order to assess whether the recent increases in French fertility can be partially explained by the availability of PACS.","[Gutierrez, Emilio] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Suarez Becerra, Pablo] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Brown University,"Gutiérrez, E (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Av Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",emilio.gutierrez@itam.mx; psuarez@brown.edu,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We study robust estimation mainly for the context of heteroscedasticity or high dimension, which are up-to-date topics of current econometrics. We describe a modification of linear regression resistant to heteroscedasticity and study its computational aspects. For a robust version of the instrumental variables estimator we propose an asymptotic test of heteroscedasticity. Further we describe robust statistical methods for dimension reduction and classification analysis. We propose the robust quadratic classification analysis based on a new minimum weighted covariance determinant (MWCD) estimator. In general the robust methods based on down-weighting less reliable observations are resistant to outlying values (outliers) and insensitive to the assumption of Gaussian normal distribution of the data. The methods are illustrated on econometric data examples.","Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Comp Sci, CZ-18207 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Comp Sci, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, CZ-18207 Prague 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz,"Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",,,,,31,16,16,0,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Second, foreign direct investment in the sampled cities enhances the lending effects of foreign banks, but reduces the lending effects of other banks on the economy of Chinese cities. Third, the effects of city competitiveness are similar to those of foreign direct investment; that is, city competitiveness augments the lending effects of foreign banks but reduces the lending effects of other banks.","[Lu, Chin Hwa] China Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Shen, Chung Hua] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lu, CH (通讯作者)，China Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",chleu@cute.edu.tw; chshen01@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,28,7,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2012,20,2,,,,,59,79,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01280.x,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,919TT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000302352700004,0

To exploit the exogenous variation in firm organizational forms, we use Japanese pesticide market data. First, our empirical analysis shows that a model of imperfect competition fits the Japanese pesticide market well despite the existence of regulations. We, then, estimate the effect of organizational heterogeneity on entry behavior. Firms having capital ties with special distribution networks tend to enter this market more readily than do firms without such ties. Furthermore, diversified and vertically nonintegrated firms are more likely to enter this market than are stand-alone and vertically integrated firms. These findings suggest that markets with distribution-related, diversified, and vertically nonintegrated potential entrants are more competitive than those with the same number of potential entrants that have no such characteristics.

However, these numbers are typically calculated as if the tax system is non-distortionary. This paper presents an analogue to genuine saving in a second best economy, where the government raises revenue by means of distortionary taxation. We show how the social cost of public debt, which depends on the marginal excess burden, ought to be reflected in the genuine saving. By presenting calculations for Greece, Japan, Portugal, U.K., U.S. and OECD average, we also show that the numbers published by the World Bank are likely to be biased and may even give incorrect information as to whether the economy is locally sustainable.

Jurisdictions invest over time in infrastructure to increase the quality of the environment, a global public good. They are identical in all respects but one: initial stocks of infrastructure. This is a dynamic type of heterogeneity that disappears in the long run. Therefore, at the steady state, usual intuitions from static settings apply: identical jurisdictions inefficiently underinvest, calling for public subsidies. In the short run, however, counterintuitive properties are established: (i) the evolution of capital stocks can be nonmonotonic and (ii) one jurisdiction can be temporarily taxed, even though it should increase its investment, whereas the other is subsidized. It is shown how these phenomena are related to initial conditions and the kind of interactions between infrastructure capitals, complementarity or substitutability.","[Claude, Denis] CNRS, CES, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Figuieres, Charles; Tidball, Mabel] INRA, LAMETA, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Claude, D (通讯作者)，CNRS, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",charles.figuieres@supagro.inra.fr; tidball@supagro.inra.fr,"Tidball, Mabel/GYD-3456-2022; Claude, Denis/AAX-2904-2021","Claude, Denis/0000-0001-7901-5122; Tidball, Mabel/0000-0002-5576-0977",,,,,30,3,3,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1097-3923,,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The previous literature has found that this transparency of consequence can only improve the efficacy of the expert's decision making. We show, however, that this conclusion is very sensitive to the specified cost structure: if learning the consequences of the expert's action makes the expert more likely to choose the action most likely to correspond to the true state of the world, when costs are asymmetric, this can be associated with a decrease in the principal's expected welfare. In addition, we show that, when the prior on the state of the world is sufficiently strong, if the principal benefits from learning the consequences of the expert's action, her utility is higher if she observes only the consequences and not the action taken. For such priors, the optimal transparency regime will involve either the principal observing only the expert's action or only the consequences of the expert's action: it will never be optimal to observe both.

We introduce two main policy changes that have swept the US since the late 1970s: the approval of the joint custody regime and the Child Support Enforcement program. Because those reforms affect divorce decisions by counteracting the reallocation of property rights generated by the unilateral divorce procedure and by increasing the expected financial costs of divorce, it is arguable that their omissions might obscure the impact of unilateral divorce reforms on divorce rates. After allowing for changes in laws concerning the aftermath of divorce, we find that the positive impact of unilateral divorce reforms on divorce rates does not vanish over time, suggesting that the Coase theorem may not apply to changes in divorce laws. Supplemental analysis, developed to examine the frequency of permanent shocks in US divorce rates, indicates that the positive permanent changes in divorce rates can be associated with the implementation of unilateral divorce reforms and that the negative permanent changes can be related to the law reforms concerning living arrangements in the aftermath of divorce. This seems to confirm the important role of these policies in the evolution of divorce rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One follows cobweb logic and models fluctuations driven by expectation errors but emphasises that these expectations create complex dynamics and possibly chaos. The other stems from the rational expectations tradition of dynamics driven by real shocks. The empirical evidence tends to support the latter, but is not conclusive. The rational expectations model generates an optimal dynamic path from which no improvement can be expected from public intervention. However, if we take account of all the potential market failures in agricultural markets, and especially in developing countries, this conclusion might require some qualifications, although an appropriate policy design for stability has still to be achieved. This paper surveys the positive and normative literature on agricultural prices, highlighting empirical evidence and identifying remaining unresolved issues.","[Gouel, Christophe] INRA, Paris, France; [Gouel, Christophe] CEPII, Paris, France; [Gouel, Christophe] Ecole Polytech, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",INRAE; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Gouel, C (通讯作者)，INRA, Paris, France.",,"Gouel, Christophe/G-9859-2011","Gouel, Christophe/0000-0002-3946-5222",,,,,147,42,46,0,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Adjustment increases with income and experience, and for EITC recipients, I rule out adjustment greater than 2 percent.

On average, the younger applicant received over 3 times more responses from employers looking to hire a restaurant worker and over 4 times more responses from employers looking to hire a sales assistant than the older applicant.

They acknowledged this need very early after attaining independence some five decades ago. Unfortunately, such transformation has eluded them while success has been observed in many parts of East Asia. There are obvious questions to be asked about the different outcomes observed. In trying to find explanations for the different outcomes, the literature shows that a major difference has been the role and capabilities of the state. While the state pursued transformation through industrial policy in a systematic way in many East Asian countries, such a systematic approach has not been observed in most parts of Africa. It is obvious that African countries can learn some principles from East Asia in the pursuit of structural transformation. They can set clear goals for transformation and develop clear strategies for achieving the goals. They can also assign specific roles to institutions and individuals in the implementation of strategies. But most importantly, they must show commitment to industrial policy and stick with the agreed policies, making periodic modifications and adjustments when necessary. In choosing goals for industrial policy, African governments cannot lose sight of current capabilities and endowments. They must be guided by how they want to be positioned in a changing global economy. This is what will drive them to develop specific policies that can make them replace fast-growing East Asian economies, such as China, as they move on to other levels in their transformation. In choosing strategies, African countries need to accept that it is not simply a case of 'government versus market'. Nor is it 'horizontal versus vertical industrial policies'. They will find that 'import-substitution versus export promotion' is no longer a dichotomous issue. Being pragmatic and consistent after making the right choices is the way forward.","[Aryeetey, Ernest; Moyo, Nelipher] Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana; [Aryeetey, Ernest; Moyo, Nelipher] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Ghana; Brookings Institution,"Aryeetey, E (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana.",aryeetey@ug.edu.gh,,"Aryeetey, Ernest/0000-0002-3931-9487",,,,,36,10,12,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The source of growth explanation is important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates how the pollution consequences of growth depend on the source of growth. Therefore, the analogy drawn by some in the environmental community between the damaging effects of economic development and those of liberalized trade is, at best, incomplete. Second, the source of growth explanation demonstrates that a strong policy response to income gains is not necessary for pollution to fall with growth. The aim of this paper investigates the role of differences source of growth in environmental quality of Iran. The results show the two growth resources in Iran cause, in the early stages, CO2 emission decreases until turning point but beyond this level of income per capita, economic growth leads to environmental degradation. I find a U relationship between environmental degradation (CO2 emission) and economic growth in Iran.","Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani Univ, Esfahan, Iran",,"Asghari, M (通讯作者)，Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani Univ, Esfahan, Iran.",,,,,,,,48,18,19,0,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2012,59,5,,,,,609,623,,10.2298/PAN1205609A,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,068XA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000313398300005,0

In the experiments, subjects play two distinct games simultaneously with different opponents. We find that the strategies chosen and the efficiency of outcomes in one game depends on the other game that the subject plays, and that play is altered in predictable directions. We develop a measure of behavioral variation in a normal form game, outcome entropy, and find that prevalent strategies in games with low outcome entropy are more likely to be used in the games with high outcome entropy, but not vice versa.

During this period, the reduction of funds available for national security was in concurrence with the Dutch government's spending policies. The Netherlands Armed Forces (NAF) changed dramatically in terms of capabilities, size, equipment and personnel in this two-decade time span. Our investigative results indicate that in spite of this transition, no significant changes have been implemented since 1990 in how the Dutch defence budget is allocated for the Navy, Army and Air Force. Furthermore, the mix of expenditures for salaries, operations and maintenance, as well as those for capital investment, stayed roughly the same for the duration of the period studied.","[Beeres, Robert; De Bakker, Eric Jan; Bollen, Myriame] Netherlands Def Acad, Fac Mil Sci, Breda, Netherlands; [Westerink, Eibert] Minist Def, The Hague, Netherlands",,"Beeres, R (通讯作者)，Netherlands Def Acad, Fac Mil Sci, Breda, Netherlands.",rjm.beeres@nlda.nl,,,,,,,43,7,7,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

If investors exhibit decreasing relative risk aversion, then negative wealth shocks increase the risk premium required to hold risky assets. We integrate this into a second generation model of currency crises which allows for contagion through changes in fundamentals. Investor behavior can be a transmission channel of financial crises, as changes in risk premia increase the coverage ratio and makes the defense of a peg less attractive for the policy maker. The feedback effect of the risk premia on the probability of devaluation also makes multiple equilibria more likely. The possible stabilization effects of capital controls and a Tobin tax on the international transmission of financial crises are also studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The essential importance of services, and especially of some of their activities, consists of positive impact they produce on user activities. In this work the tertiarisation of productive systems of several European Union (EU) new and old member states, employing the input-output tables, is analyzed. To be precise, the tertiarisation effects obtained using technical coefficients and Leontief inverse matrix coefficients are thoroughly examined. Our attention is focused only on the direct and total effects. Direct effects comprise the immediate intermediate demand of each productive sector necessary to produce an additional unit of its product. On the other hand, total effects measure all the direct and indirect inputs needed to produce an additional unit of output. The main characteristics of the selected countries refers to their reduced size that can be compared to the NUTS 2 regions. The EU, establishing its regional policy, which main goal consists in the achievement of a higher level of the economic, social and territorial cohesion, takes into account regions precisely of this level. So, this analysis enables not only to compare the state of tertiarisation in the new and old European member countries, but also to approach this analysis to the territory level similar to NUTS 2 regions. The study carried out in this work, enables us, on the one hand, to appreciate the differences existing between countries from the point of view of the share of the tertiary sector in total gross value added (GVA) and from the point of view of the use of services by whole of the productive systems. On the other hand, the activities that introduce tertiary inputs into their productive processes with greater intensity are indentified. Furthermore an attempt to check if there is any relation between the activities' tertiarisation degree and their importance for national productive systems is made. The results of this work may be of great interest from the point of view of the new member states as they highlight the current situation concerning the services sector which development is essential for the achievement of Europe 2020 strategy objectives. Namely, enhancing the services performance, these countries could improve their situation concerning employment, their relation with innovation and general economic background.","[Camacho Ballesta, Jose A.; Hernandez Peinado, Manuel] Univ Granada, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Camacho Ballesta, Jose A.; Melikhova, Yulia; Hernandez Peinado, Manuel] Univ Granada, Inst Reg Dev, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada,"Ballesta, JAC (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",jcamacho@ugr.es; yumeli@correo.ugr.es; mhpeinad@ugr.es,"Camacho, José/JCE-9830-2023; Camacho-Ballesta, José A./I-1700-2015","Camacho-Ballesta, José A./0000-0002-9786-5400",,,,,26,5,5,1,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Two questions are addressed: (i) does foreign aid crowd out government spending in aid-recipient countries, and (ii) does the degree of fungibility vary across different categories of aid? Using a panel dataset of 67 countries for 1972-2000 we find that at the aggregate level about 70 percent of total aid is fungible. We also find that aid targeted for public investment crowds out about 80-90 percent of domestic government spending on public investment. Aid does not affect private investment, but has a strong positive impact on household consumption. The results are also robust to checks for causality. These findings are significant, since more than two-thirds of all aid flows to developing countries are tied to public investment projects.","[Chatterjee, Santanu] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Giuliano, Paola] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Kaya, Ilker] Amer Univ Sharjah, Tehran, Iran; [Chatterjee, Santanu] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; International Monetary Fund,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",schatt@uga.edu; paola.giuliano@anderson.ucla.edu; ikaya@aus.edu,"Giuliano, Paola/J-3159-2013; kaya, ilker/S-7910-2019","kaya, ilker/0000-0002-8666-8794",,,,,47,27,30,0,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The bargaining environment is described by a set of variables that may affect agents' preferences over the agreement sharing, the status quo outcome, or both. The outcomes (i.e. whether an agreement is reached, and if so the individual shares) and the environment (including the size of the pie) are known, but neither are the agents' utilities nor their threat points. We consider both a deterministic version of the model in which the econometrician observes the shares as deterministic functions of the variables under consideration and a stochastic one in which because of latent disturbances only the joint distribution of incomes and outcomes is recorded. We show that in the most general framework any outcome can be rationalized as a Nash solution. However, even mild exclusion restrictions generate strong implications that can be used to test the Nash bargaining assumption. Stronger conditions further allow to recover the underlying structure of the bargaining, and in particular, the cardinal representation of individual preferences in the absence of uncertainty. An implication of this finding is that empirical works entailing Nash bargaining could (and should) use much more general and robust versions than they usually do.","[Chiappori, Pierre-Andre] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Donni, Olivier] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy Pontoise, France; [Komunjer, Ivana] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Columbia University; CY Cergy Paris Universite; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Chiappori, PA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,45,9,11,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Using the panel data estimations, I find that both development strategies bring about TFPG via nonneutral technological growth, and the former more largely explains TFPG than does the latter.

However, these crowding out effects of increasing public debt have usually been found to be small or non-existent. One explanation is that on globalised bond markets interest rate differentials are offset due to financial integration. This paper tests crowding out, and measures the degree of integration of government bond markets, using spatial modelling techniques. Our main finding is that the crowding out effect of public debt on domestic long term interest rates is small: a 1% increase in the debt ratio pushes up domestic rates by 2 pp at most. Financial integration implies an important spillover effect via international bond markets, but only between OECD. and in particular EU, countries. The feedback effect from these markets on long term interest rates is as important as the domestic crowding out effect of higher public debt. Emerging markets are not as well integrated into international capital markets, causing a stronger crowding out effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Explanatory factors behind formalizing non-farm household businesses in Vietnam,JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,informal sector; Vietnam; registration; corruption; incentives,INFORMAL SECTOR,"This article sets out to investigate the reasons why some household businesses decide to register and become formal (while others do not) in order to shed light on the origins of informality. We use qualitative as well as quantitative data on household businesses (HB) derived from first-hand representative surveys implemented in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The study reveals that although most of the informal businesses operate 'illegally', this is more due to unclear registration legislation than the mark of a deliberate intention to evade the economic regulations. Among the different factors that influence the registration decisions, the reason for setting up the business appears to be a determining one: the more it is a real choice (businesses set up to be independent or to follow a family tradition) and the less a constraint (set up for lack of a job alternative), the more the HB is inclined to be registered. Furthermore, the analysis highlights that incentives do prove decisive insofar as the probability of having a formal business is greater among HB heads who consider that registration provides at least partial protection from corruption. Besides, access to information, the market and large business orders also drive the informal entrepreneurs to register. These results stress the need for clarification of the legal framework as well as incentive policies in order to address the issue of informality.","[Razafindrakoto, Mireille; Roubaud, Francois] IRD DIAL, Paris, France; [Cling, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 13, CEPN CNRS, IRD DIAL, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paris 13,"Razafindrakoto, M (通讯作者)，IRD DIAL, Paris, France.",razafindrakoto@dial.prd.fr,,,,,,,29,21,25,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

In this approach, the Lifestyle Return to Scale (LRS) parameter is defined. The first result is that an increase in a consumer's personal income may have a positive or a negative effect on health. That is, health may be a normal or an inferior good, depending on the Lifestyle Return to Scale value. According to this result, I compute a health multiplier and then modify the So low Growth Model in which health is labour-augmenting.

The extent of anchoring then serves as a proxy for the credibility of the monetary authority. Second, to assess how well this measure proxies credibility, we cross-check it against periods for which the level of credibility is known and generally agreed upon. To this end, we apply our measure to the US inflation history since 1963, which includes both the period of the Great Inflation, in which credibility was poor and deteriorating, as well as the period of the Great Moderation during which credibility in the monetary authority was gradually re-established.

However, the incentive effects of those policies are usually not explicitly addressed in empirical studies. In this article the performance in amateur golf tournaments is analysed to gain insights into the incentive effects of those types of policies. The empirical analysis takes advantage of the fact that tournaments in amateur golf are of two distinctive types that apply different scoring rules: while one scoring rule is based on gross scores, i.e. the total number of strokes of a player, the second scoring rule is based on net scores where the total number of strokes is normalized with respect to the respective player's handicap. Performance comparisons of players who participated in both types of tournaments suggest that levelling the playing field, as in tournaments based on net score, has positive and significant performance effects.","TU Dortmund, Dept Econ, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Franke, J (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund, Dept Econ, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",joerg.franke@tu-dortmund.de,,"Franke, Jorg/0000-0002-8525-1321",,,,,24,20,21,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The key element of this reform was to merge the coexisting transfer systems Social Assistance (SA) and Unemployment Assistance (UA) into one unified benefit (Arbeitslosengeld II - ALG II). We also consider a second reform scenario that is intended to further improve the labour supply incentives of low-skilled workers. Our methodological contribution is to use an integrated CGE-microsimulation model. In adopting such an approach, we are able to combine the advantages of microsimulation studies by accounting for the large amount of heterogeneity in terms of households' preferences and budget constraints with the advantages of an applied general equilibrium model. The latter permits us to identify potential general equilibrium repercussions through changes in wages and unemployment. The simulations indicate that the introduction of ALG II results in a negligible increase in employment of only 45 000 individuals. In contrast, a cut in benefit levels combined with a decrease in transfer withdrawal is shown to produce somewhat larger employment effects of about 190 000 individuals.","[Franz, Wolfgang; Guertzgen, Nicole; Schubert, Stefanie; Clauss, Markus] Ctr European Econ Res, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Schubert, Stefanie] Otto Beisheim Sch Management, D-56179 Vallendar 56179, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Guertzgen, N (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res, L 7-1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",guertzgen@zew.de,,"Schubert, Stefanie A./0000-0002-1087-1833",,,,,25,9,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Such evolution occurred in a period where the government started to have a more passive position and, producers, in turn, tried themselves to modify the production structures, adapting to the forces of the market and to the demands for internal and external competitiveness. Jordan Valley (JV) is considered as a basket of fruit and vegetables of Jordan that allows production of seasonal crops. The main constraint to agriculture in JV is water availability. Target Minimization of Total Absolute Deviation (MOTAD) model was used to evaluate three levels of water availability and these are: current normal situation, 50% and 30% water reduction. It was evident that crops behaviour under risk condition in JV differs according to the risk associated with production process, both for season and amount of water available for irrigation where the impact of water reduction was obvious in winter (spring) farming season.","[Shahwan, Yousef] United Arab Emirates Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Haddad, Akram Masoud] Al Balqa Appl Univ, Amman Univ Coll Financial & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, Amman 11110, Jordan",United Arab Emirates University; Al-Ahliyya Amman University; Al-Balqa Applied University,"Shahwan, Y (通讯作者)，United Arab Emirates Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",yousef40@hotmail.com,"Haddad, Akram/AAF-3835-2020","HADDAD, AKRAM/0000-0002-8201-3096",,,,,25,5,5,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The Fed's decisions to keep interest rates so low after 9/11 and to seize unprecedented powers in the wake of the recession that inevitably followed that earlier policy were both the latest examples of the history of the Fed's ever-increasing claims to expertise that have led to expanding powers and new and more damaging mistakes.","[Horwitz, Steven] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, Canton, NY 13617 USA",Saint Lawrence University,,,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78190-216-5,ADV AUSTRIAN ECON,,,2012,17,,,,,,61,80,,10.1108/S1529-2134(2012)0000017007,0.0,,,20,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJK95,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000328736500005,0

In a small open economy with exogenous policy, we first explain how private mitigation at a cost results in an unequal distribution of the health consequences of pollution in a manner consistent with epidemiologic studies, and consequently how the benefits and costs of trade in dirty goods interact with choices concerning private mitigation to further polarize the interests of citizens concerning environmental stringency. The economy is then embedded in a broader political economy setting, and simulated to investigate the role of private mitigation in shaping political equilibria. We show that when citizens can choose between mitigating the health consequences of domestic pollution privately and reducing pollution through public policy, the same polarization of interests underlies equilibrium policy choices in both democratic and autocratic regimes.

Moreover, significant positive effects of foreign direct investments and economic integrations produce differences in growth paths between Emerging European and Western Balkan economies. Sharp decrease of foreign inflows in 2008 determined contractions of growth rates firstly in Emerging European economies with subsequent spill-over on the Western Balkan economies during 2009.

We find that education returns for one additional year generally increase from 2.6% in 1989 to 7.9% in 2009. Education returns, however, may reflect signals of innate ability or the accumulation of human capital. Moreover, traditional ordinary least square estimates may be biased by selection problems and mix-ups of age group heterogeneity. We therefore estimate the marginal effects of schooling with increasing labour market experience using the Heckman selection model. We find that the education returns for one additional year decline with labour market experience, which supports the human capital hypothesis for all age groups except the group educated during the Cultural Revolution. Different dynamics of education returns in the four age groups are identified with the large influence of institutional reforms in the labour market, supporting the transition explanation of the evolution of education returns in China.","[Kang, Lili] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Econ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Peng, Fei] Univ Birmingham, Sch Business, Ctr Res Econ & Workpl CREW, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Tsinghua University; University of Birmingham,"Kang, LL (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Inst Econ, Sch Social Sci, Tsinghua Yuan 1, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",ll.kang@yahoo.com,"Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019; 康, 丽丽/AAC-9220-2021; Peng, Fei/A-2475-2011","Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Kang, Lili/0000-0002-4726-050X",,,,,40,7,7,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24,4,,,,,535,554,,10.1080/14631377.2012.729307,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,029HN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310485500007,0

The identification and estimation of the systems rely on the methodology of identification through heteroskedasticity. The empirical results show that each of the three variables interacts in important ways. When controlling for the reverse causation, trade promotes economic growth in high-income, low-inflation, and nonagricultural countries but has a negative impact on growth in countries with the opposite attributes. Similarly, when accounting for the feedbacks from growth, banks and stock markets have different impacts on economic growth. While banking development is detrimental to output growth, stock market development is more favorable to growth in high-income, low-inflation, and nonagricultural countries. The data also reveal coexistence of a positive effect of financial development on trade and a negative effect of trade on financial development in poorer countries. In richer countries, financial development stimulates trade openness whereas trade has an ambiguous impact on financial development.","[Kim, Dong-Hyeon] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Tamkang Univ, Dept Econ, Tamsui, Taiwan; [Lin, Shu-Chin] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Suen, Yu-Bo] Aletheia Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Tamsui, Taiwan",Sungshin Women's University; Tamkang University; Kyung Hee University; Aletheia University,"Kim, DH (通讯作者)，Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dhyeonkim@yahoo.com,"Lin, Shu-Chin/AAG-3608-2019",,,,,,78,34,36,2,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

One knows that value of goods and services grows with an increasing number of people using them. There are products that are used in conjunction with other products at the same time. The latter, when used alone, are almost worthless. Buyers who use these products make up networks. In these networks user utility grows logging in new users. The market characterized by this feature is called a network market and its positive effect of consumption is network externality. Network externality is the situation when consumer utility by good consumption increases with the number of other agents consuming the good or in other words network externality is the increase of net value of action resulting from the growth of the same number of users performing that action. In economic literature generally considered products where network externality can occur are: fax machines, telecommunication networks, credit cards, computer hardware and software, etc. There are two types of network externality: direct and indirect. The direct network externality is generated by the consumption of the same product. The indirect network externality occurs when product value is added by a growing number of substitutions. A good example of this kind is computers and their software. This effect is often called a hardware-software paradigm. The indirect network externality is related to minimum two markets. One, that is exposed to influence and the other (or others) that exposes. In economic literature it is possible to find the term cross-network externality. It is argued that this externality occurs between mobile calls and cellphone sales in the context of two-sided market. One side is cellphone calls and the other is cellphones. It is argued that the profit decline on the cost of subsidizing cellphones is offsetted by an increase in profits from sales of calls. So, this method helps to increase the demand for cellphone calls. This article presents the theoretical model of a two-sided market in a mobile communications area. The conditions of subsidization that is used in order to increase net profit are determined. The research of Lithuanian mobile calls demand is made. The main data sources of the study are reports on the electronic communications sector released by The Communications Regulatory Authority of the Republic of Lithuania (data concerning subscribers, calls' prices and quantities) and United States Department of commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (relates to price index of computers and peripherals). The main results of this estimation are introduced. The study shows that mobile calls' demand does not depend on the sales of cellphones and that subsidization of cellphones does not stimulate the sales of mobile calls. Lithuanian operators use this subsidization only as a marketing tool in order to acquire bigger market share.","Vilnius Univ, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Lickus, P (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Sauletekio Av 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",petras.lickus@ef.stud.vu.lt,,,,,,,28,1,2,0,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The low paid face a much higher risk of being in a household below relative income poverty thresholds, ranging from 7 per cent in Belgium and the Netherlands up to 1718 per cent in Austria, Estonia and Lithuania.

It opposes the prevailing understanding among economists in Bulgaria that after accession to the EU the country has become a normally functioning market economy and all its problems have to be discussed from this perspective. The Bulgarian economy, in the author's view, remains very specific in nature, the on-going transformation processes being a very important part of national economic development at present. Two conclusions follow: for economic theory - the necessity to deal with the transformation problems as a very important but neglected part of contemporary economic development; for economic policy - the necessity for economists to start talking about continuing the economic reforms (in the context of the transition from plan to market).","Varna Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Mladenova, Z (通讯作者)，Varna Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria.",z_mladenova@hotmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24,4,,,,,433,439,,10.1080/14631377.2012.729303,0.0,,,7,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,029HN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000310485500001,0

The results are used to establish a foundation for an evidence-based policy for increasing employment in a country with high unemployment, while recognising the reality of budget constraints. The article disaggregates the total tax wedge into an income tax wedge and a social contributions wedge, in order to test the argument that the main burden on labour in transition economies stems from social contributions and not from income taxation, mainly due to the dominance of unskilled jobs in those countries. We also impose a control for the introduction of the gross wage concept in 2009, which is said to have had the effect of reducing the informal economy. We find that the reduction of social contributions has a significant effect on employment in Macedonia, ranging from 0.9 to 3.1 percentage points. The effect of the income tax wedge is found to be insignificant. Moreover, the estimates relating to the gross wage concept and the associated measures provide some evidence for the view that the reform generated a transfer from the informal economy into formal employment, thus most probably shrinking the grey economy in the country.","American Univ, Coll Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia",,"Mojsoska-Blazevski, N (通讯作者)，American Univ, Coll Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia.",nikica@uacs.edu.mk,,,,,,,28,4,4,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2012,24,2,,,,,241,256,,10.1080/14631377.2012.675158,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,944CD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000304175100005,0

Under such procedures one first determines the society's deprivation for each attribute separately by aggregating the individuals' deprivation levels in terms of that attribute, and then assesses the society's overall deprivation by aggregating the society's deprivation levels for different attributes. In this paper, we argue that all such procedures are seriously flawed insofar as none of them can satisfy simultaneously three highly appealing properties: (i) anonymity, which requires that the individuals be treated symmetrically; (ii) non-invariance, which reflects the sensitivity of the society's overall deprivation to certain switches of deprivation levels between individuals; and (iii) positive responsiveness, which requires that the society's overall deprivation must increase if the society's deprivation for some attribute increases without any decrease in the society's deprivation for any attribute.","[Pattanaik, Prasanta K.] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Reddy, Sanjay G.] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Xu, Yongsheng] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; The New School; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Pattanaik, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",yxu3@gsu.edu,"Xu, Yongsheng/GZA-6022-2022","Xu, Yongsheng/0000-0002-5064-9284; Xu, Yongsheng/0000-0003-1982-0466",,,,,13,11,11,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Subsequent empirical work in many instances finds the reverse. We theorize that the sacrifice ratio increases with openness in production. When the production process is more open then changes in output lead to smaller changes in marginal costs, because costs are to a greater extent driven by exogenous factors. As a result price responses to output fluctuations are dampened and the output-inflation trade-off increases. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that greater imported commodity intensity in production increases the sacrifice ratio. Consistent with theory this relationship is stronger in fixed exchange rate regimes. Controlling for imported commodity intensity also leads to a finding of a significant negative impact of trade openness on the sacrifice ratio, consistent with Romer's original hypothesis.","[Pickering, Andrew] Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Valle, Hector A.] Banco Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala",University of York - UK,"Pickering, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",Andrew.Pickering@york.ac.uk; havs@banguat.gob.gt,,"Pickering, Andrew/0000-0003-1545-2192",,,,,43,3,3,1,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We examine how domestic and foreign firms' encounters affect the domestic firms' pricing decisions and the size of their markups within a single framework by including export orientation of firms and industries and import penetration of foreign firms in an empirical markup model specification. This model is chosen for two reasons. First, markup size measures the changes in competitive pressure, and second, it captures the evolution of price and costs, both of which are affected by effects induced by foreign competition. One of the important advantages of this paper is that it employs a data set covering the whole population of manufacturing firms registered in Slovenia. This is particularly important for studying the impact of foreign trade on industry performance.

Model diagnostics reveal that sample selection bias is significant, thereby justifying the use of this approach. Probit results reveal that the probability to choose winter maize are influenced positively by gross return, subsistence pressure and soil suitability, whereas extension contact influences choice negatively. Stochastic cost frontier results reveal that a rise in input prices and output level increases production cost as expected. Among the variables representing the production environment, soil suitability and stability of mean temperature reduce cost, whereas precipitation increases cost. The mean level of economic efficiency is estimated at 0.91, implying that scope still exists to reduce cost further by jointly eliminating technical and allocative inefficiency. Policy implications include measures to improve soil suitability, development of temperature-resistant varieties and price policies to check input price rise while boosting maize price, which will synergistically increase adoption rate as well as profitability of winter maize cultivation in Bangladesh.","[Rahman, Sanzidur] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Rahman, Md.

Little economic literature analyzes the Hubbert curve although much controversy surrounds it. This difference in emphasis by economists needs to be reconsidered critically, and towards that end, we attempt to look at both concepts simultaneously. We test whether a simple Hubbert curve model is a significant determinant of world oil price changes and whether one of the main determinants of the Hotelling principle the discount rate also affects world oil prices. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing approach is used to examine the effects of a Hubbert index variable and a Hotelling discount rate variable on the world wide price of oil. Results show the discount rate, the most important Hotelling variable, has little effect on oil prices, but that the Hubbert curve model does show a large effect on oil prices. Oil is a non-renewable natural resource par excellence, yet the results suggest that the Hotelling principle is not an important determinant for oil prices, yet the Hubbert curve and the theory surrounding the Hubbert curve is an important determinant of oil prices.

The same flexible four-parameter kappa analytical form is estimated for each region by applying Gilchrist's quantile modeling techniques and Order statistics theory. The goodness-of-fit of the chosen kappa models and the least squares estimates of their slopes (functional for inequality measure based on the rankit) are displayed by Q-Q plot for eight NUTS III regions of the Slovak Republic and are graphically and numerically compared.

Several important findings are obtained. The popularization of primary education has significantly reduced poverty in China, especially in urban areas. In contrast, the Compulsory Education Law has not been well implemented for older children in rural areas. In addition, the labor market premium for completing primary education is much larger in urban areas than in rural areas. Poor rural school quality might explain this ruralurban disparity. Effort needs to be made to further reduce poverty by ensuring adequate financial resources for primary education in poor areas and improving school quality in rural China.","Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ys337@cornell.edu,"yang, zhuo/JPK-3133-2023",,,,,,21,37,43,4,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2012,20,1,,,SI,,105,122,,10.1111/j.1749-124X.2012.01275.x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,899RZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000300835100006,0

This article provides an argument for the use of SMC as a means of deciding which countries are acting as leaders in creating a fully integrated equity market in the Asia Pacific region. A total of 12 countries in the Asia Pacific region were divided into 'Emerging Market' and 'Advanced Market' equity blocks. We examine the relative size of the speed of adjustments derived from the error correction models following the Engle-Granger two-step procedure framework and apply the Granger causality test.

First, the three variables are cointegrated for both countries, implying that a long run steady state exists. Second, there is evidence of bidirectional causality between imports and economic growth for both countries. Finally, Japan seems to experience export-led growth, while GDP growth in South Korea has a negative effect on export growth. These contrasting findings could result from export goods in Japan exhibiting greater nonprice competitive aspects, although their success fails to trigger a virtuous circle since growth fails to lead to increased exports, while for South Korea, output growth leads to a decrease in export growth suggesting a strong domestic market.","[Zang, Wenyu; Baimbridge, Mark] Univ Bradford, Sch Social & Int Studies, Dept Dev & Econ Studies, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford,"Baimbridge, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Sch Social & Int Studies, Dept Dev & Econ Studies, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.",m.j.baimbridge@bradford.ac.uk,,"Baimbridge, Mark/0000-0002-2606-0103",,,,,69,24,24,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The effects on contracting of the termination of the Canadian grain transportation revenue cap policy and of the relaxation of criteria for the release of new spring wheat varieties are also investigated. While changes to grain transportation policies are not likely to significantly affect favorable conditions for contracting, reducing constraints on Canadian farmers' access to higher yielding wheat varieties could increase the returns from growing spring wheat but decrease the likelihood of contracting for malt barley with U.S. maltsters by an average of 5.3 percentage points.","[Bekkerman, Anton; Schweizer, Heidi; Smith, Vincent H.] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Bekkerman, A (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, POB 172920, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",anton.bekkerman@montana.edu; schweizer@primal.ucdavis.edu; vsmith@montana.edu,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Participants in an experiment in Tokyo were provided varying degrees of information about the status of world and Japanese fisheries and the MSC program in sequential rounds of bidding on ecolabelled and nonlabelled salmon products. A random-effects tobit regression shows that there is a statistically significant premium of about 20 per cent for MSC-ecolabelled salmon over nonlabelled salmon when consumers are provided information on both the status of global fish stocks and the purpose of the MSC program. This premium arises from a combination of an increased willingness to pay for labelled products and a decreased willingness to pay for unlabelled products. However, in the absence of experimenter-provided information, or when provided information about the purpose of the MSC program alone without concurrent information about the need for the MSC program, there is no statistically significant premium.","[Uchida, Hirotsugu] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Roheim, Cathy A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Wakamatsu, Hiroki] Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Fisheries Socioecon Grp, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Anderson, Christopher M.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Rhode Island; Idaho; University of Idaho; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Uchida, H (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",uchida@uri.edu,"Uchida, Hirotsugu/AAD-2401-2019","Uchida, Hirotsugu/0000-0003-3675-806X",WWF-Japan; WWF-US; Asahi Breweries Foundation; Rhode Island Sea Grant; Rhode Island Agricultural Extension Service [5353],WWF-Japan; WWF-US; Asahi Breweries Foundation; Rhode Island Sea Grant; Rhode Island Agricultural Extension Service,"The authors are grateful for the cooperation of Kamewa Shouten Co.

It has been suggested that the same logic applies to any powerful institution with the ability to affect industry profits. When the aim of industry is to alter the public's perception of its product (for example, by disseminating favorable messages to the news media or via an advertising campaign, or by funding industry-friendly scientific research), the end result has been dubbed deep capture. We develop a formal model of deep capture, in which consumers have imperfect information about product quality, and a dominant producer is able to increase his profits by altering the parameters of the consumer's search problem. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of the phenomenon with a discussion of the food industry response to the obesity epidemic.","[Smith, Trenton G.] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Tasnadi, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Math, Budapest, Hungary; [Tasnadi, Attila] MTA BCE Lendulet Strateg Interact Res Grp, Budapest, Hungary",University of Otago; Corvinus University Budapest,"Smith, TG (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand.",trent.smith@otago.ac.nz,"Tasnadi, Attila/D-2373-2010; Smith, Trenton/B-5449-2008","Tasnadi, Attila/0000-0003-3252-4223; Smith, Trenton/0000-0001-6272-8871",,,,,39,5,5,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The main result is that rather than destabilizing commodity prices, as is commonly believed, portfolio speculation actually reduces price volatility. Portfolio speculation can potentially destabilize a commodity's price because the additional demand for long futures by speculators is expected to drive up the cash price during both periods of low net demand, when the cash price is below average, and periods of high net demand, when the cash price is above average. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the higher level of inventory that is associated with portfolio speculation results in a larger release of stocks during periods of high net demand. The price simulations reveal that this stock adjustment effect is strong since overall price volatility is smaller rather than larger with portfolio speculation.","[Vercammen, James] Univ British Columbia, Food & Resource Econ Grp, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Doroudian, Ali] Nidera BV, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of British Columbia,"Vercammen, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Food & Resource Econ Grp, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",james.vercammen@ubc.ca,,,Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products (SPAA) Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products (SPAA) Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"James Vercammen is a professor in the Food and Resource Economics Group at the University of British Columbia.

Production of canola is risky and competes with other crops that have varying risk reduction mechanisms. Processors develop and offer contracts with varying specifications that allow growers to reduce risk and attract canola production. In this study, preplant contracting strategies were evaluated in terms of risk and return for growers and processors. Alternative contracts include fixed-price-variety-specific with and without act-of-God provisions, and an oil-premium contract. Grower returns and processor gross margins were simulated and resulting distributions were evaluated using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. In the dominant growing region, growers would prefer fixed-price-variety-specific contracts versus contracts with oil premiums. The latter would only be preferred by crushers that are highly risk averse. The results vary regionally suggesting that contract types should vary by region to be acceptable to a broader range of growers and processors. La culture du canola aux Etats-Unis a cru considerablement au cours de la derniere decennie. Cette culture comporte des risques et rivalise avec d'autres cultures pour lesquelles divers mecanismes de reduction des risques ont ete mis en place. Les transformateurs elaborent et offrent des contrats assortis de specifications diverses qui permettent aux producteurs de reduire les risques et qui creent un attrait pour la culture du canola. Dans la presente etude, nous avons evalue, sur le plan du risque et du rendement, des strategies contractuelles pre-ensemencement a l'intention des producteurs et des transformateurs. Le premier type de contrats proposes comprend un prix fixe pour une variete specifique, avec ou sans clause en cas de catastrophes naturelles, alors que le deuxieme type est fonde sur une prime pour le canola destine a la trituration. Nous avons simule le rendement du producteur et la marge brute du transformateur et nous avons evalue les resultats sous l'angle de l'efficience stochastique. Dans la zone oU la culture du canola domine, les producteurs prefereraient des contrats assortis d'un prix fixe pour une variete specifique comparativement a des contrats comprenant un prix plus eleve pour le canola destine a la trituration. Seuls les triturateurs qui sont tres risquophobes prefereraient le deuxieme type de contrat. Les resultats varient d'une zone a l'autre, ce qui porte a croire que le type de contrat devrait varier en fonction de la zone afin de convenir a un plus grand nombre de producteurs et de transformateurs.","[Wilson, William W.; Dahl, Bruce] North Dakota State Univ Dept 7610, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Wilson, WW (通讯作者)，North Dakota State Univ Dept 7610, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Richard H Barry Hall 811,2nd Ave N, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",William.Wilson@ndsu.edu; bruce.dahl@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,16,5,5,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

However, despite its advantages over hypothetical methods, its practice might lead to a wide variety of biases. The purpose of this paper is to provide a list of key cognitive biases and design effects in food auction research and to deliver scientifically underpinned procedures in order to assess, control and reduce them. Its applicability and relevance is examined in auctions on willingness-to-pay for folate (GM) biofortified rice. Design/methodology/approach - Based on auction literature, a list of 18 biases has been developed. Experimental auctions were conducted with 252 women from Shanxi Province, China to test the occurrence of eight biases, while demonstrating measures to reduce the risk of ten biases. Findings - The results lend support for three information-related effects, i.e. confirmation bias, conflicting product information effects and a primacy bias, but not for a multiple-good valuation effect, a panel size effect, a trial winner effect and time-related sampling biases. Furthermore, there are no clear indications of social desirability bias, auction fever and a false consensus effect. Research limitations/implications - This study emphasizes the need to take into account, and measure the risk of various biases when developing, organizing and interpreting experimental auctions. Future research should further extend the list of biases and validate the study findings. Originality/value - By using a highly topical subject, this study is one of the first to address the potential risk of cognitive biases and design effects in experimental (food) auctions.","[De Steur, Hans; Vanhonacker, Filiep; Verbeke, Wim; Gellynck, Xavier] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Feng, Shuyi; Shi, Xiaoping] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Ghent University; Nanjing Agricultural University,"De Steur, H (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Hans.DeSteur@UGent.be,"Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010","Verbeke, Wim/0000-0002-9967-7104; De Steur, Hans/0000-0003-1340-0882",International Master of Science in Rural Development (IMRD) Staff Exchange Program,International Master of Science in Rural Development (IMRD) Staff Exchange Program,"This investigation received financial support by the International Master of Science in Rural Development (IMRD) Staff Exchange Program.

In a first step, using two-level linear random coefficient models of both per capita consumption and per capita income, the article assesses the impact of self-reported shocks on households' economic well-being. In a second step, the prediction model is used to calculate various measures of vulnerability to poverty, considering various types of shocks. Empirical findings show that self-reported (or observable) idiosyncratic shocks, in particular health-related shocks, have larger impact on vulnerability to poverty than observable covariate shocks. These results are in line with the fact that many households reported idiosyncratic health shocks as being the worst shocks they experienced. On the other hand, unobservable idiosyncratic shocks appear to have generally more influence on households' vulnerability to poverty than unobservable covariate ones. We also show that omitting self-reported shocks in the analysis leads to an underestimate of households' vulnerability to poverty.","[Echevin, Damien] Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Echevin, Damien] CRCELB, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Echevin, Damien] CIRPEE, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",University of Sherbrooke,"Échevin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, 2500 Bd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",Damien.Echevin@USherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,25,7,9,2,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Marginal implicit values of the quality characteristics of the Anatolian Red Hard Wheat traded in the spot market of the Polatli Commodity Exchange are determined through the hedonic price model. This model is estimated from the linear-log functional form. Results of the hedonic price model demonstrate that the quality characteristics, which are statistically significant in the determination of price, namely, the protein content, the hectolitre weight, and the grain content damaged by pests and wheat bugs, are important factors in the purchasing decisions of flour millers. As the protein content and the hectolitre weight of wheat increase by 1%, the price increases by TL 0.005 and TL 0.006, respectively. As the grain content damaged by pests and wheat bugs increases by 1%, the price of wheat drops by TL 0.0002.

Design/methodology/approach - Extending the expected profit maximization framework into a random utility model which accommodates joint decisions of information acquisition and technology adoption, the authors use the full information maximum likelihood method to yield both consistent and efficient estimates. The model is applied to a field survey collecting a sample of 141 randomly selected bananas farmers. Findings - The empirical results indicate information acquired through social network will increase the probability of adoption. Knowledge accumulation as depicted by education and farming experience is found to play a role in farmers' technology adoption, whereas disease-resistant technology trait and flavor-enriching product attribute of GM bananas also appear to be important determinants for GM seeds adoption in Taiwan. Practical implications - Empirical evidence supports significance of technology traits and product attributes in farmer's GM technology adoption, suggesting the close collaboration between industry, government and academia is the key to successful commercialization of GM crops. Social implications - Understanding the determinants of farmers' GM technology adoption can serve as the basis for promoting new biotechnology, and thus can facilitate the establishment of tenable solutions to food security issues. Originality/value - This paper is the first attempt to incorporate information acquisition into the behavioral analysis of GM technology adoption. The present study also extends previous literature by considering influential factors related to both consumers' and producers' preferences in modeling technology adoption.","[Luh, Yir-Hueih; Jiang, Wun-Ji; Chien, Yu-Ning] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chien, YN (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",chienyuning@gmail.com,,,National Science Council [NSC962815-C-002-075-H],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This research was partly supported by the National Science Council under project no.: NSC962815-C-002-075-H.

We supply a set of climate impact scenarios on agricultural land productivity derived from two climate models and two biophysical crop growth models to account for some of the uncertainty inherent in climate and impact models. Aggregation in space and time leads to information losses that can determine climate change impacts on agricultural markets and land-use patterns because often aggregation is across steep gradients from low to high impacts or from increases to decreases. The four climate change impact scenarios supplied here were designed to represent the most significant impacts (high emission scenario only, assumed ineffectiveness of carbon dioxide fertilization on agricultural yields, no adjustments in management) but are consistent with the assumption that changes in agricultural practices are covered in the economic models. Globally, production of individual crops decrease by 10-38% under these climate change scenarios, with large uncertainties in spatial patterns that are determined by both the uncertainty in climate projections and the choice of impact model. This uncertainty in climate impact on crop productivity needs to be considered by economic assessments of climate change.","[Mueller, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Robertson, Richard D.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Müller, C (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A51, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",cmueller@pik-potsdam.de,"Müller, Christoph/E-4812-2016","Müller, Christoph/0000-0002-9491-3550","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); British government; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LS1201A]; KULUNDA [01LL0905L]; FACCE MACSUR project [031A103B]; BMBF","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); British government; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); KULUNDA; FACCE MACSUR project; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work has been conducted under the framework of AgMIP and ISI-MIP.

The paper reaches this conclusion using a multisectoral and multihousehold general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy. The negative effect on poor consumers, operating through their living costs, outweighed the positive effect on poor farmers, operating through their incomes. Indonesia's post-2004 rice import restrictions shielded its internal rice market from the temporary world price increases, muting the increase in poverty. But it did this only by imposing large and permanent increases in both domestic rice prices and poverty incidence. Poverty incidence increased more among rural than urban people, even though higher agricultural prices mean higher incomes for many of the rural poor. Gains to poor farmers were outweighed by the losses incurred by the large number of rural poor who are net buyers of food, and the fact that food represents a large share of their total budgets, even larger on average than for the urban poor.

However, the perceived competitions with formal financial institutions and concerns about financial risks in the rural economy have impeded the development of microfinance by NGOs in China. Despite these concerns about NGO microfinance, little empirical evidence has been brought to prove them. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence of the relationship between NGO microfinance and farmers' demand for formal and informal credit in rural China. Design/ methodology/ approach - The study is based on a household longitudinal data set consisting of 749 households from 40 microfinance villages in rural China. This study draws evidence from China's largest NGO microfinance. Out of the five county branches where China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation has launched institutionalized microfinance since 2006, the authors selected two of them. A random sampling approach was applied in surveying villages and households. In an effort to create impact assessments, the authors surveyed the detailed information on household characteristics and credit access during the period 2006-2009. A panel data is thus structured for the analysis. Findings - The authors found that the demand for credit in rural China is immense and rising, as formal financial institutions have gradually moved away from less developed regions in rural areas. In its place, informal lending has become a primary source of credit for the poor. However, where NGO microfinance has become available, both formal and informal credit has slowed down. The development and expansion of NGO microfinance did stand up as a substitution for institutional lenders and informal financial networks. Research limitations/ implications - The findings have profound policy implications. First, since the development of NGO microfinance fill the demand for credit in rural China and poses low financial risk, the intellectual bias against NGO microfinance is unwarranted. In particular, the regulations that hamper the development of NGO microfinance should be corrected. Second, informal networks do not appear to be costless. Where NGO microfinance can substitute for them, it can mitigate the financial stresses related to the informal credit market.","[Xiang, Cheng; Jia, Xiangping; Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Jia, XP (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xpjosephjia@gmail.com,"Xiang, Cheng/JSL-4858-2023","Xiang, Cheng/0000-0001-8267-4268","41st Scientific Research Foundation (SRF) for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (ROCS), State Education Ministry of China (SEM)","41st Scientific Research Foundation (SRF) for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (ROCS), State Education Ministry of China (SEM)","The authors are especially grateful to the survey team members who contributed in collecting and cleaning data.

In particular, we use a choice experiment to determine preferences for the development of farmland walking trails. Our modelling approach uses a series of mixed logit models to assess the impact of alternative distributional assumptions for the cost coefficient on the welfare estimates associated with the provision of the trails. Our results reveal that using a mixture of discrete and continuous distributions to represent cost heterogeneity leads to a better model fit and lower welfare estimates.

We find that the persistence of shocks can vary widely depending on the individual commodity and the time period.

Design/methodology/approach - The Modified Taiwan Agricultural Sector Model (Modified TASM), based on price endogenous mathematical programming, was used to simulate different agricultural policies related to bioenergy production. To do this simulation, the TASM model was extended to include additional bioenergy production possibilities and GHG accounting. Findings - Taiwan's bioenergy production portfolio depends on prices of ethanol, electricity and GHG. When GHG prices go up, ethanol production decreases and electricity production increases because of the relatively stronger GHG offset power of biopower. Originality/value - Taiwan is interested in producing bioenergy but only limited information is available. This study provides the information on potential bioethanol and bioelectricity production from various energy crops, GHG emission offset from bioenergy, and regional energy security.","[Kung, Chih-Chun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [McCarl, Bruce] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Cao, Xiaoyong] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xie, Hualin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of International Business & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Kung, CC (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Nanchang, Peoples R China.",cckung78@hotmail.com,"McCarl, Bruce A/E-9445-2011","Xie, Hualin/0000-0002-4951-4526","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41161087, 41061049]; Art & Social Science of University Foundation of Jiangxi Province [JJ1208]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [11YJ53]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Art & Social Science of University Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province,"This study is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41161087; No. 41061049), Art & Social Science of University Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. JJ1208) and Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 11YJ53).",,42,11,11,1,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The agricultural labour requirement function is estimated by the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) with China's prefecture-level data. Surplus labour or inefficient labour is obtained by subtracting the required labour from the actual labour participated in agriculture. Findings - The authors' analysis indicates that the existing size of agricultural surplus labour in rural China is still significantly large with the continued practice of the household registration system and China's WTO membership. However, the size has been decreasing over the last decade. Research limitations/implications - Quality of data might affect the authors' estimates. Practical implications - The phenomenon of the coexistence of surplus agricultural labour and shortage of workers in non-agricultural production in urban China was discussed in line with the authors' research findings, as this has important impacts on the policies of rural industrialization in China. Social implications - This paper further argues that China is probably experiencing the second stage of the Lewis-Fei-Ranis dualistic economic framework. Originality/value - The authors' paper is probably the first to use prefecture data and SFA for panel data study of surplus agricultural labour in China. The analysis is essential to the understanding of the rural labour market during its rapid transition.","[Kwan, Fung; Zhuo, Shuaihe] Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Taipa, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Crawley, Australia",University of Macau; University of Western Australia,"Kwan, F (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Econ, Taipa, Peoples R China.",FungKwan@umac.mo,"shuaihe, zhuo/AAK-6956-2020; Zhuo, Shuaihe/C-5014-2018; Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","shuaihe, zhuo/0000-0001-7826-6739; Zhuo, Shuaihe/0000-0001-7826-6739; Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",,,,,29,9,9,2,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

On the occupational choice of return migration in rural China,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Self-employment; Wage-employment; Return migration; Employment; Rural areas; China,ENTREPRENEURSHIP; EXPERIENCE; MIGRANTS; SAVINGS,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to quantify the impact of return migration on the occupational choice in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - The authors' research uses the two-stage residuals inclusion estimation, 2SRI, to deal with the endogeneity problem, and then compares the occupational choice between returnees and stayers with multinomial logit estimation and counterfactual analysis. Findings - The authors mainly find that: the migration experience has a significant positive impact on wage-employment activities, but may be has a negative effect on the entrepreneurial activities. The workers engaged in non-agricultural activities (self-employment and wage-employment) have the same characteristics in the labor market (Le. younger, male, higher education levels, less average land and parents with little children) compared to the agricultural activities, but these characteristics show no significant affect on the occupation choice between self-employment and wage-employment Research limitations/implications - This paper extends the empirical analysis in internal migration, but it also has some drawbacks, such as not enough data can be obtained to distinguish the occupations between different types of self-employment as own account workers and as entrepreneurs. Further research needs more comprehensive data to support. Originality/value - The authors' research is the first study which uses self-selection model to examine the activity choice of return migrants in rural China. They also extend the existing studies in two directions: first, they use nationally-representative data from the general social survey of China carried out in 2006 to examine the relationship between the return rural migrants and their occupational choices. Second, they propose a more exact category for rural occupational choice including non-agricultural activities (self-employee, wage-employment) and agricultural activities (peasants).","[Wang, Zi-cheng; Yang, Wei-guo] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Wang, ZC (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangzicheng999@yahoo.com.cn,"Yang, Wei/HIA-0360-2022; Yang, Wei/GWV-4107-2022",,,,,,24,15,18,8,87,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In a country where agriculture is the largest water user, some irrigation management companies have implemented innovative pricing systems to handle this situation. The objective of this article is to analyze the impact of these new management systems on farmers incomes, the revenue of the management companies, and the amount of water used. To do that, we develop a methodology using a stochastic model that simulates the representative farmer's optimal behavior in a context of climatic variability. An empirical application is made with a crop growth model and data collected from the Midi-Pyrenees region. The results show that using these specific nonlinear pricing systems allow irrigation water managers to reduce the impact of drought on production. Moreover, the type of pricing implemented depends on the characteristics and capabilities of the water company. More particularly, these pricing systems can be used to anticipate agricultural water demand in order to avoid imbalance with water availability.","[Sidibe, Yoro] LAMETA Univ Montpellier 1, Montpellier Supagro Dpt SESG 2, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France; [Terreaux, Jean-Philippe] UR ADBX, Irstea, F-33612 Gazinet Cestas, France; [Tidball, Mabel] Montpellier Supagro Dpt SESG 2, LAMETA INRA, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France; [Reynaud, Arnaud] Univ Toulouse 1 Sci Sociales, LERNA INRA, Toulouse, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; INRAE; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole,"Sidibé, Y (通讯作者)，LAMETA Univ Montpellier 1, Montpellier Supagro Dpt SESG 2, Pl Pierre Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France.",yoro.sidibey@supagro.inra.fr,"Tidball, Mabel/GYD-3456-2022","Tidball, Mabel/0000-0002-5576-0977",ANR RISECO project [ANR-08-JCJC-0074-01]; NOVIWAM project (European Union) [245460]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0074] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),ANR RISECO project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); NOVIWAM project (European Union)(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful for the financial support from the ANR RISECO project ANR-08-JCJC-0074-01 and from the NOVIWAM project (European Union - Grant agreement FP7-REGIONS n: 245460).

These shocks affect food importers and exporters alike. Vietnam is a major exporter of rice, and rice is also a key item in domestic production, employment, and consumption. Accordingly, rice price shocks from the world market have general equilibrium impacts and as such, their implications for household welfare are not known ex ante. In this article, we present a framework for understanding the direct and indirect welfare effects of a global market shock of this kind. We quantify transmission of the shock from global indicator prices to domestic markets. Then we use an applied general equilibrium model to simulate the economic effects of the price changes. A recursive mapping to a nationally representative household living standards survey permits us to identify in detail the ceteris paribus effects of the shock on household incomes and welfare. In this analysis, interregional and intersectoral labor market adjustments emerge as key channels transmitting the effects of global price shocks across sectors and among households.","[Coxhead, Ian; Le Dong Tam] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Vu Hoang Linh] World Bank Vietnam, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; The World Bank,"Coxhead, I (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Taylor Hall,427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",coxhead@wisc.edu,,"VU, LINH/0000-0002-5096-8584; Coxhead, Ian/0000-0001-6958-038X","Ford Foundation, Hanoi","Ford Foundation, Hanoi","The authors thank participants at a workshop on Food Security in Asia held at FAO-Bangkok in February 2010, seminar participants at Osaka University Institute for Social and Economic Research, the Danish Institute for International Studies, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the editor of Agricultural Economics and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

Because management decisions often have to be made on a time horizon longer than the time until expiration of the nearby futures contract, it is important to determine how well distant-delivery futures contracts are able to assist in price discovery. We focus on soybean and live cattle distant-delivery futures contracts and test for the informational value added to nearby contracts. Two tests for information value provide partially conflicting results clue to the different information measures employed. If being able to predict the price trend is sufficient, then we find some information value in distant-delivery futures contracts, while if accurate point estimates of future spot prices are desired the results are negative.

The shares of corn and ethanol price variability directly attributed to volatility in the crude oil market are generally between 10%-20%, but reached nearly 45% during the financial crisis, when world demand for oil changed dramatically. Volatility transmission is also found from the corn to the ethanol market, but not the opposite.

But their indiscriminate use can impact negatively agricultural productivity, human health, and the environment. Recently, attention is focused on the use of economic incentives to reduce pesticide use and its related indirect effects. The aim of this work is to assess the effectiveness of different economic instruments such as taxes and levies in encouraging farmers to decrease pesticide use and their environmental spillovers. A policy simulation model is employed using data from Dutch cash crop producers including two pesticide categories that differ in terms of toxicity and pesticides environmental spillovers. Four different instruments were selected for evaluation: pesticide taxes, price penalties on pesticides environmental spillovers, subsidies, and quotas. The results of the study indicate that even high taxes and penalties would result in a small decrease in pesticide use and environmental spillovers. Taxes that differentiate according to toxicity do not lead to substitution of high- with low-toxicity pesticides. Subsidies on low-toxicity products are not able to affect the use of high-toxicity products. Pesticide quotas are more effective in reducing pesticide use and environmental spillovers.","[Skevas, Theodoros; Stefanou, Spiro E.; Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Wageningen University & Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Skevas, T (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",theodoros.skevas@wur.nl,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Stefanou, Spiro/0000-0001-8366-6577",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"The authors acknowledge the support by the EU-funded project, TEAMPEST, a collaborative project in the Seventh Framework Programme Theme 2: Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Biotechnology (http://www.eng.auth.gr/mattas/teampest/).",,39,49,57,1,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Beyond price and taste, brand names, convenience, and increasingly diet-health-related cues are regarded as key attributes in attracting consumer demand. This paper applies a hedonic pricing model to a large panel of consumer packaged food products to estimate monetary value of brand, convenience, and other quality attributes in processed meat and seafood products using 200006 Nielsen aggregate weekly scanner data. We find evidence of consumer preferences for perceived natural and health attributes over products with higher degrees of processing. The results further indicate that the process of adding value to food products is intricate and dependent on multiple other indicators of product quality, not least health. As such, frozen natural chicken and seafood products may be considered by certain consumers as substitutes for fresh meat and seafood. This finding may carry further implications for the pricing and marketing of lower-value products.","[Ahmad, Waseem; Anders, Sven] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Anders, S (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",waseem@ualberta.ca; sven.anders@ualberta.ca,,"Anders, Sven/0000-0001-8261-6973",Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency; Agriculture Funding Consortium; Consumer and Market Demand Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency; Agriculture Funding Consortium; Consumer and Market Demand Research Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the access to Nielsen Canada proprietary and confidential Market Track data through financial support provided by the Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency, the Agriculture Funding Consortium, and the Consumer and Market Demand Research Network funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.",,66,35,40,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Design/methodology/approach - The neoclassical trade theory indicates that differences in both technology levels and factor endowments can explain the international trade pattern. In terms of a neoclassical framework based on the restricted profit function, this paper employs the province-level panel data to investigate whether China's agricultural foreign trade pattern is consistent with the neoclassical explanation. Findings - The findings indicate that China's agricultural foreign trade pattern is evidently characterized by regional specific features. In the eastern region, agricultural foreign trade pattern is jointly determined by differences in technology levels and factor endowments. Agricultural foreign trade patterns are driven in the central and western regions by land and capital endowments, respectively. The findings also imply that the utilization of comparative advantage in China's agriculture needs to be exploited further. Originality/value - As far as the author knows, this paper is the first to apply the neoclassical framework based on the restricted profit function and employ the province-level panel data to investigate the determination of China's agricultural foreign trade pattern.","[Li, Xilin] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xilin] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ & Technol Change ZEF B, Res Dev Ctr, Bonn, Germany",Renmin University of China; University of Bonn,"Li, XL (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lixilin2005@yahoo.com.cn,"li, xilin/HZL-0926-2023",,"China Scholarship Council; Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn","This paper has been partially supported by the China Scholarship Council and by the Center for Development Research (ZEF), the University of Bonn.

Farmers may respond to increased water scarcity along three main adjustment margins: amove towards rain-fed agriculture (super-extensive margin) or towards less water-intensive crops (extensive margin), and a reduction in water intensity for irrigated crops (intensive margin). Using a positive mathematical programming model of regional supply calibrated to economic and agronomic information, we decompose the total effect of reduced water availability on these adjustment margins in Beauce, a productive cereal region that relies on a groundwater resource to meet its irrigation needs. For realistic water scarcity scenarios, 57 per cent of the total response is attributable to super-extensive margin adjustments. The extensive margin represents 28 per cent of the total response, while the intensive margin accounts for 15 per cent. Crop-level analysis reveals more subtle adaptation patterns.","[Graveline, Nina] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, Montpellier, France; [Merel, Pierre] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Mérel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",prmerel@ucdavis.edu,"Graveline, Nina/AAG-5114-2020","Graveline, Nina/0000-0002-7976-0007",,,,,66,42,46,2,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A substantial increase in the prevalence of obesity has contributed to this growth. In this study we measure the external cost of obesity in the form of publicly funded health-care expenditures, and how this cost changes when the distribution of obesity in the population changes. We use a continuous measure of obesity, Body Mass Index (BMI), rather than discrete BMI categories to represent the distribution of obesity and changes in it. We predict that a one-unit increase in BMI for every adult in the United States would increase annual public medical expenditures by $6.0 billion. This estimated public cost equates to an average marginal cost of $27 per year, per adult for a one-unit increase in BMI for each adult in the U.S. population-or $4.35 per pound. Separately, we estimate that if every U.S. adult who is now obese (BMI a parts per thousand yen30) had a BMI of 25 instead, annual public medical expenditures would decline by $166.2 billion (in constant 2009 dollars), or 15.2% of annual public medical expenditures in 2009. Assuming a socially optimal BMI of no more than 25, we estimate that the prevalence of obesity in 2009 resulted in a deadweight loss of $148.2 billion in 2009.","[MacEwan, Joanna P.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,,Joanna.MacEwan@precisionhealtheconomics.com,,,,,,,41,14,22,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Using data from the Monitoring and Analyzing Food and Agricultural Policies program, this paper reports nominal rates of protection (NRPs) for rice and cotton at wholesale and farm level in selected African countries between 2005 and 2010. Rice is an import that has received high levels of border protection by the governments concerned while cotton is a key export crop which has been the focus of direct and indirect public intervention. For both commodities, we provide evidence for both market and nonmarket failures. In the case of rice, these prevent border protection from reaching farmers while raising consumer prices. Cotton ginning and marketing is concentrated in a small number of private sector companies in most countries studied. The farm level NRPs provide evidence of market failure in these countries that may be mitigated by policies that set indicative prices and encourage competition. The NRPs indicate nonmarket failure in the two countries that maintain parastatal monopsonies for cotton.","[Short, Cameron; Balie, Jean] Food & Agr Org UN, Agr Dev Econ Div, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Barreiro-Hurle, Jesus] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Enterprise & Ind, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Short, C (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org UN, Agr Dev Econ Div, Via Terme Caracalla 100, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",jesus.barreiro-hurle@ec.europa.eu; jean.balie@fao.org,"barreiro-hurle, jesus/A-7042-2008","barreiro-hurle, jesus/0000-0002-6422-6047",Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR),The authors would like to thank their colleagues at the FAO and in the participating countries on whose research this paper is based.

Our results show that energy prices have an effect on both types of margins. Increasing energy prices would affect crop selection decisions, crop acreage allocation decisions, and farmers' demand for water. Our estimated total marginal effect, which sums the effects on the intensive and extensive margins, suggests that a $1 per million btu increase in the energy price would decrease water extraction by an individual farmer by 5.89 acre-feet per year, a decrease of 3.6 percent of the average annual extraction rate.

Understanding the capacity of society or consumers to adapt to such changes requires understanding the responsiveness of water demand to price changes. We estimate the price elasticity of residential water demand in Phoenix, Arizona, which is likely to be strongly impacted by climate change. Most existing approaches to the estimation of water demand functions have limited capacity to isolate the effect of price on water consumption where there is little variation in water price. A recent study by Klaiber et al. (2012) attempts to address this issue by using differences in consumption levels, and weather-related characteristics to isolate the price effect on water demand, and by using a constant term in a differenced regression model. We also estimate a differenced regression model, but include direct measures of changes in water prices. This inclusion successfully isolates the price effect on water demand, and enables us to distinguish between the short- and long-run price elasticity of water demand, and hence the short-and long-run adaptation to changes in water availability.","[Yoo, James] Bethany Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Bethany, WV 26032 USA; [Simonit, Silvio] Int Union Conservat Nat, Sustainable Land Management, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Kinzig, Ann P.; Perrings, Charles] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Yoo, J (通讯作者)，Bethany Coll, Dept Econ & Business, Bethany, WV 26032 USA.",jyoo@bethanywv.edu,,,National Science Foundation [0836046],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This publication was made possible by grant number 0836046 from the National Science Foundation, but its contents are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the National Science Foundation.",,34,37,39,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We then develop a partial equilibrium model of the world's oilseed value chain and simulate the total elimination of DETs in Argentina and Indonesia, as well as the independent removal of export taxes at various stages of production in the same countries. Estimations show that removing export taxes along the entire value chain in Argentina and Indonesia reduces the local production of biofuels by only 0.4% in Argentina, while eliminating only the export tax on biofuels in Argentina leads to a 9.6% volume increase in Argentinean biofuels production.","[Bouet, Antoine] Univ Bordeaux, Talence, France; [Bouet, Antoine; Estrades, Carmen; Laborde, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC USA",Universite de Bordeaux; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Bouët, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Talence, France.",a.bouet@cgiar.org,"Estrades, Carmen/JXM-3871-2024","Estrades, Carmen/0000-0003-1996-6502; Bouet, Antoine/0000-0002-8020-8877",,,,,27,9,10,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Such harm may arise if speculators cause prices to systematically differ from the price sequence that would arise in markets populated by equally informed traders with rational expectations (RE). We show theoretically that, when traders exhibit differences of opinion (DO) about the expected value of the commodity, futures prices may diverge from the RE equilibrium. Moreover, we develop a testable prediction, namely that positions held by different trader groups are correlated with prices in a DO equilibrium but not correlated in a RE equilibrium. We find strong empirical support for the DO-type environment; changes in positions held by managed money traders are positively correlated with prices, and changes in positions held by producers are negatively correlated. In the context of our DO model, this finding implies that prices change by more on average than producers think they should and by less than managed money thinks they should. However, the evidence suggests that neither group is systematically more prescient than the other.","[Fishe, Raymond P. H.] CFTC, Washington, DC 20581 USA; [Fishe, Raymond P.

A destination has to be looked on as a complex product of tourism consisting of products, services, natural resources, artificially created attractions and information being connected. The satisfaction of visitors to a destination is dependent on the quality of their overall experience that is created on the basis of the cooperation of all participants working in tourism in the given area - these are local inhabitants, service providers, public administration workers and destination management workers. The paper shows possible approaches towards the complex evaluation of the destination quality. The first of the models is based on the European Consumer Satisfaction Index methodology and modifies it for evaluating the satisfaction of a visitor to a destination (in the researched destination, the values of the total ECSI indexes were calculated at 70% level in the case of home as well as foreign visitors). The second model - so-called Four-dimensional model of the destination quality - is based on the integrated approach to quality management when - with the support of the principal component analysis - a new methodology for evaluating the quality of a destination was suggested; it is based on four topically defined quality dimensions: attractions, services, marketing management, cooperation and sustainability.

Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review was captured to provide the evidence of potential benefits of GM cotton. A country-specific analysis was conducted in order to compare economic indicators and employed meta-analysis to find out the significance of the different of GM cotton over its counterpart. Findings - This paper depicts positive impact of commercialized GM cotton in terms of net revenue, and the benefits, especially in terms of increased yields, are greatest for the mostly farmers in developing countries who have benefitted from the spill over of technology targeted at farmers in industrialized countries. Research limitations/implications - Due to the variability of the data which came from different methodologies, it is difficult to determine the differences of the performances each individual study. Practical implications - This, it is believed that results from this study can be useful for operations of all sizes as the authors think about what needs to be focussed on for long-term producers survival. Originality/value - The paper clearly indicates that China is the highest cotton yield of GM cotton, the lowest cost of GM seed and the lowest cost of chemical spray compare to any other countries. Therefore, this is the fact that the adoption of GM cotton has been widely spread among the farmers across the regions in China.","[Witjaksono, Julian; Wei, Xiaowen; Mao, Suchun; Gong, Wankui; Li, Yabing; Yuan, Youlu] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Cotton Res, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Anyang 455000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Witjaksono, Julian] Assessment Inst Agr Technol, Dept Agr, Kendari, Indonesia","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Cotton Research, CAAS","Yuan, YL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Cotton Res, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Anyang 455000, Henan, Peoples R China.",yuanyl@cricaas.com.cn,"Gǒng, Wànkuí/AAL-5622-2020; Witjaksono, Julian/K-6268-2016","Gǒng, Wànkuí/0000-0002-8556-0669; Witjaksono, Julian/0000-0002-9186-6779","China Scholarship Council, through The Institute of Cotton Research, Anyang, China","China Scholarship Council, through The Institute of Cotton Research, Anyang, China(China Scholarship Council)","The authors thank reviewers of the China Agriculture Economic Review for their useful comments, and also acknowledge the nancial support provided by China Scholarship Council, through the research work at The Institute of Cotton Research, Anyang, China.",,112,8,9,7,73,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Although coffee is becoming more popular in China, the concept of fair trade is often found unfamiliar to most Chinese consumers. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 564 consumers were interviewed in Hubei, China. The key survey question asked consumers' willingness to purchase a cup of fair trade coffee compared to a traditional cup of coffee. A modified payment card approach was used to elicit WTP. Before answering the purchase question, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three different information scenarios: basic definition, impact on sustainability and the environment, and information including both environmental and social implications. Findings - Results indicated that consumers were generally willing to pay additional amount for fair trade coffee. Information played an important role in determining what types of consumers were responsive to fair trade coffee. Furthermore, the amount of information provided and consumer WTP did not follow a linear relationship. Practical implications - Results obtained in this study are useful for coffee marketers to better target their promotion strategies. Originality/value - In contrast to China's fast growing coffee market, little is known about consumer preferences and far less on fair trade coffee. This study is the first of its kind to understand Chinese consumers' preferences for coffee in general and for fair trade coffee in specific.","[Yang, Shang-Ho] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Tai Zhong, Taiwan; [Qing, Ping] Univ Agr, Coll Econ Management & Land Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wuyang] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY USA; [Liu, Yun] Zhongnan Univ Finance & Law, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China",National Chung Hsing University; University of Kentucky; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Qing, P (通讯作者)，Univ Agr, Coll Econ Management & Land Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",qingping@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,"Liu, Yun/0000-0003-2076-7519",,,,,15,11,11,1,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

First, what are the determinants of the disadoption decision, and do they differ from those of the adoption decision? Second, do the earnings of disadopters differ from those of current adopters? Using a nationally representative dataset of U.S. dairies from 2010, a bivariate probit model with partial observability and an endogenous switching model is estimated. Consistent with other studies, the results show that rbST use does not have a statistically significant effect on dairy profitability. However, within the group of producers who have adopted rbST, I present some empirical evidence that disadopters are doing worse off than those who are still using rbST.","Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"An, H (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",henry.an@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,23,3,5,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Following this approach, we propose a generalisation of the mixed logit model, whereby the distribution of marginal utility coefficients of a stated non-attender has a potentially lower mean and lower variance than those of a stated attender. Model comparison shows that our shrinkage approach fits the data better and produces more reliable WTP estimates.

Since most agricultural GHG emissions originate from non-point sources, they cannot be directly measured, and therefore have to be derived by calculation schemes (indicators). We designed five such GHG indicators for dairy farms and analyzed the trade-offs between their feasibility, measurement accuracy, and level of induced abatement costs. Analyses of induced abatement costs and calculation accuracy are based on emission reduction simulations with a highly-detailed single-farm optimization model. Feasibility is discussed in a qualitative manner. Our results indicate that the trade-offs depend on both farm characteristics and the targeted reduction level. In particular, the advantages of detailed indicators decrease for higher abatement levels. Only the least feasible indicator led to abatement costs that would result in emission efforts at given prices in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, although with a rather small potential. Our results thus suggest little potential for including dairy production into market-based reduction policies.","[Lengers, Bernd; Britz, Wolfgang; Holm-Mueller, Karin] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Lengers, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany.",bernd.lengers@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823",German Science Foundation (DFG) [HO 3780/2-1],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The research is funded by a Grant from the German Science Foundation (DFG), reference number HO 3780/2-1.",,71,12,12,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Overall, Californians had inaccurate knowledge about the prevalence of genetically engineered foods, and stated they were willing to pay up to 13.8% higher food costs on average for a mandatory label.

In particular, we investigate the relative roles of nonfarm incomes and productivity improvements achieved via changes in crops versus improvements on the same crops on income dynamics. Framing the article in the context of an optimal labor allocation model, relying on unique household panel data from Central Sulawesi, and using advanced panel econometric methods, we find that local innovations related to the adoption and intensification of new cash crop varieties, more specifically the shift from coffee to cocoa production, can explain a substantial part of the observed post-crisis developments. Causal estimates of the effect of growing cocoa suggest that households were on average able to achieve about 14% higher income levels during the post-crisis period compared to the planting of other crops, most notably coffee. Also, our results demonstrate the importance of engagement in nonfarm activities for household income growth. Comparative analyses using a nationally representative survey suggest that similar processes are at play in other parts of Indonesia.","[Klasen, Stephan; Priebe, Jan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan; Priebe, Jan] Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth Developing &, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Rudolf, Robert] Korea Univ, Div Int Studies, Seoul 136701, South Korea",University of Gottingen; Korea University,"Priebe, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jpriebe@uni-goettingen.de,,"Rudolf, Robert/0000-0003-1956-0457",German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank Emre Eytimur, Matin Qaim, Stefan Schwarze, as well as participants of the 4th Annual International Conference of the German Economic Association's Research Committee on Development Economics and of the CRC-PEG Inaugural Conference for valuable comments.

Exercising short-run oligopsony power is inimical to the long-run interests of buyers in these settings because below-competitive returns will lead to the exodus of resources from input production.

Intolerance of ambiguity as a personal trait proved to be a significant variable explaining collaborative strategies, whereas fear of negative evaluation by others did not significantly affect the choices made. In the repeated game context, the time taken to converge from limited to full collaboration was longer than that needed to dissolve the full collaboration owing to deviating behavior of the other party.

Theory suggests that with non-constant risk aversion, risky decisions can be influenced by both the level of expected wealth (i.e. the wealth effect) and the variability of wealth (i.e. the insurance effect). Unlike previous approaches, this article is able to extend a framework developed by Chavas and Holt to formally incorporate the insurance effect into the acreage allocation decisions. By applying the theoretical model to acreage data in the Canadian Prairies, the results reveal that the whole farm income stabilisation programmes had large impacts on acreage choices through wealth and insurance effects. From a WTO perspective, the results underline the inherent difficulty in designing programmes that will reduce the risk faced by farmers without altering behaviour.","[Bakhshi, Samira; Gray, Richard S.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Bakhshi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",samira.bakhshi@usask.ca,,"Gray, Richard Stanley/0000-0002-2073-3987",,,,,39,2,2,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Mixed effect logistic regression models are estimated to identify the most important farm and farmer characteristics that trigger insurance use. In addition, information on local hail risk is taken into account in these models. It shows that larger farms, with specialization in crop production, and with larger local hail risks are more likely to adopt the hail insurance. Moreover, insurance users are usually older and better educated. Since the early 1990s, Swiss agricultural policy has reduced price support and introduced general and ecological direct payments. This has led to a much higher importance of direct payments for farmers incomes. Our analysis shows that this development has contributed to decreasing hail insurance adoption rates in Switzerland over the period considered. Our results indicate that the larger the share of direct payments for total farm revenue, the less attractive is insurance as a risk management strategy for farmers. This interdependency should be explicitly considered by agricultural policy in the design of support mechanisms.","[Finger, Robert; Lehmann, Niklaus] ETH, Agri Food & Agri Environm Econ Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Finger, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Wageningen University & Research,"Finger, R (通讯作者)，ETH, Agri Food & Agri Environm Econ Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",robert.finger@wur.nl,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",Swiss National Science Foundation in the framework of the National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate); National Research Programme [61],Swiss National Science Foundation in the framework of the National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate); National Research Programme,"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation in the framework of the National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) and the National Research Programme 61.

Since the special properties of agricultural production limit the formation and development of agricultural enterprises, farmer cooperative economy organizations with the main functional characteristics of transaction coordination begin to flourish. By building a new classical economics model, this paper demonstrates the theoretical assertion that the generation of a farmer cooperative economy organization is accompanied by the evolution of the division of labour, the improvement of farmers' effectiveness and the development of agricultural specialization. Furthermore, this paper does an empirical analysis with the micro-survey data to verify this theoretical assertion.

Therefore, a crop's cycle (from planting to felling) should be long enough in order to cover the fixed cost and become profitable. The problem becomes involved when the cycle's duration is stochastic due to occurrence of uncertain event that terminates the cycle prematurely. Studying orchard management under stochastic drought events, we show that to each perennial crop that is profitable without drought hazard, there exists a critical drought hazard above which the crop turns loss making. We refer to this critical drought hazard as the crop's drought vulnerability index and show that it increases with the length of the gestation period, the ratio of fixed cost to average annual profit and the interest rate, and decreases with the natural (uninterrupted) cycle length. We then investigate the economic value of a stable water source, such as recycled water, that stabilizes the water supply and diminishes the drought hazard. An empirical application in northern Israel reveals that the stabilization value of recycled water due to its role in eliminating the drought hazard far exceeds its supply cost.","[Feinerman, Eli; Tsur, Yacov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Feinerman, Eli; Tsur, Yacov] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Agr Econ Res, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Feinerman, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Agr Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",eli.feinerman@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Tsur, Yacov/0000-0001-6374-3838",,,,,22,18,23,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The paper will explore the limitations of existing theory for applied work, and what methodological improvements are needed to enhance the usefulness of the theory to agricultural economists. One pervasive problem is that the economic literature on contracts is rather fragmented and the various methodological strands are narrow in their focus. As such, agricultural economists should engage in methodological research to develop applied contracting models that can capture higher-order features of real-world agricultural contracts while delivering generalizable comparative statics predictions because contracting continues to expand along the entire modern food marketing channel. In the latter part of this article, a simple model is developed to illustrate how classic methodological approaches can be combined with recent developments in contract and game theory to construct applied theory models that are useful for capturing some important features of agricultural contracts.","Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Wu, SY (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sywu@purdue.edu,,,USDA-NIFA [2010-65400-20430],USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Steven Y.

Over the past several decades, erosion control facilities, which are erosion control techniques, have been introduced in Cameroon. No assessment of the impacts of these on farm operations had yet been made. Drawing on data from a survey carried out in 2007 and 2008 and a switching regression model, the study concentrates on the effectiveness of the production factors of parcels of land with and without erosion control facilities. The comparison of the average crop yields of the operations in our sample that either adopted or did not adopt such facilities shows a significant difference, representing up to 10% of the value of the farm production. Proof of a positive selection bias is also found, indicating that the farms with above-average crop yields are more likely to adopt erosion control facilities. Such facilities on the parcels of land also provide an advantage in terms of increasing the productivity of inputs. The analytical approach developed and the positive conclusion of the selection bias can be pertinent to assessing other soil conservation technologies promoted in the area.","[Ngondjeb, Dorothe Yong] Univ Yaounde II, Fac Sci Econ & Gest, Yaounde 13164, Cameroon; [Kamgnia, Bernadette Dia] African Dev Inst, Div Manager African Dev Bank EADI2, Tunis 1002, Tunisia; [Nje, Patrick] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Sci Comptables, Ottawa, ON K1H 8A6, Canada; [Havard, Michel] CIRAD UMR Innovat, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",African Development Bank Group (AfDB); University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; CIRAD,"Ngondjeb, DY (通讯作者)，Univ Yaounde II, Fac Sci Econ & Gest, Yaounde 13164, Cameroon.",njedora@gmail.com; dkamgnia@yahoo.com; lepanje@yahoo.fr; michel.havard@cirad.fr,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Clarifying the effects of agricultural technological progress on deforestation is therefore crucial for designing effective policy responses to the challenges faced by global agriculture. In this article we review the empirical evidence on these effects and synthesize estimates of future global cropland expansion. Our main insights are that: (i) the empirical evidence on a positive link between regional technological progress and deforestation is much weaker than what seems generally accepted; (ii) at a global level, most analysts expect broad based technological progress to be land saving; however, composition effects are important as low-yield, land-abundant regions are likely to experience further land expansion. Toward the future, empirical work understanding how localized technological progress in agriculture transmits through international trade and commodity markets will help to bridge the gap between the findings of local, econometric, studies on the one hand and global, model based, studies on the other.","[Villoria, Nelson B.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Villoria, NB (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",nvillori@purdue.edu,"Byerlee, Derek/HTN-3605-2023",,,,,,79,46,48,2,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The contributions present results from a global economic model intercomparison activity undertaken as part of the AgMIP Project (www.agmip.org). The origins of the comparison activities can be traced to a project that was organized by the OECD in late 2010 to compare results from three models. The current phase of the research includes 10 models and was designed in part to support of the IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5). The special issue includes seven peer-reviewed articles that present thematic results from a range of modeling strategies, with partial and general equilibrium modeling as a high level distinction but a myriad of differences within these two model types. A central common element is harmonization on biophysical effects using crop models and socioeconomic effects using drivers from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways developed as part of the AR5 process. The special issue provides broad insights into how the modeling communities approached the interactions of climate, socioeconomics, bioenergy policy on agricultural outcomes, including land use, prices, consumption, and production.","[Nelson, Gerald C.] IFPRI, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Nelson, Gerald C.] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61801 USA; [Shively, Gerald E.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Nelson, GC (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Champaign, IL 61801 USA.",nelson.gerald.c@gmail.com,"Nelson, Gerald/L-5903-2019",,,,,,0,20,20,0,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Different states harvest and export different lobster species, with most of the landings being sent to the Hong Kong market. A perception in the Australian lobster industry is that the different species are independent on the export market, such that a change in landings of one species has no impact on the price of the others. This study investigates the market integration of Australian exports to Hong Kong for the four species and different exporting states. Our results indicate all four species and producers/export states are perceived to be substitutes for one another, so that, in the long run, prices paid to operators in the industry will move together. The integrated nature of the Hong Kong export market for Australian lobster suggests that the potential impacts of alternative fisheries management and development strategies at state and species levels cannot be considered in isolation, at least from an economic perspective. In addition, impacts of external shocks affecting production in one state (e.g. climate change) can be expected to affect all Australian lobster fisheries.","[Norman-Lopez, Ana; Pascoe, Sean; Thebaud, Olivier; Innes, James; Plaganyi, Eva] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [van Putten, Ingrid; Hobday, Alistair] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Jennings, Sarah; Green, Bridget] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Tasmania,"Norman-López, A (通讯作者)，CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Climate Adaptat Flagship, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",ana.norman@csiro.au,"Green, Bridget S/G-3368-2014; Plaganyi, Eva E/C-5130-2011; van putten, ingrid/AAV-1301-2021; Thebaud, Olivier/D-9792-2011; Hobday, Alistair/A-1460-2012; Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011; Innes, James/D-9424-2011; Jennings, Sarah/J-7888-2014","Plaganyi, Eva E/0000-0002-4740-4200; van putten, ingrid/0000-0001-8397-9768; Thebaud, Olivier/0000-0001-8665-3827; Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649; Innes, James/0000-0003-1975-6062; Jennings, Sarah/0000-0002-5760-4193",FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government [FRDC 2012/233],FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government(Fisheries R&D Corp),"This research was part of the 'Growth opportunities and critical elements in the value chain for wild fisheries and aquaculture in a changing climate (FRDC 2012/233)', which was supported by funding from the FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government.

We performed a sequential mixed method, with the in-depth interviews in the first stage (n = 35), followed by a survey on the Flemish FADN (n = 614) in the second, to investigate the farmers' risk perception, the attitudes towards risk and the perceived usefulness of the risk management strategies. We find that, rather than the short-term volatility in prices, the longer term co-evolution of expenses versus receipts is of a major concern to farmers, next to the land availability and the policy risks. Farmers are shown to be only slightly risk averse, rather risk neutral even. Further, our results suggest that farmers do not consider extensively studied risk management strategies such as contracts, futures and insurances, a valid option for their farm, and put more faith in internal strategies such as the debt management, the liquidity management and diversification. Last, risk management is to a substantial degree performed at the household level, rather than at the farm level, with strategies such as cutting the private expenses and the off-farm employment.

Simultaneous rather than single system estimation utilizes full as opposed to limited information. Econometric results exploit the nonstationary nature of the data and that variables are cointegrated. Under cointegration all variables are endogenous and so it is not necessary to undertake the somewhat ad hoc exercise of choosing instruments to achieve parameter consistency. Johansen's maximum likelihood estimator is applied to data from Central Canada and Western Canada (1935-2006). Symmetry and homogeneity restrictions are not rejected for either region. Monotonicity held for all data points and concavity held at 92% of the data points. Long-run constant returns and Hicks neutral technological change are rejected for both regions. Morishima elasticity estimates coming from the cost function in Western Canada indicate highly elastic long-run substitution between the land/fertilizer input pair and mildly elastic long-run substitution between land and both machinery and labor. In contrast, substitution for land and other inputs is inelastic for the land/machinery pair and the land/labor pair, with only the land/fertilizer pair being mildly elastic. The results indicate the limiting nature of land as a fundamental constraint on long-term agricultural production is a real possibility in Central Canada because other inputs are inelastic, or at best only mildly elastic, substitutes for land. In Western Canada, fertilizer is the only factor that is highly substitutable for land and, therefore, could mitigate the limiting nature of land in that region. However, given that fertilizer applications are often considered to be environmentally unfriendly, the long-run substitution of fertilizer for land as a fundamental mitigating factor to land scarcity in Western Canada is at a cost to the environment.","[Clark, J.

The results reveal interesting new findings on the impacts of R&D on the agri-food industry. The most evident, although not the most immediately apparent, relationship concerns the positive effects of external R&D on business performance. Internal R&D was also revealed to be an important way of enhancing the productivity of SMEs. In addition, the modernisation of the production process through investment in capital goods continues to be the main path to improve competitiveness. However, support was found neither for the inverse relationship, that is the most profitable firms are those that spend the most on R&D, nor for complementarity between external and internal R&D.

We find that efficiency decreases with the number of fields in a geographical cluster, distance between the dwelling and a particular field, discontinuity between fields, and off-farm income. However, environmental diversification (ED) is more detrimental than AD. Using spatial analysis of field and household efficiency measures, we assess production vulnerability to climatic shocks and the potential of ED in mitigating shocks. We find important spatial clusters of low and high efficiencies at the field level suggesting that climatic shocks influence efficiency measures. Household-level efficiency measures exhibit random spatial patterns suggesting that on average households can mitigate the adverse effects of shocks through ED.","[Larochelle, Catherine] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24601 USA; [Alwang, Jeffrey] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Larochelle, C (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24601 USA.",clar-oche@vt.edu,"Larochelle, Catherine/AAF-9194-2020; Alwang, Jeffrey/AAA-1716-2020","Larochelle, Catherine/0000-0001-7655-7380; Alwang, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2950-8516",SANREM CRSP; United States Agency for International Development; USAID [EPP-A-00-04-00013-00],SANREM CRSP; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors thank two anonymous reviewers and Editor David Harvey for helpful suggestions.

However, livestock producers may participate differently than crop producers because some are regulated as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), and because agricultural producers generating manure face different costs of reducing nutrient application (and therefore generating credits) from those only using fertilizer. These differences may affect nutrient reduction credit prices and the supply of agriculturally supplied credits, thereby raising the costs to non-agricultural operations of meeting water quality goals. We examine how CAFO laws interact with nutrient trading requirements. We model trading participation by farm type and then simulate trading participation by applying the model to 2007 Census of Agriculture data.","Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Sneeringer, S (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA.",ssneeringer@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Omitting or imperfectly controlling for these factors can attribute too much observable behaviour to risk aversion and bias estimated preferences. Agents often modify risky decisions in response to dynamic wealth or asset thresholds, where such thresholds exist. Ignoring this dynamic risk response introduces an attribution bias in static estimates of risk aversion. We demonstrate this pitfall using a simple model and a Monte Carlo simulation to explore the implications of this problem for empirical estimation. While an approach that jointly estimates risk preferences and wealth dynamics may remedy the problem by extracting dynamic risk responses from observed behaviour, it is likely to be challenging to implement in broader empirical settings for reasons we discuss.","[Lybbert, Travis J.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Just, David R.; Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Cornell University,"Lybbert, TJ (通讯作者)，Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",tlybbert@ucdavis.edu,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009; Just, David R/K-7302-2012","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721;",,,,,44,8,9,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Determinants of production risk and inefficiency are investigated based on a combination of Just and Popes stochastic production framework and a Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The empirical analysis is conducted using a balanced panel of farm records from 1999/2000 to 2006/2007 on 37 organic and conventional arable farms, respectively. Euclidian-Distance-Matching is used to identify for each organic farm a conventional counterpart with similar structural features. Results indicate that output variability in both production technologies is mainly caused by production risk. Land and labour are identified as risk-increasing inputs in both farm types whereas higher capital endowment, seed costs and soil quality have risk-reducing effects.","[Tiedemann, Torben; Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Kiel; University of Western Australia,"Latacz-Lohmann, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",ulatacz@agric-econ.uni-kiel.de,,"Latacz-Lohmann, Uwe/0000-0002-9936-2460",Fielmann AG,Fielmann AG,"Both authors are with the Department of Agricultural Economics, Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel D-24118, Germany.

Will such discrimination disappear in the future within the current policy-making framework? What is the result of such an endogenous policy change as far as urbanization and economic growth are concerned? Design/methodology/approach - The authors build a theoretical model of rural-urban migration, taking into account the cost of social conflict due to discrimination against urban non-Hukou in local public service. The possibility of endogenous policy change is also considered by numerical simulation. Findings - The authors prove that, in the early stage of urban economic growth when the losses of potential conflicts are relatively small, the exclusive urban public service provision may be beneficial to them, but the losses under such unequal public service provision policy increase in the process of urban growth, and after a certain stage of development, opening public service access equally to the immigrants will be a better choice, even if only the natives' utility is considered. Such an endogenous policy change not only decreases the within-city inequality and conflicts, but also advances the urbanization and urban economic growth. Research limitations/implications - The authors only consider two extreme cases of local public service provision, that is, the urban non-Hukou residents have equal access to public service or they are totally not entitled. The possibility of partial access to local public service is not considered in the model. Originality/value - The authors investigate impact of social conflicts on within-city inequality, urbanization as well as urban economic growth due to unequal social public service within urban residents. The model also shows an endogenous policy change during rural-urban labor migration.","[Chen, Zhao; Liu, Xiaofeng; Lu, Ming] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Chen, Z (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhaochen@fudan.edu.cn,,,"Fudan Lab of China Development Studies, National Social Science Foundation [11AZD084]; 985 Project of Fudan University [2011SHKXZD001]; Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project [B101]","Fudan Lab of China Development Studies, National Social Science Foundation; 985 Project of Fudan University; Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project(Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project)","The authors thank Yoshihiko Seoka, Changyuan Luo, Dihai Wang and seminar participants at CCES and CFSA for their useful comments.

The results show that since China intensified the fiscal and financial support in 2004, the direct effects of fiscal and financial supports for agriculture have improved, but the spatial spillover effects have turned from positive to negative.","[Yuandong, Gao; Tao, Wen; Wen, Yi; Xiaohua, Wang] Southwest Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China,"Tao, W (通讯作者)，Southwest Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",wtwyy@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of Great Invite Public Bidding Project [11ZD047]; Program for New Century Excellent [NCET100662]; National Natural Science Foundation [70973100]; Ministry of Education; Social Science Fund [12YJC790041]; Chongqing Social Science Major Project [2011WTB19],National Social Science Foundation of Great Invite Public Bidding Project; Program for New Century Excellent; National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education; Social Science Fund; Chongqing Social Science Major Project,"Support by the National Social Science Foundation of Great Invite Public Bidding Project (11&ZD047), the Program for New Century Excellent (NCET100662), the National Natural Science Foundation (70973100), the Ministry of Education and Social Science Fund (12YJC790041), Chongqing Social Science Major Project (2011WTB19).",,34,16,16,6,75,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

For crop-livestock farmers, cereal production provides grain and crop residue, where the latter can be used as livestock feed. To properly assess the cost of introducing new technologies into such systems, one must value the implicit cost of byproducts, which is made difficult by missing byproduct markets. We estimate the shadow value of non-market crop stubble using household data from Morocco and find that stubble accounts for around one-quarter of the value of cereal production in a normal rainfall year and three quarters in a drought year.","[Magnan, Nicholas] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Larson, Douglas M.; Taylor, J.

These difference manifest themselves in a hierarchical salary distribution in which members of elite economics departments earn the highest predicted annual salaries, members of elite agricultural economics and middle-ranked economics departments earn middle predicted annual salaries, and members of middle- and lower-ranked agricultural economics and lower-ranked economics departments earn the lowest predicted annual salaries.

This paper also considers the potential endogeneity biases and other explanatory variables as a robustness check of the EKC hypothesis. The empirical results indicate the existence of a strong threshold effect between deforestation and real income, and that evidence of the EKC hypothesis for deforestation is apparent. Along with an increase in real income, deforestation increases initially, and after reaching certain income levels, deforestation drops.

We find that an expansion of biofuel production to meet the existing or even higher targets in various countries would slightly reduce GDP at the global level but with mixed effects across countries or regions. Significant land re-allocation would take place with notable decreases in forest and pasture lands in a few countries. The expansion of biofuels would cause a moderate decrease in world food supply and more significant decreases in developing countries like India and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The paper also aims to find out how poverty lines and poverty counts derived from people's perception relate to what has been previously reported. Design/methodology/approach - The Subjective Poverty Line (SPL) methodology is modified by asking one question on the amount of grains necessary for the respondent's household and another on the amount of cash necessary. Information was obtained from a large survey covering 22 provinces in 2003 and analysed using regressions analysis. Findings - People in high-income counties perceive that more cash, but not grains are needed than those living in low-income counties. Respondents perceive that economies of scale exist in amounts of cash needed for a household. They also perceive that young children need less grain than adults and that a schoolchild incurs higher money expenditures than an adult. A poverty line for rural China derived by the SPL methodology is higher than the low income line used by the National Bureau of Statistics for 2002. However, a poverty count based on the SPL methodology is similar to what has been reported. Practical implications - The findings suggest that poverty lines for rural China preferably should consider not only spatial differences in cost of living but also the number of household members in a non-linear way. Originality/value - The paper describes the first application of the SPL approach to rural China.","[Gustafsson, Bjorn] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Yue, Ximing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Renmin University of China,"Gustafsson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, Gothenburg, Sweden.",Bjorn.Gustafsson@socwork.gu.se,,,"Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Ford Foundation; Ford Foundation, Beijing office","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Ford Foundation; Ford Foundation, Beijing office","The authors wish to acknowledge grants from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the Ford Foundation for funding the collection of the data used for this study.

The study reveals that building the supply chain can increase the efficiency of dairy farmers, as the milk producers who are part of a cooperative supply chain experienced a higher technical efficiency as compared to those who do not follow the modern supply chain practices. The milk producers in the supply chain are found better crisis managers as their inefficiency is the least attributed to their own decisions. The possession of the crossbred livestock, schooling of the manager and the institutional finance have been found affecting the efficiency of the dairy farmers positively and significantly. The study recommends the expansion in the supply chain network of the cooperative milk societies for enhancing the efficiency and profitability of the dairy sector along with the provision of more crossbred livestock and an easy availability of finance.","[Mor, Surender] CDLU, Sirsa 125055, Haryana, India; [Sharma, Supran] SMVDU, Jammu, India",Chaudhary Devi Lal University; Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University,"Mor, S (通讯作者)，CDLU, Sirsa 125055, Haryana, India.",Surender_mor71@rediffmail.com,"Kumar, Supran/ABU-6084-2022; chiu, takeung/A-2046-2013; Mor, Surender/AAR-5694-2021","Kumar, Supran/0000-0003-4716-788X; Mor, Surender/0000-0002-5637-9553",,,,,20,11,12,2,24,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The Indian government sets a unique floor price for each processor that is increasing in the firm's effectiveness in converting cane into sugar. The floor price binds for public and private firms but not for cooperatives, which rebate profits to members. We argue that this price floor policy creates a disincentive for private and public firms to be technically efficient in converting cane to sugar. In support of this hypothesis an analysis of 593 Indian sugar factories from 1992 to 2007 reveals statistically significant differences in technical efficiency, with cooperatives being the most efficient and public firms least efficient. We estimate welfare losses due to the technical inefficiency attributable to the price-floor policy and argue that it can be eliminated by enacting policy to base price floors upon quality of the cane input received by a factory.","[Goodhue, Rachael E.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Patlolla, Sandhyarani] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Goodhue, Rachael/0000-0003-4576-9035",,,,,42,6,7,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This research aims to provide answers to the question as to how to establish and develop functional clusters that will have a positive impact on the development and survival of the regional economy in Serbia. Considering the specific economic situation of underdeveloped regions in Serbia and the constraints concerning the availability of data necessary for research, a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis has been employed. Due to the scarcity of data, it was necessary to collect data both directly from business subjects and from the official statistics. The paper presents the current micro and macro-economic background of the business environment in three sections. The first offers a theoretical sketch of the current geographic and economic theories and their relevance for the business clusters and competitiveness of the country. In the second section, the business location and cluster development tendencies in the country are described. Finally, the third section analyses the most productive industries in Serbia from the cluster development point of view. In the conclusion, recommendations are made which could act as appropriate guidelines for the business innovation strategy of the country.","[Vanka, Gajo M.; Heijman, Wim J.

We recognise that patents are options on the stream of future revenues, and apply option-valuation techniques to determine licence prices. We find that accounting for path-dependency in licence revenue streams generates prices that more nearly approximate observed patent prices. While non-path-dependent prices yield conventional sensitivities to volatility, mean-reversion and returns-growth, path-dependent prices show highly non-linear comparative statics.

This article contributes to the competitiveness literature by measuring the international competitiveness of wheat, beef, and pork sectors in Canada using data from 1961 to 2011 and by determining the drivers of competitiveness. Our results demonstrate that Canada enjoys competitiveness in the wheat sector but not in the beef or pork sectors. Empirical results also suggest that the competitiveness of the Canadian wheat sector can be enhanced if the cost seed in Canada relative to that in the United States is lower. Similarly, if the relative labor cost of meat processing is lower, the competitiveness of both beef and pork sectors in Canada will be enhanced. Exchange rates are important drivers of international competitiveness of beef and pork sectors in Canada. The decoupled farm policies in Canada do not have a significant impact on the competitiveness of wheat and pork sectors in Canada. While our empirical results seem to indicate that major agri-food policies in Canada may not have delivered the expected benefits, the NRCA index did not allow us to separate the contributions of market and nonmarket failures to competitive performance of Canadian agriculture.","[Sarker, Rakhal; Ratnasena, Shashini] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Sarker, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",rsarker@uoguelph.ca; sratnase@uoguelph.ca,,,"Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy Research Network (CATPRN); Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; Institute for the Advanced Study of Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Guelph","Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy Research Network (CATPRN); Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; Institute for the Advanced Study of Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Guelph","This project was funded by the Canadian Agricultural Trade Policy Research Network (CATPRN) and by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

State owned firms grew during the Green Revolution and then stagnated or declined. Indian corporations that were protected from foreign competition are now exporters of agricultural tractors and pesticides. Foreign multinational corporations are rapidly increasing their role in the seed, pesticide, and tractor industries. Entry by large Indian firms and multinationals has increased competition in the input industries. Private agribusiness R&D in India grew from $23 million in 1985 to $250 million in 2009 in 2005 US dollars. This is the same time period as a transformation in the agricultural input industry, rapid growth in demand for agricultural inputs, breakthroughs in information technology and biotechnology, and changes in intellectual property rights. An econometric model was used to test whether the transformation of agricultural input industry was a major factor in the growth of R&D expenditure or not. This article analyzes a unique, firm level sales and R&D data set from the seed, pesticide, tractor, and fertilizer industries in 2000-2009. The estimated model indicates that agribusiness firms' R&D expenditures from 2000 to 2009 were positively related to variables associated with industry transformation such as firm size, ownership by multinationals, and declining industry concentration. The model also indicates that strengthening patent policy as well as growth in the size of research-intensive industries like the seed industry contributed to the growth of agribusiness R&D in India.","[Pray, Carl E.; Nagarajan, Latha] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Nagarajan, Latha] Int Fertilizer Dev Ctr, Muscle Shoals, AL 35662 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Pray, CE (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, 55 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pray@aesop.rutgers.edu,,"Nagarajan, Latha/0000-0003-4516-0772",,,,,31,16,17,2,42,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Our sample contains more than 8 million observations derived from satellite imagery and includes every cultivated field in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. We estimate that aggregate crop acreage responds more to price shocks in the short run than in the long run, and we show theoretically how the benefits of crop rotation generate this response pattern. In essence, farmers who change crops due to a price shock have an incentive to switch back to the previous crop to capture the benefits of crop rotation. Our result contradicts the long-held belief that agricultural supply responds gradually to price shocks through partial adjustment. We would not have obtained this result had we used county-level panel data. Standard econometric methods applied to county-level data produce estimates consistent with partial adjustment. We show that this apparent partial adjustment is illusory, and we demonstrate how it arises from the fact that fields in the same county are more similar to each other than to fields in other counties. This result underscores the importance of using models with appropriate micro-foundations and cautions against inferring micro-level rigidities from inertia in aggregate panel data. Our preferred estimate of the own-price long-run elasticity of corn acreage is 0.29, and the cross-price elasticity is -0.22. The corresponding elasticities for soybean acreage are 0.26 and -0.33. Our estimated short-run elasticities are 37% larger than their long-run counterparts.","[Hendricks, Nathan P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Smith, Aaron; Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif, Agr Issues Ctr, Davis, CA USA",Kansas State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hendricks, NP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",nph@ksu.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011","Hendricks, Nathan/0000-0001-7301-8314",USDA [58-0111-10-005]; National Science Foundation [EPS-0903806]; State of Kansas through the Kansas Board of Regents,USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); State of Kansas through the Kansas Board of Regents,"Nathan P.

Industry structure and information asymmetries can also lead to underinvestment in product quality, even when property rights are well defined. In this article we empirically examine whether the voluntary formation of a marketing cooperative was able to mitigate market failures that led to the production of inferior-quality fish. Specifically, we use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to measure the impact that the Copper River Fishermen's Cooperative, an Alaskan salmon marketing cooperative, had on ex-vessel salmon prices and salmon quality measures. We find that the cooperative was able to improve product quality, as well as attract and sustain a higher price for its salmon. Our findings provide empirical support for many of the key tenets of cooperative theory. Specifically, we find evidence that marketing cooperatives can address existing market failures, that marketing cooperatives can have advantages in high-quality product markets, and that over time, as a result of their success, marketing cooperatives may lead to lasting producer benefits even though they become obsolete due to nonmember free-riding.","[Jardine, Sunny L.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Lin, C. -Y.

This paper combines a comprehensive estimation strategy and a unique panel dataset to study the role of financial insurance in farmers' welfare under uncertainty. Data are drawn from a large Italian farm panel dataset. We find that (i) demand for insurance products is likely to increase in response to climatic conditions, and (ii) that the use of insurance reduces the extent of risk exposure. We also find that farms growing more crops are less likely to adopt the insurance scheme. This confirms what is found in the theoretical literature. Crop diversification can be a substitute for financial insurance in hedging against the impact of risk exposure on welfare.","[Di Falco, Salvatore] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Adinolfi, Felice] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bozzola, Martina] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [Capitanio, Fabian] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Geneva; University of Bologna; University of Naples Federico II,"Di Falco, S (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",salvatore.difalco@unige.ch,"Capitanio, Fabian/E-7806-2011; Bozzola, Martina/AAH-1483-2020; Capitanio, Fabian/J-2815-2016","Bozzola, Martina/0000-0002-0078-842X; ADINOLFI, FELICE/0000-0002-8181-5492; Capitanio, Fabian/0000-0003-0327-8019",,,,,95,125,143,1,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

The case of dairy products,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural policy; Food policy; Agricultural trade,EXPORTS; GRAVITY; ATTRIBUTES; DEMAND; IMPACT,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine how China's food safety standards affect agricultural trade in the case of dairy products. Design/methodology/approach - A gravity model is applied to quantitatively address the impacts of changing food safety standards in China in the case of its dairy imports. The paper considers the trade impacts of not only a specific hazard substance but also overall strictness of safety standards. Findings - The paper shows that changes in food safety standards of dairy products have no effect on China's dairy imports. The finding is not particularly surprising considering special characteristics of China's food safety standards. Given the fact that China's safety standards are relatively lower than that in its major exporters, the trade-impeding effect may not be substantial. Research limitations/implications - First, this study is unable to estimate the trade-enhancing and trade-impending effects separately. Second, the study does not account for a potential endogeneity issue associated with food safety standards. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the debate on how food safety standards affect trade by demonstrating that safety standards in developing countries like China can affect international trade differently from that in developed countries. Although results are specific to China's dairy imports, the explanations are applicable to food safety standards in other developing countries.","[Sun, Dingqiang] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Huang, Jikun; Yang, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of California System; University of California Davis; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Yang, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yjydy.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Yang, Jun/C-8065-2017",,"Qinghua University [CIRS2012-2]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-08-04, KSCX1-YW-09-04, KACX1-YW-0906]; European Community [227202, 044255]; National Sciences Foundation of China [70873116]",Qinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); European Community; National Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of Qinghua University (CIRS2012-2), Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZZD-EW-08-04, KSCX1-YW-09-04, KACX1-YW-0906), the European Community (227202, NTM-IMPACT; 044255, SSPE) and National Sciences Foundation of China (70873116).

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the rural household survey data in Weifang city, Shandong province in northern China, the authors apply recent developed bootstrapped DEA approach to investigate rural technical efficiency at the household level under the consideration of off-farm activities. Rural households are then identified as credit constrained and classified as supply-side and demand-side credit constraints by applying direct elicitation method. Finally, the authors apply a tobit regression to examine the effects of credit constraints on household technical efficiency. Findings - Rural households in China not only suffer supply-side credit constraints, but also demand-side credit constraints resulted from the transaction costs and risk rationing. The tobit regression discloses that demand-side credit constraints impose significant negative impacts on household technical efficiency. Originality/value - The authors clarify the definition of credit constraints and classify the credit constraints into supply-side and demand-side credit constraints.

This research analyzes the effects of the most recent proposals to emerge from WTO negotiations on Canada's chicken industry. We develop a partial-equilibrium model that generates welfare effects for the Canadian chicken industry supply chain. The baseline model is adapted to represent chicken as two distinct products: white meat and dark meat. Simulation results suggest that the welfare effects of current WTO proposals would be small, providing that chicken receives the sensitive products designation. Liberalization leads to higher total welfare in the chicken industry, which is accounted for by consumer welfare that increases by a larger amount than producer welfare decreases. The results are very sensitive to the disaggregation of chicken as two products; a finding that should inform future research.","[Rafajlovic, Juanita; Cardwell, Ryan] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Cardwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",juteraf@gmail.com; ryan_cardwell@umanitoba.ca,,"Cardwell, Ryan/0000-0002-4441-3427",,,,,33,6,6,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

However, the adoption rates of SAPs remain below expected levels. This study analyses the factors that facilitate or impede the probability and level of adoption of interrelated SAPs, using recent data from multiple plot-level observations in rural Ethiopia. Multivariate and ordered probit models are applied to the modelling of adoption decisions by farm households facing multiple SAPs, which can be adopted in various combinations. The results show that there is a significant correlation between SAPs, suggesting that adoptions of SAPs are interrelated. The analysis further shows that both the probability and the extent of adoption of SAPs are influenced by many factors: a household's trust in government support, credit constraints, spouse education, rainfall and plot-level disturbances, household wealth, social capital and networks, labour availability, plot and market access. These results imply that policy-makers and development practitioners should seek to strengthen local institutions and service providers, maintain or increase household asset bases and establish and strengthen social protection schemes in order to improve the adoption of SAPs.","[Kassie, Menale; Shiferaw, Bekele] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Nairobi, Kenya; [Teklewold, Hailemariam] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Gothenburg,"Kassie, M (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Nairobi, Kenya.",m.kassie@cgiar.org,"Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022","Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Shiferaw, Bekele/0000-0002-3645-320X",Swedish International Development and Cooperation Agency through the Environmental Economics Unit; University of Gothenburg; Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research,Swedish International Development and Cooperation Agency through the Environmental Economics Unit; University of Gothenburg; Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research,"The household surveys for this research were supported by the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) under the CIMMYT-led project 'Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Systems for Food Security in Eastern and Southern Africa (SIMLESA)'.

The model is used to estimate live and salvage timber harvest subsidies needed to incorporate disturbance-mitigating benefits before and after three types of natural disturbance: insect outbreak, storm, and wildfire. While not specific to a particular country or state, results indicate that the degree of forest mortality may be a poor metric for gauging management response due to various degrees of endogeneity across different types of disturbance events.

Published studies estimating the economic value of recreational fishing in Australia and New Zealand are limited, although the economic and social benefits associated with this activity are sizable and the importance of understanding the behaviour of recreational fishers for the sustainable management of aquatic resources is well recognised. In our contingent valuation surveys, we use a double-bounded version of the dichotomous choice question, which improves the statistical efficiency of the estimates relative to those based on a single dichotomous choice question. We test and control for response bias, in the form of anchoring and a shift effect, that may occur in data collected using a double-bounded dichotomous choice (DBDC) elicitation format. We highlight the importance of identifying and correcting for response bias in DBDC models on a case-by-case basis. Our estimation results show that there is no significant difference in the willingness to pay for a day of recreational fishing across individuals who caught different number of fish in either fishery. This suggests that high and low catch fishers placed the same value on a day's fishing.","[Yamazaki, Satoshi; Rust, Steven; Jennings, Sarah] Univ Tasmania, Sch Econ & Finance, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lyle, Jeremy; Frijlink, Sven] Univ Tasmania, IMAS FAC, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Yamazaki, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Sch Econ & Finance, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",satoshi.yamazaki@utas.edu.au,"Yamazaki, Satoshi/J-7538-2014; Jennings, Sarah/J-7888-2014; Lyle, Jeremy/J-7170-2014","Yamazaki, Satoshi/0000-0003-1279-2706; Jennings, Sarah/0000-0002-5760-4193; Lyle, Jeremy/0000-0001-9670-5854; Rust, STeven/0000-0002-1689-0437","Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment; Fishwise Community; Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies","Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment; Fishwise Community; Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies","The authors would like to acknowledge the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment for funding support for this study through the Fishwise Community Grant scheme and the team of survey interviewers from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies.

It also identifies the micro-level factors for which households pay different amount of bribe. To attain these objectives, experiences of 210 Bangladeshi farm households belonging to six different districts of the country are analyzed. The econometric analyses show that the households with higher expenditure are more likely to face corruption and bribery, and also pay a higher amount of bribe. However, these households are less likely to face the negligence of duty and nepotism or favouritism. Such differences in the impact of the expenditure variable can be argued to be the outcome of a situation where corruption is pervasive and the officials have the bribe maximizing objective. Relationships with different power entities reduce the households' probability to face corruption and its different forms, and can avoid a higher bribe payment. The results argue for several policy actions for combating corruption in the country.","[Anik, Asif Reza] BSMRAU, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh; [Bauer, Siegfried] Univ Giessen, Giessen, Germany; [Alam, Mohammad Jahangir] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh",Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU); Justus Liebig University Giessen; Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU),"Anik, AR (通讯作者)，BSMRAU, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh.",anikbd1979@gmail.com,"Anik, Asif Reza/Y-4630-2019","Anik, Asif Reza/0000-0002-0461-6094; Alam, Mohammad Jahangir/0000-0003-3412-9438",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The present study is a part of the first author's Ph.D, which was conducted with the financial support from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).",,36,4,4,1,12,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - After a review of trust literature this study classifies trust into three distinct types: supplier-level specific trust, industry-level specific trust and general trust. The direct and indirect relationships between three types of trust and consumer perceptions of food safety were studied through a survey of 1165 consumers from Beijing municipality, China using structural equation model as an analytical tool. Findings - The results indicate that trust in manufacturers and trust in retailers are directly positively related to food safety perceptions. Trust in farmers is not directly related to food safety perceptions. Industry-level specific trust is not related to food safety perceptions directly, but it is positively related to supplier-level specific trust, which in turn is positively related to food safety perceptions. Finally, general trust has only a weak indirect positive effect through its effect on trust in food manufacturers. Practical implications - The results imply that consumer perceived safety of food products might be enhanced by improving consumer trust in manufacturers and trust in retailers. The results also suggest that food suppliers are more difficult to build consumer trust when industry-level specific trust is low and declining. In addition, food suppliers also get potential benefits through influencing and improving industry-level specific trust. At last, the results suggest that some concerns about food safety are related to individuals' world reviews and maybe beyond the control of the food system. Originality/value - This study is the first to investigate the relationship between different types of specific trust in the context of food safety. Accordingly, it complements existing trust models and helps predict and explain how trust relates to food safety perceptions directly and indirectly through interactions between different types of trust.","Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Chen, WP (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenweipingruc@gmail.com,"chen, weidong/JZT-5874-2024; Chen, Wei/GZK-7348-2022","chen, weidong/0009-0006-1337-808X;",National Science Foundation [70972132]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Renmin University of China [11XNJ022],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Renmin University of China,"The research was funded by the National Science Foundation grant (No. 70972132), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (No. 11XNJ022).

The results reveal that the organic systems exhibit an increasing return to scale whilst, the conventional system exhibit decreasing returns to scale. All the inputs variables positively influence the production except the age of trees. The combined effects of operational and farm specific factors are identified to influence the technical efficiency although the individual effects of some variables are not significant. The mean technical efficiency relative to the meta-frontier is estimated to be 0.59 for the organic and 0.71 for the conventional farms. The study concludes that the conventional system of cocoa production is more technically efficient than the organic system. However, the increase in the scale of production in the organic system to take advantage of the economies of scale may enhance the efficiency of production.","[Onumah, Justina Adwoa] Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, Cantonments Accra, Ghana; [Onumah, Edward Ebo; Al-Hassan, Ramatu Mahama] Univ Ghana, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Legon, Ghana; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Ghana; University of Gottingen,"Onumah, JA (通讯作者)，STEPRI CSIR, Sci & Technol Policy Res Inst, POB CT 519, Cantonments Accra, Ghana.",justina.onumah@csir-stepri.org,"Onumah, Edward Ebo/HLQ-0366-2023; Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Onumah, Justina Adwoa/0000-0002-6508-9339",,,,,22,25,25,0,22,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The objectives of this paper are to investigate the technical efficiency (TE) and cost efficiency (CE) of apple orchard and to analyse determinants which affect apple production efficiency. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper conducts a two-stage DEA to achieve the objectives. In the first-stage, a cost minimization model is applied to measure apple production efficiency. Then, a Tobit model is provided to estimate regression coefficients which are used to adjust the efficiency scores in the first-stage. Findings - The results indicate that TE and CE are rather low in Shaanxi. The research also explores that the inefficient production of apple farmers is caused mainly by two aspects. One is the inefficient apple orchards operation of farmers. The other is the disadvantageous environmental conditions which heavily affect apple growth and fruit bearing situation. Originality/value - Most of the research are based on national statistical data, and only measure the TE. This paper primarily focuses on the estimation of efficiency scores with the data involved in both quantity and price information of traditional inputs and outputs based on 255 apple farmers in Shaanxi. Specifically, This paper also consider farmer's opportunity cost to which little literature refers. The results not only reveal the efficient determinants of apple production, but also provide suggestions for agricultural policy makers.","[Wang, Lijia; Huo, Xuexi] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Kabir, Md Shajahan] Northwest A&F Univ, Ctr Western Rural Dev, Yangling, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China,"Huo, XX (通讯作者)，Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China.",xuexihuo@nwsuaf.edu.cn,"Huo, Xuexi/GPG-3739-2022","Huo, Xuexi/0000-0002-8263-9101",,,,,34,18,21,1,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

On this basis, establishing the dynamic panel data model, using the generalized method of moments (GMM) to analyze the dynamic impact of the fiscal decentralization and the local government competition on the farmland conversion from the view of three cross-regional groups and the mainland China. The results show that there is a long-run co-integration relationship between the fiscal decentralization, the farmland conversion and the local government competition, and also there is a positive significant influence of the fiscal decentralization and the local government competition on the farmland conversion, a 1% increase in the degree of fiscal decentralization will increase the area of farmland conversion by 0.3280%. In addition, there is a significant difference of the incentive effect of local government competition on the farmland conversion in different regions. The paper ends with policy suggestions for perfecting the system of the fiscal decentralization, taxation and the division of responsibility and authority, reforming the criterion of the political achievement assessment, strengthening the management of land revenue, reducing the reliance of the local government on land finance; at the same time, the farmers' land property rights should be perfected.","[Xu Hengzhou; Yin Hongchun] Tianjin Univ, Sch Management, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Guo Yuyan] Jiangsu Acad Social Sci, Inst Social Policy, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Xu, HZ (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Sch Management, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",xuhengzhou@tju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203157, 41101537]; Research Center of Public Resources Management of Tianjin University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Center of Public Resources Management of Tianjin University,The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71203157 and 41101537) and the Research Center of Public Resources Management of Tianjin University for providing financial support to the research.

Access to technologies may also differ within regions because producers may apply different technologies in production due to different characteristics. Within this setting, we extend the existing literature by considering that producers face region- and farm-specific production frontiers. The treatment of essentially heterogeneous technical efficiency (TE) is performed following a two-step procedure. First, a random coefficient specification of the production technology is used to measure the interactions of technology adoption with time, input factors, and output. Second, linear programming techniques are employed to envelop the optimal level of technology. This procedure is applied to household-level data from eastern, central, and western provinces in China. Our results provide evidence that TE is significantly affected by farm heterogeneity. This factor influences TE directly as a producer-specific input, and indirectly through interaction with observable inputs such as land, labor, capital, and intermediate inputs. Our results also prove the assumption that farming technology exhibits region-specific characteristics. Furthermore, there is a disparity of TE across provinces that narrows over the study period and is driven by the shifts of production to the metafrontier.","[Hockmann, Heinrich] Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Wang, Xiaobing; Bai, Junfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Hockmann, H (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",xbwang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; Hockmann@iamo.de; jfbai.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"China Agriculture Research System; Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO); National Science Foundation of China [71073155, 71173204]",China Agriculture Research System; Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by China Agriculture Research System, Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO), and National Science Foundation of China (Grant: 71073155 and 71173204).

A multivariate tobit model that accounts for potential substitutability and complementarity of investment options, as well as endogeneity of tenure arrangements was employed in the empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that land tenure arrangements influence farmers decisions to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures. In particular, owner-cultivators with secured tenancy arrangements were found to be more likely to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures, compared to those on leased contracts. We also find that output per hectare was highest on land cultivated by owners and lowest on land under sharecropping tenancy, lending support to the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis.","[Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, D-24103 Kiel, Germany; [Ali, Akhter] NARC, Social Sci Res Inst, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Goetz, Renan] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona 17071, Spain",University of Kiel; National Agricultural Research Council - Pakistan; Universitat de Girona,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Olshausenstr 40, D-24103 Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021; Goetz, Renan/G-3158-2015",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789; Goetz, Renan/0000-0002-4672-8502","Center for Food Security and the Environment, Stanford University; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECON 2010-17020]; Barcelona GSE; Government of Catalonia","Center for Food Security and the Environment, Stanford University; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE; Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya)","The authors have benefited from the comments and suggestions of three anonymous reviewers and the journal editor, Gerald Shively.

Transaction costs can affect not only whether a farmer sells product but also whether sales occur at the farm gate or at a market. If production behavior is related to a chosen sales location, then analysis of interventions can be improved by explicit consideration of the decision of where to sell. This article develops a double-selection model that explains consumption and production decisions by semi-subsistence farmers who first decide whether to be a seller and then whether to sell at the farm gate or at an off-farm location before deciding on production and consumption. The study tests the validity of this dual-criteria model against a single-criterion model in which a grower first decides to be a seller and then decides production, consumption, and sales location simultaneously. The results suggest that the dual-criteria model provides more information than the single-criterion model using a sample of cassava producer in Benin.","[Takeshima, Hiroyuki] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Winter-Nelson, Alex] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Takeshima, H (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",H.takeshima@cgiar.org,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAN-6611-2021; Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAO-3212-2021","Takeshima, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1761-408X;",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [ILLU-470-370],USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their detailed suggestions and to Carl Nelson, Mary Arends-Kuenning, and an anonymous reviewer of a Discussion Paper version of this research from the IFPRI for their valuable comments.

We draw on a set of nationwide, household-level panel data (for 2000 and 2008) and find that the markets for cultivated land rental have emerged robustly. According to our data, 19 of China's cultivated land was rented in farm operators in 2008. We also find that the nature of China's cultivated land rental contracts has become more formal and lengthened the period of time that the tenant is able to cultivate the rented-in plots. While there may be benefits for lessors and tenants, our data show that there are falling rates of investment in organic manure. The farmers in our sample have reduced organic manure use from 13 tons/ha in 2000 to 5 tons/ha in 2008. Part of this fall is due to the rise of cultivated land rental markets. The analysis, however, does not find that improved property rights in cultivated land rental affect investment largely because property rights have largely been established by 2000, the first year of our sample. Our results, however, also show that there are forces that appear to be mitigating the negative consequences of rising cultivated land rental. After holding constant initial rental rates and other factors, we find that the gap between investment in organic manure in own land and rented-in land is narrowing. One interpretation of our findings is that if policymakers can find ways to even further strengthen the rights of lessors and tenants as well as lengthen contract periods, farmerseven those that rentwill invest more in their land, because they will be able to capture the returns to their investments.","[Gao, Liangliang; Huang, Jikun; Rozelle, Scott] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gao, Liangliang] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Stanford University","Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Gao, Liangliang/L-7388-2019",,"Ministry of Agriculture; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX1-YW-09-04, 2009S1-37]; World Bank; International Food Policy Research Institute; IAMO; Michigan State University",Ministry of Agriculture(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); World Bank(The World Bank India); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); IAMO; Michigan State University,"The authors acknowledge the financial supports of Ministry of Agriculture (Soft Science Project), Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX1-YW-09-04, 2009S1-37), World Bank, International Food Policy Research Institute, IAMO, and Michigan State University.",,25,90,103,7,120,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.
